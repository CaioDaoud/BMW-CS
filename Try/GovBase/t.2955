access to the ADC holdings The ADC now has over 911 astronomical catalogs and 2022 journal tables retrievable on line via anonymous FTP For direct FTP access from Internet connect as follows ftp adc gsfc nasa gov Log in as anonymous Once connected move to the pub adc archives subdirectory which is the root of the catalog and journal table archive directories You will normally find a key file present at each level of the directory tree which contains an index of each subdirectory Please note that all catalogs and journal tables except for the ReadMe files and other miscellaneous documentation files are stored in a UNIX compressed format The ReadMe file should be read first it normally contains the catalog and journal table identification a summary of the files description of the data and format description When copying the files via anonymous FTP be sure to use the binary option and the decompression program gunzip on the copied files in order to obtain the original files

Miscellaneous I would like to buy a star name Can you provide me with some information In response to numerous inquiries on the subject of purchasing star names the International Astronomical Union IAU offers the following information The IAU receives an increasing number of requests from individuals who want to buy stars or star names or name stars after other persons The IAU is aware that some commercial enterprises purport to offer such services for a fee The fact is that such names have no formal or official validity whatever a few bright stars have ancient traditional Arabic names but otherwise stars have just numbers and positions on the sky To see that the idea of buying stars or star names is inherently absurd consider that there are perhaps 100 000 000 000 stars in our Milky Way Galaxy alone where other beings might in principle compete on the market Stars cannot be fenced in taken home or locked up in a vault Like so many of the best things in life the beauty of the night sky is not for sale but is there for all to enjoy However there is now a way to explore the sky in your own home Large sky surveys have become available in digital form on CD ROM e g from the Astronomical Society of the Pacific mailto catalog aspsky org catalog aspsky org This allows everyone to browse among many hundreds of millions of stars on your home computer These maps are the main data base of at least some of the commercial star naming enterprises why pay a markup for buying the stars one at a time For the sake of completeness it is noted that these rules apply also to naming star clusters or galaxies as well as to individual stars Can you direct me to an electronic version of the Astronomical Almanac The Astronomical Almanac is published by the US Naval Observatory
