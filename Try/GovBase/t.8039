invasive noxious weeds in the West on rangeland and in crops are exotic species Invasive exotics Photograph of leafy spurge impact the American farmer and rancher through reduced profitability and increased input costs due to increased use of chemical controls These costs reduce producer profits and US competitiveness in national and international markets Noxious weeds can reduce biodiversity and quality of wildlife habitat on range and in natural resource areas A study of leafy spurge estimated the total economic impact of this weed in North Dakota South Dakota Montana and Wyoming at 144 million in 1995 The total impact of another exotic spotted knapweed was estimated at 40 million in Montana alone The USDI Bureau of Land Management estimates 19 million acres of land under their management will be infested with weeds by the year 2000 Biological control an ecologically sensitive strategy using insects mites plant pathogens and nematodes is the foundation of integrated exotic weed management In addition to the ecological benefits biological control will reduce producer expenditures on chemicals ARS research in biological control is critical because of the widespread

root feeding insect biocontrol agents have been isolated and identified in domestic and foreign surveys ARS has developed technology to stabilize formulate and apply all classes of microbial biocontrol agents Mass reared biocontrol agents would help reduce the abundance of noxious weeds in a timely manner and would provide an abundant source of readily available agents providing immediate weed intervention This new technology would reduce weed impact on agricultural and environmental problems in the U S and Canada Successful development of rearing culturing formulation technology will

play an important role in North American grassland ecosystems serving as food for wildlife and contributing to nutrient cycling However periodic grasshopper outbreaks on rangeland can result in competition with other herbivores for vegetation and lead to grasshopper dispersal into crops Of the 400 species of grasshoppers in the Western United States fewer than 2 dozen are capable of causing significant economic damage to crops and forage In the past pesticide application has been the main tool used to combat grasshopper outbreaks on rangeland Due to increased environmental concerns and economic costs associated with pesticide use we are currently investigating ecologically based approaches to grasshopper management Very little research has examined preventative strategies that reduce the likelihood or intensity of grasshopper outbreaks Developing ways to prevent grasshopper outbreaks requires that we understand the ecological interactions underlying these outbreaks and can manipulate them accordingly Certain types of grazing or habitat management may create unfavorable habitats for grasshoppers or spur increases in naturally occurring grasshopper diseases and predators In addition microbial products may provide environmentally benign management options when warranted Photograph of Melanoplus bivittatus killed by The Summitt Disease Fungus Entomophoga grylli The top

cricket outbreaks originate on rangeland and can lead to the formation of large migratory bands that move into and damage crop systems At NPARL scientists are examining Mormon cricket migratory behavior as a means to ultimately identify potential outbreak areas and predict subsequent band movement patterns Researchers are conducting laboratory analyses of Mormon cricket behavior in order to Photograph of a mormon cricket determine the environmental factors that lead to the formation of migratory bands If scientists understand what causes Mormon cricket bands to form they can predict where they are likely to occur and potentially intervene to prevent their formation Mormon crickets are thought to express density dependent phase polyphenism similar to that observed in swarming locust species If this can be verified scientists may be able to apply what is known about the ecology of phase transformation in locusts to the Mormon cricket problem in the US In collaboration with Darryl Gwynne and Pat Lorch of the University of Toronto at Mississauga NPARL researchers are using a combination of radiotelemetry and harmonic radar to track the movement of migratory Mormon cricket bands across the landscape Correlating band movement with local topography and weather conditions will enable researchers to predict migratory band movement patterns The ability to predict where migratory bands will go will allow scientists to identify specific areas that are in danger of Mormon cricket invasion and enable them to fine tune control efforts Both of these outcomes will help to reduce the undesirable non target effects of chemical control and fine tune existing management schemes Contributing Scientists personnel gsword html Greg Sword Goals Right directional arrow pointing

of wheat in the northern Great Plains since large scale cereal crop cultivation began more than 100 years ago Field infestations of Photograph of a female wheat stem sawfly 70 to 80 have been recorded at several locations and in several years Yield losses are the result of larval feeding which can reduce grain weight by more than 20 and fallen grain due to stem cutting Yield losses of up to 35 have been reported in some locations and across the region annual losses to wheat and other cereal crops can exceed US 100 million Current management practices are limited to using resistant wheat cultivars or various tillage operations to destroy sawfly larvae or pupae in the stubble Several resistant cultivars have been developed and released over the past 10 years These cultivars have solid stems filled with pith and suffer less damage when sawfly numbers are high Unfortunately they often yield less or have lower protein content than hollow stemmed cultivars Spring or fall tillage may also reduce populations of wheat stem sawfly though this management practice requires additional field operations increases production costs and may increase soil erosion rates Pesticides are generally too costly and largely ineffective because the larvae are protected within the stem Another important approach to managing pests is biological control Several native parasites attack the wheat stem sawfly in the Great Plains though they are usually not effective in preventing damage At the Northern Plains Agricultural Research Laboratory in Sidney the possibility of finding and utilizing natural enemies of the wheat stem sawfly is currently being investigated Map displaying the movement of the wheat stem sawfly and its natural enemies to the United States Photograph of a

ROOT MAGGOT BIOLOGICAL CONTROL Rationale The Sugar beet Root Maggot Tetanops myopaeformis is considered the most important Photograph of Beauveria bassiana sporulating in the surface of a sugar beet root maggot insect pest of sugar beets in the U S affecting production on more than 1 250 000 acres Yield losses of 20 40 are common where insecticides are not used for control The primary control method for these insects are planting time insecticides Most are highly toxic restricted use compounds continued use of these few insecticides is also likely to lead to resistance Alternative biologically based and environmentally benign strategies are needed Entomopathogenic fungi such as Beauveria bassiana and Metarhizium anisopliae have been developed as microbial insecticides for other insect in the U S and other countries Isolates of either of these two fungi could serve as the insect control component of a broader IPM system that also incorporates microorganisms to control sugar
