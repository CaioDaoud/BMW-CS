critical applications They were created only to illustrate our publications and are not accurate enough to be used for any other purposes These are vector format maps Unlike raster images they can be rescaled without distortion The maps were created in ArcGIS 8 3 and consist of polyline segments The dates of these shorelines are fairly recent ranging from 1988 to 1995 Three file formats are

the coastal regions of Maryland the Chesapeake Bay its tributaries the coastal bays and the Atlantic coast MGS contracted the services of EarthData International Inc EDI currently of Frederick Md to extract shorelines from an existing wetlands delineation which was based on photo interpretation of 3 75 minute digital orthophoto quarter quads DOQQs In areas where a wetlands coverage was not yet available EDI interpreted shorelines directly from the orthophotography DOQQ registration Maryland State Plane Coordinate System NAD 83 meters was transferred automatically to the shoreline vectors Following shoreline extraction or interpretation EDI assigned attributes to the vectors based on shoreline type beach vegetated structure or water s edge The data set contains recent shoreline vectors for sixteen coastal counties and Baltimore City with assigned shoreline types The vectors represent shoreline positions between the years 1988 and 1995 Spatial Reference Information Map Projection

was not tide coordinated Therefore shorelines in this data set does not represent a consistent vertical datum Shoreline Attributes beach vegetated structure water s edge All four categories are linear features except beach which if sufficiently wide can be both linear and polygonal Shorelines were merged into 7 5 minute quadrangles provided that the aerial photography on which the DOQQs were based was flown in the same year Please see the vmap SLMetadata html complete metadata online or attached to each downloaded data file updated 9 5 03 javascript history go 1 Return to previous page index
