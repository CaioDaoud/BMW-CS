most of us getting to work getting to the doctor or getting to church means getting in our car But for many people it s not that easy there are often many challenges that individuals face when trying to get a ride It s not that we governments community organizations haven t tried to help Nearly every human service program recognizes that transportation is important In fact there are 62 federal programs that fund transportation services And we through our taxes and through our charitable contributions are spending a significant amount of money in order to help Ironically for most people who need transportation help the creation of more programs hasn t made getting around much easier We recognize that the key to using these services more efficiently is coordination The Department of Transportation with its partners at the Departments of Health and Human Services Labor and Education are launching United We Ride a new five part initiative to break down the barriers between programs and set the stage for local partnerships that generate common sense solutions and deliver A plus performance for everyone who needs transportation The United We Ride initiative will include http www

Individualized Marketing Info html click here The Federal Transit Administration is undertaking a research demonstration program aimed at increasing public transit ridership with a minimal need for new capital investment all the while maintaining people s mobility Called Individualized Marketing the concept has proven successful in Europe and Australia and has shown promising results in Portland Oregon The FTA will be investing federal resources in a partnership with transit agencies in four competitively selected pilot communities in the U S The FTA s pilot project centers around personalized individual marketing of potential commuters who might consider using public transit but need more information Taking transit to the people has proven to be a unique method of boosting ridership without increased spending on infrastructure Utilizing a dialog based technique for promoting the use of public transport the program provides targeted personalized customized marketing tailored for individuals that are most likely to change their travel behavior The FTA will fund contractor support who will perform the Individualized Marketing Pilot in the four selected locations in close coordination and partnership with the transit agencies and local officials of the city area The primary model for this project is the UITP International Public Transportation Association project conducted in Europe The UITP project involved 45 transit agencies from over 15 countries The Switching to Public Transport experiment was very successful in demonstrating that effective individualized marketing can significantly increase the level of ridership bolstering the theory that a new customer consciousness has developed in which people view public transit more favorably and are leaning in the direction of considering transit as the single auto congestion continues to worsen Pilot projects in both Europe and Australia have yielded a reduction in car usage in the area targeted for the project of around 10 while large scale individualized marketing efforts 35 000 population yielded up to 14 reductions results tracked after one and two years A 1999 independent cost benefit analysis of the Perth Australia demonstration project yielded a 1 13 return on investment The first U S pilot project in Portland Oregon yielded a reduction in car travel of 8 in the area selected for the pilot and an increase in travel by environmentally friendly modes in the same area of 27 The one year evaluation of the pilot s success was begun in September 2003 and Portland officials have indicated that if the results hold firm they will consider replicating the process throughout the city Now the FTA is taking the project to four locations in the United States teaming with local transit authorities and local governments that will be selected on a competitive basis to be part of this promising pilot Each location will have unique characteristics to test the true potential of the individualized marketing concept The FTA anticipates that application criteria and procedures will be made available on our website and sent out to interested parties by mid November 2003 Completed applications expressions of interest will be due to the FTA by mid January 2004 http www fta dot gov office pubaffrs reducing car use pdf CLICK HERE for a background piece that will help
