SIME DIME83 Overview of the Final Report of the Seattle Denver Income Maintenance Experiment SIME DIME May 1983 This report summarizes the Final Report of the SIME DIME negative income tax experiments While the results on marital stability were the most controversial at the time the labor supply effects have been of more enduring interest The labor supply results are quite complex the average annual reduction in hours worked was very roughly 9 men or 20 women but most people did not change their work effort at all rather a small number reduced their work effort a relatively large amount Even those that did reduce their work effort did not reduce the hours worked on a particular job but rather lengthened the time between jobs The Overview explains in detail these and many other
