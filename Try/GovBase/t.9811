sites The public health professional must understand the needs of the community and be able to facilitate dialogue concerning the technical issues of public health risk and the psychological political social and economic needs of the community The purpose of this Primer is to provide a framework of principles and approaches for the communications of health risk information to diverse audiences It is intended for ATSDR staff and personnel from other government agencies and private organizations who must respond to public concerns about exposure to hazardous substances in the environment The Primer begins with brief descriptive material about the mission of ATSDR and the importance of local community involvement in the health risk communication process The remainder of the Primer is devoted to a discussion of issues and guiding principles for communicating health risk accompanied by specific suggestions for presenting information to the public and for interacting effectively with the media Although the Primer attempts to identify principles relevant to and consistent with effective health risk communication practice it is not intended to suggest that a standard of health risk communication effectiveness is measured solely on the number of principles that are employed Rather the manner in which the guidance should be applied will vary from case to case based on needs priorities and other considerations US Department Of Health And Human Services Public Health Service Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry Division of Health Education CONTENTS Table of Contents The ATSDR Mission The Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry ATSDR created by the US Congress in 1980 is a federal Public Health Service agency and part of the US Department of Health and Human Services The mission of the Agency for Toxic Substances and disease Registry is to prevent exposure and adverse human health effects and diminished quality of life associated with exposure to hazardous substances from waste sites unplanned releases and other sources of pollution present in the environment The Role and Importance of Community Involvement in ATSDR Health Risk Communication Health risk communication is an emerging area of emphasis and importance at ATSDR and in parts of the broader public health community Over the past decade health risk communication has played an integral part in ATSDR s comprehensive efforts to prevent or mitigate adverse human health outcomes related to hazardous substance exposure It is ATSDR s responsibility to ensure that decisions are made using the best available information Community residents site personnel citizen groups health professionals and state and local government representatives are all unique sources of information needed by ATSDR to effectively communicate about the public health risks of exposure to hazardous substances They can provide information concerning site background community health concerns demographics land and natural resource use environmental contamination environmental pathways and health outcomes Information is needed from the community at several points in the health risk communication process Involving the community in the information gathering process makes ATSDR communications more credible and sets the stage for community participation in helping to resolve problems Communities need and want to be actively involved in identifying characterizing and solving problems that affect their lives CONTENTS Table of Contents Overview of Issues and Guiding Principles for Health Risk Communication Merely disseminating information without regard for communicating the complexities and uncertainties of risk does not necessarily ensure effective risk communication Well managed efforts will help ensure that your messages are constructively formulated transmitted and received and that they result in meaningful actions Consider how the process works and some general principles for improving effectiveness CONTENTS Table of Contents Risk Communication Myths and Actions Chess et al 1988 Belief in some common myths often interferes with development of an effective risk communication program Consider the myths and actions you can take Myth We don t have enough time and resources to have a risk communication program Action Train all your staff to communicate more effectively Plan projects to include time to involve the public Myth Telling the public about a risk is more likely to unduly alarm people than keeping quiet Action Decrease potential for alarm by giving people a chance to express their concerns Myth Communication is less important than education If people knew the true risks they would accept them Action Pay as much attention to your process for dealing with people as you do to explaining the data Myth We shouldn t go to the public until we have solutions to environmental health problems Action Release and discuss information about risk management options and involve communities in strategies in which they have a stake Myth These issues are too difficult for the public to understand Action Separate public disagreement with your policies from misunderstanding of the highly technical issues Myth Technical decisions should be left in the hands of technical people Action Provide the public with information Listen to community concerns Involve staff with diverse backgrounds in developing policy Myth Risk communication is not my job Action As a public servant you have a responsibility to the public Learn to integrate communication into your job and help others do the same Myth If we give them an inch they ll take a mile Action If you listen to people when they are asking for inches they are less likely to demand miles Avoid the battleground Involve people early and often Myth If we listen to the public we will devote scarce resources to issues that are not a great threat to public health Action Listen early to avoid controversy and the potential for disproportionate attention to lesser issues Myth Activist groups are responsible for stirring up unwarranted concerns Action Activists help to focus public anger Many environmental groups are reasonable and responsible Work with groups rather than against them CONTENTS Table of Contents Seven Cardinal Rules of Risk Communication Covello and Allen 1988 Accept and involve the public as a partner Your goal is to produce an informed public not to defuse public concerns or replace actions Plan carefully and evaluate your efforts Different goals audiences and media require different actions Listen to the public s specific concerns People often care more about trust credibility competence fairness and empathy than about statistics and details Be honest frank and open Trust and credibility are difficult to obtain once lost they are almost impossible to regain Work with other credible sources Conflicts and disagreements among organizations make communication with the public much more difficult Meet the needs of the media The media are usually more interested in politics than risk simplicity than complexity danger than safety Speak clearly and with compassion Never let your efforts prevent your acknowledging the tragedy of an illness injury or death People can understand risk information but they may still not agree with you some people will not be satisfied CONTENTS Table of Contents Knowing Your Publics The likelihood of achieving a successful risk communication program increases with your knowledge of those with whom you are communicating Early in the process know who your publics are what their concerns are how they perceive risk and whom they trust Identification Co workers Area residents Elected officials Civic organizations Health care providers Media Regulatory agencies Environmental activists Contractors Other Characteristics Concerns Attitudes Levels of interest Levels of involvement Histories Levels of knowledge Opinions Reasons for interest Types of involvement Are they potential supporters or potential adversaries Categories of Public Concern Health Safety Environment Economics Aesthetics Fairness Process Legalities CONTENTS Table of Contents Factors Influencing Risk Perception Fischhoff et al 1981 People s perceptions of the magnitude of risk are influenced by factors other than numerical data Risks perceived to be voluntary are more accepted than risks perceived to be imposed Risks perceived to be under an individual s control are more accepted than risks perceived to be controlled by others Risks perceived to be have clear benefits are more accepted than risks perceived to have little or no benefit Risks perceived to be fairly distributed are more accepted than risks perceived to be unfairly distributed Risks perceived to be natural are more accepted than risks perceived to be manmade Risks perceived to be statistical are more accepted than risks perceived to be catastrophic Risks perceived to be generated by a trusted source are more accepted than risks perceived to be generated by an untrusted source Risks perceived to be familiar are more accepted than risks perceived to be exotic Risks perceived to affect adults are more accepted than risks perceived to affect children CONTENTS Table of Contents Interacting with the Community Chess et al 1988 Recognize the importance of community input Citizen involvement is important because a people are entitled to make decisions about issues that directly affect their lives b input from the community can help the agency make better decisions c involvement in the process leads to greater understanding of and more appropriate reaction to a particular risk d those who are affected by a problem bring different variables to the problem solving equation and e cooperation increases credibility Finally battles that erode public confidence and agency resources are more likely when community input isn t sought or considered To the extent possible involve the community in the decision making process Involve the community at the earliest stage possible Clarify the public s role from the outset Acknowledge situations where the agency can give the community only limited power in decision making Find out from the communities what type of involvement they prefer Identify and respond to the needs of different audiences Try to identify the various interests in a situation at the beginning and meet with representatives of each informally Recognize the strengths and weaknesses of citizen advisory groups Deal with everybody equally and fairly When appropriate develop alternatives to public hearings In particular hold smaller more informal meetings If you cannot avoid a large public meeting the logistics should enable both the agency and the community to be treated fairly Consider breaking larger groups into smaller ones Be clear about the goals for the meeting If you cannot adequately fulfill a citizen s request for a meeting propose alternatives In certain situations one to one communication may work best Recognize that people s values and feelings are a legitimate aspect of environmental health issues and that such concerns may convey valuable information Provide a forum for people to air their feelings Listen to people when they express their values and feelings Acknowledge people s feelings about an issue When people are speaking emotionally respond to their emotions Do not merely follow with data Show respect by developing a system to respond promptly to calls from community residents Recognize and be honest about the values incorporated in agency decisions Be aware of your own values and feelings about an issue and how they affect you

Covello 1989 In explaining risk data you may wish to compare a risk number to another number Remember Comparisons can help put risk in perspective Benefits should not be used to justify risks Irrelevant or misleading comparisons can harm trust and credibility Guidelines for Risk Comparisons First rank most acceptable of the same risk at two different times with a standard with different estimates of the same risk Second rank less desirable of the risk of doing something versus not doing it of alternative solutions to the same problem with the same risk experienced in other places Third rank even less desirable of average risk with peak risk at a particular time or location of the risk from one course of an adverse effect with the risk from all sources of the same effect Fourth rank marginally acceptable with cost or one cost risk ratio with another of risk with benefit of occupational risk with environmental risk with other risks from the same source with other specific causes of the same disease illness or injury Fifth rank rarely acceptable use with extreme caution of unrelated risks e g smoking driving a car lightning Remember the factors that people use in their perception of risk the more a comparison disregards these factors the more ineffective the comparison CONTENTS Table of Contents A Presentation Planner Project Time Place Date Publics Names Concerns
