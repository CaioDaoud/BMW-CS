CHIEF INFORMATION OFFICER TABLE OF CONTENTS Introduction 3 Current Business Environment 4 Vision 5 Mission 5 Opportunities and Challenges 6 Goals and Objectives 9 OFFICE OF THE CHIEF INFORMATION OFFICER INTRODUCTION Secretary s Memorandum 1030 30 pursuant to the Clinger Cohen Act of 1996 established the Office of the Chief Information Officer OCIO OCIO has primary responsibility for supervision and coordination within the U S Department of Agriculture USDA of the design acquisition maintenance use and disposal of IT by USDA agencies The mission of the OCIO is to strategically acquire and use information and technology resources to improve the quality timeliness and cost effectiveness of USDA service delivery to its customers The USDA has identified five Departmental priorities Expand economic and trade opportunities for U S agricultural producers Promote health by providing access to a safe affordable and nutritious food supply Maintain and enhance the Nation s natural resources and environment Enhance the capacity of all rural residents communities and businesses to prosper Operate an efficient effective discrimination free organization The Office of the Chief Information Officer in concert with USDA agencies must use information as a strategic resource to help accomplish these priorities The Information Technology Management and Reform Act ITMRA of 1996 also known as the Clinger Cohen Act Division E of Public Law 104 106 established new information management requirements including the implementation of IT Architecture Cyber Security management and oversight and of a Capital Planning and Investment Control process To meet the requirements of ITMRA and to provide a Departmental focus on IRM issues the OCIO provides Department wide policy guidance leadership coordination and direction to the Department s information management and IT investment activities in support of USDA program delivery In addition OCIO has responsibility for the operational activity for the Department s National Information Technology Center NITC in Kansas City NITC environment is national in scope and importance and its mission is clearly connected to the success of its customers to enable government agencies to achieve their missions by providing innovative cost effective and secure IT solutions OCIO is working to ensure that USDA recruits and retains a skilled workforce and in compliance with Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act is providing leadership to develop a corporate IT accessibility strategy to ensure accessibility to people with disabilities including employees and members of the public The OCIO works in partnership with the Federal CIO Council the USDA Executive IT Investment Review Board EITRB the USDA IT Leadership group and USDA agency IRM and program managers Other authorizing legislations and authorities for OCIO include Government Paperwork Elimination Act GPEA Public Law 105 277 Title XVII Freedom to E File Act S 777 Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 Public Law 104 13 Government Performance and Results Act of 1993 Public Law 103 62 Computer Security Act of 1987 Public Law 100 235 Office of Management and Budget Circular A 11 Office of Management and Budget Circular A 130 Federal Activities Inventory Reform FAIR Act Federal Managers Financial Integrity Act FMFIA Federal Records Act Federal Acquisition Reform Act of 1995 Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act of 1994 Federal Financial Assistance Management Improvement Act of 1999 Agricultural Risk Protection Act of 2000 The Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act CURRENT USDA BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT Even though the United States economy is enjoying the longest expansion in its history critical challenges continue to face American agriculture rural America and other constituents of the United States Department of Agriculture USDA The Department must effectively manage its information and technology resources in order to meet these challenges Depressed markets and natural disasters have challenged USDA s ability to respond to the needs of farmers In the last few years Congress and the Administration have supplied billions of dollars in emergency assistance for farmers significantly increasing the pressures on declining USDA staff and limited IT resources used to deliver assistance The Department is also faced with enhancing agricultural exports with continuing to improve the crop insurance program which is the centerpiece of the farm safety net and with continuing to improve food safety Even though America s farmers are facing difficulties they continue to produce the most affordable and safest food supply in the world However millions of people still need nutrition assistance through USDA s food stamp program school lunch program and others to take advantage of this supply USDA also remains at the forefront of assisting countries around the world through programs that provide foreign food assistance USDA is challenged with bringing rural Americans the same opportunities for economic growth that exist in urban areas with improving and expanding the conservation programs that preserve our water and our land and through the Forest Service with implementing a natural resources agenda for the 21st century that emphasizes sustainable forest management recreation forest roads and watershed health and restoration The Department s missions include promoting research to develop new technologies that improve the productivity and competitiveness of farmers and creating new and useful products monitoring and reporting on virtually every aspect of the farm and food economy and maintaining the health of our nation s plants and animals Effectively managing information and technology continues to be critical to USDA s ability to meet the programmatic challenges that we face However the rapid pace of technological change especially the emergence of the Internet has increased pressure on USDA to fundamentally change the way we provide services to our customers Customers increasingly expect to conduct business with USDA electronically at a time when it is convenient for them And USDA must move towards e Government while protecting customers privacy and the security of the information and assets that we manage The following sections describe the Office of the Chief Information Officer s vision and mission for using IT to effectively deliver USDA s programs to the American people and sets forth the priorities OCIO must address to meet the challenges ahead VISION STATEMENT The vision of the Office of the Chief Information Office Better government through effective use of information people and technology MISSION STATEMENT The vision of the Office of the Chief Information Office is To strategically acquire and use information and technology resources to improve the quality timeliness and cost effectiveness of USDA service delivery to all its customers KEY EXTERNAL FACTORS There are several external factors that may affect the achievement of OCIO goals and objectives Among these are the following 1 variances in programmatic or legislative mandates brought about by major changes in the quantity type and utilization of information 2 the rapid pace of change in technology and 3 the ability to acquire qualified personnel OPPORTUNITIES AND CHALLENGES The Office of the Chief Information Officer must provide effective leadership to USDA s agencies in the strategic acquisition and use of IT resources in a dynamic and changing IT environment IT is a critical enabler for USDA s seven missions and historically disparate program areas Understanding the opportunities and challenges posed by this environment is essential to framing the strategic focus for OCIO for the next three to five years Opportunities Service Center Management The Secretary has asked the CIO to play a direct role in managing the IT investments in the Department s Service Center Modernization Initiative OCIO s enhanced role in this key Departmental initiative has created the opportunity to forge critical relationships with program managers in the Service Center Agencies while also ensuring that IT investments support reengineered business processes to create a truly one stop shop for USDA s customers Electronic Government Electronic government provides USDA agencies the opportunity to serve customers 24 hours a day seven days a week whenever it is convenient for them The Internet has also created the opportunity for USDA and all Federal agencies to create more efficient integrated and customer friendly business processes to share information easily with all stakeholders and to receive constant feedback from customers about how to improve services while accomplishing more with less Legislation such as the Freedom to E file Act make it clear that constituents expect USDA to act quickly to reengineer its business processes to take full advantage of exciting technological advancements Corporate Management The Clinger Cohen Act the Government Paperwork Elimination Act Freedom to E File Act the Government Performance and Results Act and other legislation make it clear that IT resources are a strategic resource that is central to delivering programs and services OCIO and other Departmental officials must provide the leadership necessary to improve how USDA agencies work together to ensure that we find enterprise wide solutions to common problems reduce redundancies and leverage our resources Intensified government wide focus on sound Capital Planning and Investment Control Processes make it imperative that OCIO continue to improve its leadership in the strategic management of USDA s IT assets Universal Access Changes in the telecommunications industry make reduced unit cost a reality but only if the Department seizes the opportunity to create an universal network The universal network will allow USDA to more efficiently manage its telecommunications assets ensure the capacity necessary to move into E government and enable us to leverage the successes documented by industry partners and take advantage of unit cost reductions Challenges Information Security The increase in computer viruses denial of service attacks hacker attempts as well as potential physical threats make it vital that USDA acts quickly and in a concerted effort to strengthen cyber security OCIO has taken steps in this direction by hiring an expert as the new Associate CIO for Cyber Security His presence has already yielded results in forging a coordinated approach to security issues as well as ensuring agency compliance with security policies However much more remains to be done to ensure that USDA s financial assets program resources and personal information about customers and employees are secure Constrained Budgets In many cases OCIO as well as USDA agencies continue to receive less budgetary resources than required to fully implement the initiatives necessary to achieve our objectives The Service Center Modernization Initiative continues to suffer from insufficient resources OCIO has not yet received full funding for critical security or electronic government initiatives including cross agency initiatives that are critical to ensure seamless access to governmental services by citizens Funding is also required to support the enterprise network and to ensure the necessary bandwidth is available to support E government Fully achieving OCIO s strategic plan and meeting our objectives will be difficult if these budgetary issues are not resolved Electronic Government With few exceptions USDA has not fully realized the potential of the Internet to change the way it delivers programs and services and communicates with customers other constituencies or internally As the Internet rapidly transforms the private sector citizens increasingly are demanding the same kind of efficient integrated and seamless services form government To respond government agencies must understand their customers needs and organize their information and even program transactions according to customers interests rather than the interests of existing organizations USDA managers must understand the ramifications of e Government and they must have incentives to work together and provide customers the kinds of services they deserve IT Staffing Shortage OCIO like all Federal agencies continues to face the challenge of finding training and retaining skilled IT employees Government pay scales are significantly lower than those in the private sector making it more difficult for government agencies to compete for talented IT employees OCIO must continue to support government wide solutions to the IT labor shortage while working to ensure that OCIO becomes an ever more attractive organization for IT employees to work USDA Culture USDA has seven program mission areas and includes some 29 separate agencies and staff offices with different structures and cultures The Department has some 15 000 offices spread across the United States and worldwide USDA s history and culture is such that agencies do not automatically think of USDA as a corporate entity rather each agency values its autonomy and ability to make decisions it believes are in the best interests of its specific customers not necessarily considering how such decisions relate to USDA as a whole This is the case even where customers are essentially the same OCIO in cooperation with the Secretary sub cabinet and other Departmental officials must provide the leadership and incentives to forge the necessary combination of centralized and decentralized authority to ensure that IT resources are efficiently managed and that USDA s customers receive the integrated services they deserve Multifaceted IT Architectures USDA agencies deploy a wide range of IT resources and technologies creating a complex infrastructure of hardware software telecommunications and other resources Disparate human resources property management procurement and other systems proliferate across the Department making it difficult to achieve the benefits of standardized IT architectures telecommunications or policies However the trend is increasing towards finding common approaches to common problems Forging appropriate standards while effectively managing these assets requires cross agency communication and focused leadership to ensure that individual agency decisions consider the impact on the whole best practices are shared and where it is appropriate resources are leveraged Goal 1 Enhance Customer Service and Operational Support We must make our commitment to customers highly visible through an aggressive approach to problem resolution improved technical communications a centralized help desk customer service center and the development of good customer service skills Those capabilities must be possessed by all staff including clerical administrative and operations personnel Commitment to customer satisfaction makes it imperative that we fully understand the missions and goals of our customers so that we can satisfy their requirements both current and future We must deliver just in time services to our customers and provide the leadership necessary to help them make sound information technology investments Objective 1 1 Be a leading Innovative Information Technology Organization Experienced in Providing Quality and Cost Effective Services The mission of the National Information Technology Center NITC is to provide reliable and cost effective information technology solutions to achieve effective mission performance and program delivery for the USDA its agencies

Maintain an infrastructure to ensure maximum availability reliability and performance Develop strategy implement and market a service which will enable NITC customers to access NITC computing platform via a Web interface Improve the process by which NITC business needs are identified and then met by managing staffing levels and enhancing skill sets Human Capital Information and other Resource Needs Achievement of this objective requires additional staff It also requires strong partnership with USDA agencies and a high level of management commitment resources and time to implement Objective 1 2 Enhance Telecommunications Service Delivery Consistent with recent legislation and new ways of doing business USDA is moving toward electronic delivery of services To achieve electronic delivery goals USDA must have a well managed reliable secure and adaptable telecommunications infrastructure In addition to meeting legislative mandates management of this infrastructure requires dealing effectively with the ongoing transformation of the telecommunications industry developing sound acquisition strategies buying wisely monitoring performance of the network and management structure reviewing and assessing compliance with established policies and taking corrective action when needed OCIO will also continue to address critical weaknesses in USDA telecommunications management identified by the General Accounting Office A key component of the strengthened management structure is the proposed implementation of the USDA Universal Telecommunications Network UTN which will improve connectivity for USDA customers partners and agencies to efficiently and effectively move information The UTN will be comprised of a common network backbone linking critical population centers and utilizing multiple Internet access points The UTN will be managed and supported through a centralized Network Management and Coordination Center NMCC Key Outcome Measures Transition USDA Agencies FTS2000 long

Responsive service delivery is dependent on the leadership security quality and operation of the telecommunications infrastructure Additional funding for contractor support will also be needed for all aspects of designing implementing and managing the universal network Goal 2 Improve and Enhance the Information technology Capital Investments Process and The Skills of The Information Technology Workforce Ensuring that IT decisions meet core business needs requires the engagement of the USDA community beginning with the most senior program officials OCIO must ensure that Department IT investments deliver a substantial business benefit to agencies and a positive return on the investment for taxpayers Meeting these expectations and legislative mandates requires the establishment of an effective and efficient capital planning and investment control process sound integrated information technology architecture and a skilled workforce for continued program delivery Objective 2 1 Ensure IT Investments Are Managed and Deployed Effectively Working with USDA program and IT staffs OCIO has made great progress in implementing a Capital Planning and Investment Control CPIC process The CPIC Program established a Departmental process for selecting managing and evaluating the results of all major investments in information technology This process is based on applicable General Accounting Office and Office of Management and Budget OMB guidance The selection process incorporates OMB s Raines Rules which guides agencies to assess investments based on their ability to meet mission needs their cost benefit return profile and the risks on the investment The Department has been a leader in the development and use of the Information Technology Investment Portfolio System I TIPS which was jointly developed by USDA and the Department of Energy USDA is now using I TIPS to manage information about its entire IT investment portfolio This system supports USDA s implementation of the CPIC process In order to continue to improve our performance in Capital Planning and thereby ensure that we make the best investment choices and manage our investments to successful implementation we must improve the quality and the consistency of capital planning across USDA Further we must develop and implement tools to support the disciplines of CPIC Return on Investment risk assessment and performance measurement Finally we must train OCIO and agency staffs to ensure tools are applied properly and investments are managed well Key Outcome Measures Enhance the CPIC process by increasing use of USDA s I TIPS to track agency IT investments benefits risk assessments and evaluations for all major and significant USDA IT investments OCIO uses the annual budget process to review agency IT portfolios to determine how well or how poorly agencies have adopted the CPIC for their own use OCIO will use the information entered by the agencies into I TIPS to determine the degree to which they have utilized CPIC methods and tools to select control and evaluate their IT investments Through these methods OCIO will be able to make a qualitative determination about the agencies use of CPIC Baseline Currently only basic budget and descriptive information for most investments in the major and significant categories In addition to this information OCIO will work with the agencies to ensure that the following documents are available through I TIPS benefit cost analyses risk assessment project milestones technical documentation and waivers The data currently stored in I TIPS represents about 10 of the total investment documentation Target 100 of USDA major and significant systems will utilize the full range of CPIC tools and methods by 2005 and will store these documents in I TIPS Long Term Strategies Improve the quality and the consistency of capital planning across USDA Assist agencies in the refinement of their planning process for making IT investment decisions based on departmental business needs Improve the quality and consistency of risk and return on investment ROI analyses performed by USDA agencies Assist agencies in increasing the completion

needed for contract support Goal 4 Develop Implement and Maintain a Secure and Confidential IT Environment While Protecting Privacy Protection of information assets and maintaining the availability integrity and confidentiality of USDA IT systems and telecommunications resources are vital in meeting USDA s program delivery requirements Information security has emerged as a top priority for the Department As technology has enhanced the ability to share information instantaneously between computers and networks it has also made USDA organizations more vulnerable to unlawful and destructive penetration and disruptions USDA s mandate for securing its information systems arises from the Computer Security Act of 1987 This law and guidance from the Office of Management and Budget provide the department with the basic security requirements In addition on May 22 1998 Presidential Decision Directive 63 PDD 63 explaining key elements of the Clinton Administration s policy on critical infrastructure protection was released It calls for a national effort to assure the security of the United States increasingly vulnerable and interconnected infrastructure particularly its cyber systems These requirements along with his own concerns have led the Secretary to direct the Office of the Chief Information Officer OCIO to develop a strategy to improve USDA s cyber security OCIO s Action Plan to Strengthen USDA Information Security completed in August of 1999 lays out a comprehensive and multi faceted approach necessary to ensure that the risks to the Department s information assets are identified and minimized Objective 4 1 Ensure USDA Agencies Have Identified Security Vulnerabilities and Implemented Strategies To Mitigate Them Comprehensive and thorough security threat assessments of USDA s information assets must become an integral part of IT management within the Department OCIO will begin a campaign to institutionalize IT risk management as a standard component of USDA s technology investment and management strategy Key Outcome Measures Provide policy guidance and training to strengthen USDA information security to all USDA agencies Evaluate all mission critical information systems and identify all vulnerabilities Develop mitigation plans for vulnerabilities discovered through formal threat assessments Baseline Currently threat assessments have been conducted on only a few of USDA s critical information systems Furthermore these assessments are not standard nor comprehensive Target All USDA critical information systems will be evaluated for
