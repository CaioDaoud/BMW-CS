tmdb dscm dsc 01 htm 2 the design search code and tmdb dscm dsc ai htm 3 an alphabetical index The General Guidelines provide broad instructions and procedures for interpreting the design search code The design search code is a numerical classification index which codifies design figurative elements into categories the most general classification divisions subsets of categories and sections subsets of divisions The design search code is the equivalent of a filing system for paper records such as the system in use in the Trademark Search Room Each design element in a specific section is assigned a six digit number The first two numbers which may range from 0129 indicate the category the second group of two digit numbers which may be any odd number between 0125 indicates the division and the third group of two digit numbers which may range from 0133 indicates the section For example category 01 represents celestial bodies natural phenomena and geographical maps Division 01 in category 01 tmdb dscm dsc 01 htm 0101 01 01 represents stars Section 03 in division 01 in category 01 tmdb dscm dsc 01 htm 010103 01 01 03 represents five pointed stars The design code also contains explanatory notes such as specific guidelines which provide instructions for specific code sections cross reference notes which direct users to other code categories sections and divisions and notes describing elements which are included or excluded from a code section The alphabetical index is a list of design elements with their corresponding numeric code If the specific item you are looking for is not listed a synonym or related item will direct you to the appropriate code CODING DESIGN MARKS The individuals coding design trademarks have been instructed to look at the designs from two aspects First the coder should look at the mark as if he were going to search that particular mark The coder should identify the significant design elements and assign the appropriate codes Second the coder should look at the subject mark and think if I was searching for another mark what elements in the subject mark would be considered significant Those elements should be coded Although the first and second perspective will often coincide there are many instances where the second perspective will dictate more comprehensive coding The tmdb dscm dsc gl htm General Guidelines provide an overview for coding USING THE DESIGN CODE In conducting a design search one may focus on an extremely narrow group of similar design marks by using one or more six digit codes One may also look at broader categories or divisions of marks by using either two digit or four digit codes Typically one will restrict either broad or narrow groupings of design marks by limiting the search to one or more classes of goods and services For example the mark illustrated below is used to identify electrically heated utensils namely skillets coffee percolators and serving trays in International Class 11 and U S Class 21 Please note non electric coffee percolators are classified in International Class 21 and U S Classes 2 and 13 Skillets are related to pans and pans may be found in International Class 21 and U S Classes 13 and 33 Sample trademark with design as described above The design elements of the mark consist of the silhouette of a colonial man s head The circle serves as a carrier or border for the significant elements and may be ignored in this particular instance The following codes are relevant for conducting a search 02 01 01 Heads portraiture busts of men 02 01 02 Shadows or silhouettes of men 02 01 06 Colonial men A narrow search could be constructed by requesting the head or silhouette of a colonial man in International Classes 11 and 21 or U S Classes 13 and 33 Search

marks retrieved the user can remove the class limits and continue the search Search for a DESIGN MARK tmdb dscm dsc 02 htm 020101 02010 DC OR tmdb dscm dsc 02 htm 020101 020101 DC AND tmdb dscm dsc 02 htm 020106 020106 DC NOT S1 In the second search statement S1 stands for the first search statement By using the Boolean NOT operator the user will not retrieve the documents retrieved in the first search statement After reviewing the marks retrieved the user may need to continue the search by looking for the heads of men silhouettes of men or colonial men in the appropriate classes Search for a
