The Plasma Universe The Plasma Universe Plasmas the 4th state of matter no we are not talking about blood are the dominant form of matter in the universe As material is heated from solid to liquid to gas phase and then even hotter it begins to become ionized that is one or more of the electrons on an atom become liberated A plasma can be described as a collection of ionized particles which interact collectively by long range electromagnetic forces associated with their charges and motion When the inter particle binding energy is small compared to the average kinetic energy of the particles then a plasma exhibits its most complex collective behaviors Fortunately for human beings and other living things plasmas are not routinely encountered on the surface of the Earth However we do see natural plasmas in the form of lightning and auroras and man made ones most commonly in the form of fluorescent light bulbs A little farther away from home the Earth s magnetosphere contains a plasma which is populated by particles of the solar wind interacting with ones from the Earth s upper atmosphere The solar corona is a good example of a hot plasma Each planet with a magnetic field tends to have its own plasma such as around Jupiter or even the moon Io As comets come into the inner solar system a plasma tail often develops in addition to non charged dusty tail and was easily visible on the recent Hyakutake and Hale Bopp comets for example Beyond the solar system in interstellar space ions and electrons at very low densities are found everywhere Beautiful plasma nebula can be photographed from earth excited by light from nearby stars Generally every energetic object in the universe has a plasma associated with it We can detect plasmas by observing their electromagnetic radiation light x rays radio waves etc or in some cases by observing the interaction of their ions and electrons with other objects Comet Hyakutake with bluish plasma tail Lightning produces a plasma too At Los Alamos we study plasmas of all kinds and seek to harness them for controlled thermonuclear energy production for use in the processing of materials for environmental restoration and decontamination to understand the physics of high energy density states of matter and in various astrophysical contexts A good article on plasmas by Jim Glanz is http w3fusion ph utexas edu aps plasmaState PPSPage3 html here http www p24 lanl gov P 24 Plasma Physics Group Home Page http www lanl gov physics Physics Division at LANL Home Page http fusionenergy lanl gov Magnetic Fusion Programs at LANL Home Page http wsx lanl gov P 24 Magnetic Fusion Energy Team Home Page http public lanl gov alp plasma TheUniverse html The Universe L O S A L A M O S N A T I O N A L L A B O R A T O R Y Operated by the University of California for the U S Department of Energy Visitor Hit Counter since Jan 25 2000 Last modified November 02 2002 http www lanl gov Misc copyright html Copyright 2001 UC http www lanl gov Misc disclaimer html Disclaimer PrivacyPolicy Glen Wurden mailto wurden lanl gov wurden lanl gov P 24 Plasma Physics Group MS E526 Los Alamos National Laboratory Los Alamos NM 87545
