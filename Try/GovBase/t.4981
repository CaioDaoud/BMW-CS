html A Historic Meeting at the White House on Human Spaceflight involving PresidentKennedy and NASA Administrator James Webb on November 20 1962 This meeting with a number of other high level participants was prompted in partby press reports that NASA was not devoting enough attention to theApollolunar landing program and the possible requirement for an additional supplementalappropriation of over 400 million to NASA s current budget This meetingis a window into the role that human spaceflight played in internationaland domestic politics in the early 1960s It also provides insights intothe thinking of high level government officials about spaceflight theirpersonal interactions and the cooperation and conflict of their organizations The meeting was tape recorded but the recording was not released untilAugust 2001 It is of relatively high quality when compared to other presidentialrecordings from the era but it is still rather difficult to discern andunderstand the various voices This Web site includes the full audio transcriptin streaming format the written transcript and other supporting information Special thanks to Dwayne A Day Glen Swanson Douglas Ortiz and Sivram
