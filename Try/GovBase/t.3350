something is to do it We think the best way to learn about what an astrophysicist does would be to spend a day or two or three in the shoes of one But since we don t have room for everyone who visits our web site to visit our lab we ve tried to do the next best thing In these web pages you will be given a real problem in docs dict ad html astronomy astronomy which you solve by traveling through web pages exploring different options and learning many different things along the way Science is a process of inquiry Scientists propose hypotheses and test them with experiments In these pages you will begin with several options for experiments that may lead to the answer you are seeking Scientists go down many paths that turn out to be dead ends In these pages you will encounter some dead ends too But often a scientist learns much from a dead end You will find that is true here as well As you travel through the pages in the site to answer the question you are given you will have the chance to read about relevant concepts in astronomy and test your skills with interactive quizzes You should take the time to take the interactive quizzes For each one that you successfully complete you will be given a record at the end of skills and concepts you have learned You will have the opportunity to take different paths and to try different techniques Different paths are indicated by buttons as well as descriptions Some buttons you will encounter and what you will find there include Info To get more information Experiment To choose an experiment Tools To use calculations and tools Data To look at some data Quiz To take a quiz Important When you encounter a quiz to test what you have learned always press the check me button to check your answer and proceed rather than pressing the return button By taking the quizzes you will generate a list of concepts you have learned by exploring these problems Teachers If you like you can ask students to print out the final page which contains a list of new skills or concepts the student has mastered in his or her journey Many of these skills correspond in some way to National Science or Math standards Thus these printouts can be used as an assessment tool for this activity As always we appreciate your comments about these projects Now you can choose an astronomy question to solve from the list below cyg X1 mass intro html
