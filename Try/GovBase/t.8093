Additional Information digital Products available in digital format http www nws noaa gov disclaimer1 html NWS Official Web Disclaimer Analysis and forecast products are available on the MMAB web pages for ocean winds both from analysis and satellite sensing ocean waves ocean fog both coastal and open ocean vessel icing and sea ice The products are at different levels of completeness or support with operational operational being the most supported experimental experimental being intermediate and developmental developmental the lowest Developmental products are available only to people involved in product evaluation Experimental products will replace the current operational products once they ve been proven to be superior You can reach the products by selecting the name which will take you to the appropriate page The page will also describe the products and their use as well as including links to the images EXPERIMENTAL Marine Summary Map Marine Summary Figure We produce a summary figure for northern hemisphere marine hazards This summary is intended to be for 00 Z of the current day north gif Click here for a north polar view of the same information south gif Click here for a south polar view of limited hazard information please note that the southern hemisphere cannot include vessel icing or fog hazards due to the absence of model guidance Waves and ice however are still included The valid date is given on the figure Hazards currently included are waves Welcome html Waves greater than 5 meter significant wave height Red Red Sample vessel icing Welcome html Vessel Icing Dark Blue Dark Blue Sample fog Welcome html Fog Visibility less than 3 nautical miles 5 6 km Aqua Aqua Sample seaice Analyses html Sea ice Purple Purple Sample waves Welcome html Waves greater than 2 5 meter 8 ft significant wave height Pale Red Pale Red Sample Clicking on the name of a hazard in the above list will take you to the branch page which deals with that item in detail Please note that only one hazard is marked on the figure If two hazards are present the one highest on the list is shown Only very high waves greater than 5 m are shown in an area for example even if there is also fog or vessel icing Vessel icing is shown rather than fog As this is an experimental product we are particularly interested in your comments on how to make it more useful Please write
