NASA s twin Mars Exploration Rovers undergo a remarkable journey to the Red Planet aerospace experts at Ames Research Center are using the hyperwall a unique visualization tool developed in the NASA Advanced Supercomputing NAS Division to study the aerodynamics of a future Mars spacecraft Together with powerful custom built software the hyperwall s seven by seven array of flat panel screens each harnessed to its own powerful computer allows NASA scientists like Michael Aftosmis and Marian Nemec to examine thousands of multi parameter simulations and instantly study behavior patterns in the data Aftosmis and Nemec computational fluid dynamics CFD specialists recently ran 4 700 CFD simulations to study the preliminary aerodynamics of a Mars flyer design in a variety of flight conditions and control surface settings Up until now CFD simulations have been used to look at a particular set of conditions and it s been hard to understand trends said Aftosmis The hyperwall is a key tool the only way to obtain insight and understanding of trends and behavior patterns Up until now CFD simulations have been used to look at a particular set of conditions and it s been hard to understand trends said Aftosmis The hyperwall is a key tool the only way to obtain insight and understanding of trends and behavior patterns Normally you simulate the flow over a spacecraft and you see what it s doing and why explains Aftosmis What you don t see is that if conditions were only slightly different performance may be completely different The hyperwall shows us that Brainchild of NAS senior scientist Chris Henze the hyperwall allows researchers to use different tools viewpoints and parameters to display the same data or datasets Each of the 49 computers can display process and share data so a single image can be displayed across all screens similar to the less versatile powerwall systems or endless configurations of data can be displayed in selected cells like a giant spreadsheet We ve used an application driven approach for the development of the hyperwall and have had several very productive collaborations with scientists in a number of disciplines said Henze One unexpected benefit is that it has proved to be a great collaborative environment Groups have access to the display so people can get up and point at things or shout things out It s been a great brainstorming catalyst Additional projects that have benefited from the hyperwall s powerful versatility include studies of galaxy clustering simulated carbon nanotube experiments and satellite imaging of the Earth

proposal to help the Lakota tribe manage land use issues by means of NASA s Information Power Grid IPG resources and Earth science data has been awarded funding through a NASA cooperative agreement The proposal calls for a joint collaboration with NASA s IPG team Sinte Gleska University a tribal university on the Rosebud reservation in South Dakota Earth Sat Global Science Technology Inc and the Earth Resources Observing Systems EROS Data Center a field center for the U S Geological Survey s National Mapping Division The proposed work will receive funding to use Earth science data provided by EROS on the Rosebud reservation Comprised of 890 000 acres the reservation is particularly difficult to oversee without the use of planes to conduct aerial surveys an expense the tribe cannot afford In addition to assisting with land management the data will be used to track tribal history Ancestors of the Lakota people were buffalo hunters and examining data provided by EROS may shed light on previous buffalo migration patterns IPG resources will be used to help collect transport and process all the Earth science data across multiple locations The grid will serve as the underpinnings for all of the distributed systems required for this work All of the infrastructure required is on the grid and we the IPG team will provide the support needed explained Tom Hinke senior scientist and IPG team member in the NASA Advanced Supercomputing NAS Division at Ames Research Center Sinte Gleska University hopes this effort will spark economic growth on the reservation which currently has an unemployment rate of more than 80 percent If successful this method may also be used to help other tribes with large land holdings manage their reservations Proposals were solicited by NASA s Office of Earth Science which is responsible for ensuring that data technology and capabilities acquired and developed by NASA are exploited to the maximum extent possible for the benefit of society and the economy of the nation To help meet this objective the Office of Earth Science explores solutions that utilize these resources to help better understand and predict Earth s changes The projects funded under this program will join ongoing NASA data and information projects to form the NASA Earth Science Research Education and Applications Solution Network Earth Science REASoN For more information

HiMAP High fidelity Multidisciplinary Analysis Process has been successfully applied to a joint project with the U S Navy to understand certain phenomena involved in Abrupt Wing Stall AWS on its F 18 E F Aircraft The project Computational Prediction of Abrupt Wing Stall AWS on the F 18 E F Aircraft was sponsored by the Office of Naval Research and monitored by the Naval Air Warfare Center in Maryland NASA Ames was chosen as the lead center to do the CFD calculations explains NAS senior scientist and HiMAP developer Guru Guruswamy We used HiMAP because of its unique ability as a multidiscipline software to solve fluids structures and controls and because it works on multilevel parallel systems The HiMAP computations were conducted on Lomax an SGI Origin 3000 supercomputer in collaboration with the Naval Postgraduate School NPS in Monterey and involved 17 million grid points and 104 processors One of the most important observations made from the computations involved the effect of area rule on aircraft lift in certain configurations The area rule applies to the wave drag of an aircraft I am very pleased to acknowledge the outstanding cooperation expertise and support Guru Guruswamy and David Rodriguez contributed to this project said the project s principle investigator Max Platzer of the NPS It showed that area ruling can have a significant effect on the development of AWS in the transonic flight regime The AWS project concluded at the end of 2002 HiMAP was developed under NASA s High Performance Computing and Communication Project and efficiently integrates software analysis tools to solve large scale multidisciplinary problems on massively parallel supercomputers The technology can also be applied in other fields such as automotive mechanical civil and bio engineering HiMAP has been successfully used on NASA s High Speed Civil Transport Project NASA s Advanced Subsonic Transport project and DARPA s Unmanned Combat Air Vehicle Project In 2002 the NAS team led by Guruswamy received the 2002 NASA Space Act Software Release award for their development of HiMAP For more information on HiMAP contact Guru Guruswamy at mailto Guru P

common theme of many of presentations delivered at the workshop was data accessibility or Data Grids Data Grids involve managing replicating sharing and preserving data The prevalence of this theme shows the evolving maturity of Grid computing where emphasis has shifted from simply providing access to distributed resources to making massive datasets available for scientific analysis via Grid resources The idea is to make data and data analysis tools accessible from anywhere on Earth and eventually in space using a single secure log in feature from a Web interface The IPG tutorial and workshop held in Palo Alto Calif began with an address from Walt Brooks acting chief of the NAS Division Although the IPG is not available to NASA researchers as a totally functioning capability today we re on the right track to bring this enabling technology to full maturity As the agency explores our solar system picture what a grid enabled NASA could do for future air and spacecraft design astrobiology and a whole host of other scientific disciplines The IPG can help NASA fulfill this need Brooks said Among workshop presenters were representatives of IPG collaborators from Argonne National Laboratory ANL in Illinois and the Information Sciences Institute ISI at the University of Southern California Considered by many to be the originators of Globus based grid computing ANL s Ian Foster and ISI s Carl Kessleman discussed their views on how grid development should evolve Foster outlined his organization s role in the IPG effort We deliver grid technology to the IPG making sure incoming technology is compatible with NASA s grid infrastructure One of our challenges is moving forward with technology while maintaining compatibility with IPG s existing framework he said Kessleman spoke about how his organization supports NASA s IPG effort Our first priority is to understand requirements and how they address NASA and IPG missions Understanding these requirements helps us understand how grids are being used and their future direction Emphasizing the importance of maintaining relevance of the grid to NASA missions NASA s Computing Networking and Information Systems CNIS Project Manager Jerry Yan said Our goal is to do research We should constantly be looking to fill the technology gaps between where NASA is and where NASA wants to go We want to see automation and data readily accessible to scientists that s the resource we want to provide to NASA and the scientific community The CNIS Project is one of the IPG s major funding sources In the coming year IPG team members and collaborators will work to transition the IPG to a higher level of maturity Using their own applications users will test drive the IPG s new capabilities centered on the availability of large datasets and more efficient Web based services We need to develop a higher level grid middleware that includes standardized services to science portals and applications for managing massive datasets says IPG Project Manager Bill Johnston We re seeing an evolution toward a more service oriented environment Other IPG collaborators represented at the workshop included San Diego Supercomputing Center the University of Wisconsin and the University of Texas at Austin Partners at NASA s Glenn Goddard and Langley Research Centers and the Jet Propulsion Laboratory also participated The Information Power Grid is NASA s version of a heterogeneous distributed resource and data sharing environment The mission of NASA s IPG is to develop grid technology and make the agency s distributed computational capabilities massive datasets problem solving environments and scientific tools available to NASA researchers For more information about presentations delivered at

Zheng Ning and Hou Tee Ng of NASA Ames Research Center s Nanotechnology Branch were among the winners of the Ames Director s Discretionary Fund DDF for fiscal year 2003 The grant provides the financial support needed to begin conducting proposed research on Patterned Nanolaser Arrays as Building Blocks for Nano Photonics Systems The proposed nano photonic devices will consume considerably less power perform better and achieve revolutionary functional densities all necessary to withstand extreme conditions in space Nanolasers are the smallest lasers constructed to date with a diameter of just tens of nanometers commonly equated with one thousandth the width of a single human hair The nanolasers we are proposing to simulate and grow could shrink revolutionary information processing and communication capabilities into a nanoscale package for future NASA space missions says Ning Ning and Ng propose to combine computer simulation with experimental growth in order to get the best possible results Drawing on their previous experience with modeling photonic devices see http www nas nasa gov Main Features 2000 Spring VCSEL1 1 html Tiny Lasers Huge Potential the team is confident they can develop a model for patterned nanolaser array structures Extensive computer simulations will be used to determine or design the size and location of each individual laser in the patterned laser array To grow the actual nanotubes and nanowires the team will use a vapor liquid water growth technique modeled after that of a researcher group from the University of California Berkeley This proposed work is important to the future of nano photonic devices because this could be the first time anyone has successfully grown patterned nano laser arrays important for many applications The way nanowires are currently grown results in quality issues there is no way to control where they grow so the end result is random distribution over a two dimensional substrate In addition the nanotubes quickly undergo mechanical deformation not lasting long enough to be useful The Ames Director s Discretionary Fund was established to fund innovative research ideas not currently funded by existing research activities Funding is allocated to selected projects for up to two years By the end of 2004 Ning and Ng hope to have completed a computer simulation code for nano laser array design and prototype patterned nano laser arrays For more information about this work contact Cun Zheng Ning at mailto cning mail arc nasa gov cning mail arc nasa gov Find a complete list of news items for the
