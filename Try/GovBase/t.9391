USGS Scientists and Students Band Floodplain Forest Birds USGS Hosts Third Annual Environmental Explorers Program for Youth Students will grab their binoculars and hip boots to learn more about science and nature through the Environmental Explorers program at the USGS Upper Midwest Environmental Sciences Center June 17 and 18 The program provides an opportunity to explore science hands on for 36 students in grades 4 6 from Wisconsin and Minnesota One third of the students received scholarships to attend the program The young scientists will dig in the Mississippi River for critters collect prairie wildflowers handle amphibians develop maps using geographic software learn about recycling track wild animals and play environmental games The program is a partnership between USGS and the University of Wisconsin La Crosse Continuing Education and Extension Office staff bios rkh0 html Randy Hines La Crosse WI 608 781 6398 randy hines usgs gov USGS Scientists Expertise Sought for Television Documentary Dan Eatherley international film producer from England visited the USGS Upper Midwest Environmental Sciences Center UMESC on June 13 Eartherley consulted UMESC scientists about filming animal behavior and natural phenomena for a documentary on the Upper Mississippi River The film inspired by the book The Last River Rat by Kenny Salwey from Alma Wisconsin will be created for the British Broadcasting Corporation s Natural World series and The Discovery Channel UMESC will provide expertise to help locate and film migratory birds paddlefish native mussels mayflies and invasive species like zebra mussels over the next 16 months The film intends to inform educate and entertain viewers about the natural wonders and interactions between animals and humans on the Mississippi the largest North American river and one of the world s most biologically diverse and productive rivers staff bios rkh0 html Randy Hines La Crosse WI 608 781 6398 randy hines usgs gov Wisconsin Representatives Visit USGS Open House Congressman Ron Kind WI and his two sons attended the Young Scientists of the Future Open House at the USGS Upper Midwest Environmental Sciences Center on June 6 Congressman Kind toured the exhibits and spoke with many of the staff learning about the operation of the Center and its current science program Center Director Dr Leslie Holland Bartels gave Congressman Kind a detailed briefing on the Center s proposal to expand office and conference space The cost savings realized by the project would provide more funds to conduct science Matt Nickolay aid to Senator Russell Feingold also attended the open house staff bios dmk0 html David Kennedy La Crosse WI 608 781 6202 david kennedy usgs gov USGS Scientist Presents Keynote on Invasive Fishes Dr Cindy Kolar USGS Upper Midwest Environmental Sciences Center has been invited by the Australian Society of Fish Biology ASFB to present a keynote address at their annual meeting in Wellington New Zealand on June 30 Kolar a research fishery biologist will present Risk assessment and screening of potentially invasive fishes at an invasive species workshop of the meeting Kolar will share her doctoral research on predicting fish invaders in the Great Lakes and will outline methods being considered by the USGS to predict potential fish invaders in the United States Australia and New Zealand have a long history of invasive species such as rabbits cane toads rats and common carp Because these invaders have had devastating effects the ASFB members are highly interested in prediction of potentially invasive aquatic species Cindy Kolar La Crosse WI 608 781 6223 ckolar usgs gov USGS Research Featured on Nationwide Loon Poster USGS biology research on common loon migration was highlighted in the 2003 Loon Appreciation Week poster LoonWatch a program of the Sigurd Olson Environmental Institute of Northland College Ashland Wisconsin distributed 15 000 posters to schools environmental groups and sponsors throughout the United States Upper Midwest Environmental Sciences Center scientists investigated the migratory movements of Midwestern adult and juvenile common loons marked with satellite transmitters The poster summarized USGS work along with other information on the ecology and habitat needs of common loons Resource managers need information on seasonal movement patterns and habitat requirements of common loons during migration to formulate regional and national conservation strategies staff bios kpk0 html Kevin Kenow La Crosse WI 608 781 6278 kevin kenow usgs gov USGS Scientists and Students Band Floodplain Forest Birds Every ten days six students and two instructors from the Longfellow Middle School School on the River rise very early and set up a series of nets so fine they are nearly invisible to the eye These teenagers under the guidance of scientists from the USGS Upper Midwest Environmental Sciences Center are operating a songbird banding station to better understand how well songbirds nesting in local floodplain forests reproduce The students take several measurements from each bird place a tiny metal numbered band on one leg and then release the birds back into the wild Students use these data to construct life history tables for the birds which will be integrated into their school year course work The bird banding project is part of an ongoing partnership between USGS and the School on the River staff bios pjh0 html Pat Heglund La Crosse WI 608 781 6338 pheglund usgs gov Last updated on June 30 2003 umesc contacts html Contact
