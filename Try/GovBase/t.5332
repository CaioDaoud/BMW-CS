Technical Committee L1 GIS Norman Andersen mailto norman c andersen lmco com norman c andersen lmco com Chair INCITS Technical Committee L1 GIS Part 1 Introduction This is the first of four articles describing Geospatial Standards and the standards bodies working on these standards Parts 2 4 TBD will focus on the main organizations dealing with and developing geospatial standards as follows Part 2 International Organization for Standardization ISO Technical Committee TC 211 Geographic information Geomatics Part 3 American National Standards Institute ANSI InterNational Committee for Information Technology Standards INCITS Technical Committee L1 Geographic Information Systems Part 4 Federal Geographic Data Committee FGDC This article will discuss what geospatial standards are and why they matter identify major standards organizations and list the characteristics of successful geospatial standards What are Standards The purpose of geospatial standards is to facilitate data sharing and increase interoperability among automated geospatial information systems http www iso org ISO The International Organization for Standardization defines standards as documented agreements containing technical specifications or other precise criteria to be used consistently as rules guidelines or definitions of characteristics to ensure that materials products procedures and services are fit for their purpose Further standards contribute to making life simpler and to increasing the reliability and effectiveness of the goods and services we use Need for Geospatial Standards in Today s World With Global Positioning System GPS receivers in the hands of the average person there has been an explosion of interest in and utilization of geographic information Use ranges from hand held GPS receivers to automated location based mobile systems in automobiles and emergency vehicles to tracking our complex transportation communications and utilities networks to mapping modeling and simulating the world in all its thematic glory At the same time there has been an exponential increase in the number of public and private decisions involving some form of geographic information It is estimated that 80 of all data has a locational component Linking this data together through relevant geospatial standards should now be considered a priority national goal Geospatial Standards Activities figure1 jpg Figure 1 shows the relationship between the FGDC and principal international and national organizations that are involved in geospatial standardization activities Several Office of Management and the Budget OMB Circulars set policy for Federal use of standards of which OMB Circulars A 16 and A 119 will be discussed http www whitehouse gov omb a016 a016 rev html OMB Circular A 16 affirms and describes the National Spatial Data Infrastructure NSDI as the technology policies standards human resources and related activities necessary to acquire process distribute use maintain and preserve spatial data It establishes the FGDC as the interagency coordinating body for NSDI related activities chaired by the Secretary of the Interior with the Deputy Director for Management Office of Management and Budget OMB as Vice Chair http www whitehouse gov omb circulars a119 a119 html OMB Circular A 119 directs Federal agencies to participate in voluntary consensus standards organizations and use voluntary consensus standards in lieu of government unique standards except where inconsistent with law or otherwise impractical The http www fgdc gov FGDC develops geospatial data standards for the NSDI only when there are no externally developed standards appropriate for Federal use FGDC standards are developed in consultation and cooperation with State local and tribal governments the private sector and academic community and to the extent feasible the international community FGDC standards are intended to be national in scope and go beyond individual agencies and the Federal government enterprise Federal agencies are required to use FGDC standards State and local agencies are not required to use FGDC standards but are encouraged to do so to promote data sharing between different levels of government American National Standards ANS are endorsed by the American National Standards Insitute http www ansi org ANSI and are national in scope These standards are voluntary consensus standards that are developed and supported by standards development organizations accredited by ANSI ANSI has accredited the InterNational Committee for Information Technology Standards http www incits org INCITS to develop standards for Information and Communications Technologies INCITS Technical Committee L1 Geographic Information Systems adopts or adapts information technology standards such as those developed by ISO Technical Committee 211 and develops digital geographic data standards that are relevant to Geographic Information Systems GIS INCITS L1 membership includes the FGDC individual FGDC member agencies academia professional societies software vendors and systems integrators ISO is the primary international standards organization for information technology Organizations gain access to ISO through their national standards body ANSI is the U S member body of ISO http www isotc211 org ISO Technical Committee 211 Geographic information Geomatics aims to establish a structured set of standards for information concerning objects or phenomena that are directly or indirectly associated with a location relative to the Earth Its work will link to appropriate standards for information technology and data where possible and provide a framework for the development of sector specific applications using geographic data INCITS Technical Committee L1 serves as the U S Technical Advisory Group TAG to ISO Technical Committee 211 The OpenGIS Consortium http www opengis org OGC is aimed at growing interoperability for technologies involving spatial information and location through the development of interface specifications While OGC is not accredited by ANSI ANSI s http public ansi org ansionline Documents News 20and 20Publications Brochures national strategy pdf National Standards Strategy for the United States encourages organizations such as OGC to review their objectives to determine where closer interaction with the formal system will help add value to their efforts OGC has submitted several of its interface specifications for inclusion in ISO Technical Committee 211 s program of work OGC is an advisory member of INCITS Technical Committee L1 and has a liaison relationship with ISO Technical 211 Organizations not shown in figure1 jpg Figure 1 that are involved in activities that support geospatial interoperability include the Object Management Group http www omg org OMG for the Unified Modeling Language UML and the http www w3c org World Wide Web Consortium for eXtensible Markup Language XML Characteristics of Geospatial Standards The http www fgdc gov standards refmod97 pdf FGDC Standards Reference Model provides expectations for FGDC standards FGDC standards are Within Scope Geospatial Standards must relate to geospatial data cover appropriate topical areas and standardize either data or processes to advance data sharing and minimize duplication of effort Future Focused They are intended to remove impedance to data sharing They are being developed to promote new and enhanced interaction with existing Governmental and private industry coordinating mechanisms that have interest in the generation collection use and transfer of spatial data Structured These standards need to be developed and presented in a structured manner that will lead to understandability and usability by consumers Therefore these standards provide minimal guidelines for development and documentation of systems Nor do they specify development methodology There are many structured methodologies that can be employed by developers that will lead to complete and understandable solutions Technology Independent These Standards will not constrain technology development They do not limit the use of new and emerging technologies Nor will they be written or implemented in a way that limits any vendor or technology to maximize the use of the use of their own systems Integrated These Standards will be integrated with one another and with related standards This means there will not be overlapping definitions authorities or procedures Standards development will be coordinated to eliminate duplicate efforts and to maximize the efforts of the volunteers contributing to and implementing standards Evolving They will evolve as technology and institutional mandates change The standards will be written to allow for evolution and will accommodate backward compatibility for information gathered under previously known standards There will be known update and maintenance procedures that are timely and responsive to changes The procedures will be documented as a part of FGDC Standards Supportable These Standards must be supportable by the geospatial vendor community They will be developed in a manner that is supportable by known or emerging technology Publicly Available These Standards will have a broadly based public notice of their availability They will not be developed from copyrighted or proprietary standards that would limit the ability of the final standard to be publicly available They will not contain any copyrights or other limitations on their use or reproduction They will be available electronically whenever possible Complete and Consistent These Standards will be complete in terms of the standards components and methodology described in this reference model They will have a consistent form and format ANSI s National Standards Strategy for the United States notes that standards developed through successful standards process have the following characteristics Standards are relevant meeting agreed criteria and satisfying real needs by providing added value Standards are responsive to the real world they use available current technology and do not unnecessarily invalidate existing products or processes Standards are performance based specifying essential characteristics rather than detailed designs ISO Technical Committee 211 standards activities will be discussed in the second part of this four part series FGDC USGS 590 National Center Reston VA 20192 http www fgdc gov publications documents standards geospatial standards part1
