includes a review of resource protection actions education and research programs the program s resource and staffing needs Sanctuary regulations and boundaries Active and informed public participation is a critical element of sanctuary management and plays an important role in the updating of the sanctuary s management plan What is the management plan and why is it being revised Management plans are sanctuary specific documents that guide many functions including describing regulations and boundaries outlining staffing and budget needs setting priorities and performance measures for sanctuary programs and guiding development of future management activities The management plan is a document that serves as a blueprint for management of the Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuary Periodic management plan review is required by Congress for all of the 13 national marine sanctuaries to ensure that sanctuaries continue to best conserve protect and enhance their nationally significant cultural and natural resources The National Marine Sanctuary Program NMS mission is to identify designate and manage areas of the marine environment of special national and in some cases international significance due to their conservation recreational ecological historical research educational or aesthetic qualities To adequately perform this mandate sanctuary management must regularly review and update the management plan These revisions are necessary to reflect and respond to the latest scientific knowledge marine management policies advances in resource management and new threats to the health of sanctuary resources The National Marine Sanctuaries Act NMSA 16 U S C 1431 et seq calls upon each national marine sanctuary to periodically review its management plan Sanctuaries are to engage in management plan review in order to evaluate substantive progress toward implementing the management plan and goals evaluate the effectiveness of site specific management techniques and strategies and determine necessary revisions to the management plan and prioritize management objectives There are additional reasons for revising the original management plan Since the Sanctuary s designation significant advances in science and technology as well as innovations in marine resource management techniques have rendered the original 1983 management plan obsolete Furthermore the original management plan does not contain performance indicators to help evaluate the effectiveness of CINMS or the National Marine Sanctuary Program Beyond these objectives the purpose of developing a new management plan is twofold 1 to inform Sanctuary constituents including the general public about the Sanctuary and the management strategies CINMS has planned over five years and 2 to guide management toward achievement of the Sanctuary s mission to conserve protect and enhance the biodiversity ecological integrity and cultural legacy of marine resources surrounding the Channel Islands for current and future generations What is the process for revising the management plan The management plan revision process began with a series of public scoping meetings that were held in 1999 Since that time much progress has been made through the significant involvement of the pubic and the Sanctuary Advisory Council The management plan revision process history is described in detail process html here When completed the draft management plan will be available for public review Comments will be solicited and a series of public hearings will be held to provide opportunities to learn about the management plan and provide oral comments After the close of the public comment period all comments will be considered necessary changes will be made to the plan and a final management plan will be issued process html Check here for details on the project s current status and future steps in the process What kind of management changes can be expected While many of the Sanctuary s programs and functions will continue to operate in a manner similar to that which is currently provided several new programs will be proposed as well Action plans will describe specific strategies for programs on public awareness and understanding conservation science management of human activities ecosystem management water quality submerged maritime heritage resources and site operations Additionally all Sanctuary programs will be designed to allow for the measurement of performance over time You can also expect some proposed modifications to existing Sanctuary regulations as well as proposed new regulations that will be targeted at providing necessary protection to Sanctuary resources while still allowing multiple human uses to occur A range of regulatory alternatives will be presented and analyzed in the forthcoming Draft Environmental Impact Statement In the future a supplemental public process will consider the need for changing the boundaries of the Sanctuary How will the public be involved Active and informed public participation is a key element of sanctuary management particularly during management plan review The NMSP recognizes the public as a key resource management partner and values their input in helping shape and manage marine sanctuaries For almost 30 years the NMSP has engaged the public in helping create new sanctuaries develop resource protection strategies resolve multi stakeholder issues i e water quality vessel traffic and marine reserves and more recently to review existing management plans Using the lessons learned from these experiences the NMSP will help build community awareness of key issues affecting these sanctuaries and actively engage user and interest groups agencies and the public in an open dialogue about how to best shape the future direction and management of the Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuary The public has had and will continue to have numerous opportunities to participate in the management plan review These opportunities began with scoping meetings and will continue through the development and public review of the draft and final management plans The NMSP will provide ample notice of each comment opportunity and public meeting through local media and this website How can I get involved We encourage you to get involved in the management plan revision process as an informed member of the
