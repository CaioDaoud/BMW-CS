information products disseminated through the Federal Depository Library Program FDLP must be maintained permanently in regional depository libraries and by depository libraries not served by a regional library Since online products are not physically distributed to depository libraries for retention GPO has assumed responsibility for the provision of permanent access to Government information products residing on GPO Access servers GPO s permanent public access commitment is also met by bringing agency disseminated Internet resources under the purview of GPO and incorporating them into a digital archive GPO captures copies of agency electronic information products and creates PURLs so that users will be automatically redirected to the archived products if the information
