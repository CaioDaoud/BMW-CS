Technology Experiment selected The Mars Analog Research and Technology Experiment MARTE a Mars Analog Drilling Project to Search for Subsurface Life on the Rio Tinto has been selected for funding in the first round of the Astrobiology Science and Technology Experiments ASTEP program Planetary scientist Dr Carol Stoker will be the principal investigator of the project which will be funded at a level of 3M over 3 years The project represents a collaboration between NASA Ames Research Center NASA Johnson Space Center and Centro de Astrobiologia Spain Additional participants include researchers from the University of Oklahoma Portland State University and SETI Institute The focus of the project is to perform a field experiment near the source waters of the Rio Tinto a river in southern Spain to simulate a drilling mission to search for subsurface life on Mars The field site was chosen based on the potential to yield new insight into the subsurface biosphere on Earth and represents an important analog environment for searching for life on Mars The project will also demonstrate an important new drilling technology being developed at NASA Johnson Space Center in collaboration with Baker Hughes Corp Additionally the experiment will demonstrate instruments designed to detect extant life on Mars in situ while also characterizing the subsurface biosphere in the Rio Tinto C McKay and D DeVincenzi participate in subglacial lake workshop On October 3 2002 UC Santa Cruz held a workshop to discuss the National Science Foundation s program to explore the numerous subglacial lakes in the antarctic Of particular interest was Lake Vostok the largest of the lakes in the antarctic Planetary scientist Dr Christopher McKay demonstrated how exploring the astrobiology of Lake Vostok would have close parallels with exploring the astrobiology of Europa one of Jupiter s moons Space scientist Dr Donald DeVincenzi showed how planetary protection guidelines for Europa could play a key role in defining non contaminating conditions under which the subglacial lakes can be sampled for biology J Scargle chairs data understanding workshop On October 3 4 2002 Dr Jeffrey

Exobiologists educate graduate students Exobiologists David Des Marais Brad Bebout Kendra Turk and Victoria Orphan participated in team teaching a course entitled Geobiology An Intensive Training Course In A Rapidly Evolving Field The six week course held on Catalina Island July 6 August 16 2002 at the USC Wrigley Marine Science Center was offered by USC Wrigley Institute and sponsored by the Agouron Institute The Ames Exobiology group taught for one week in a classroom laboratory environment and introduced the students to techniques necessary for making measurements of rates of biogeochemical processes in benthic microbial communities These techniques included gas chromatography flow injection analysis microelectrode measurements and fluorescence in situ hybridization C McKay Links Titan s Haze with Winds Dr Christopher McKay of the Planetary Systems Branch and researchers from other institutions have created the first coupled model linking Titan s organic haze with atmospheric winds and with the sunlight that heats the haze According to the group s model sunlight heats the haze that drives the wind which in turn carries the haze The smallest haze particles can be carried from one pole to the other within one Titan season 4 Earth years We found that the main features of Titan s organic haze arise from a strong feedback loop between the haze the sunlight and the wind said McKay This is a critical new factor in understanding Titan With a thick nitrogen dominated atmosphere similar to Earth s scientists hope that new information about Titan s atmosphere can shed light on the chemical processes that may have created life on Earth PDF TitanHaze pdf Read the article featured in Nature http saturn jpl nasa gov cassini english Learn more about the mission to

Association of Geochemistry and the Geochemical Society This honorary title is presented to scientists who have made a major contribution to the field of geochemistry Dr DesMarais will be recognized during an awards ceremony at the Goldschmidt Conferences which will be held in Davos Switzerland on August 18 23 2002 Lance Delzeit reveals groundbreaking inventions Lance Delzeit of the Exobiology Branch has developed a technique that allows for the deposition and patterning of a catalyst onto a surface for the growth of single walled carbon nanotubes This technique uses direct deposition of metal catalyst onto a support surface It has proven to be an effective way of producing single and multi walled carbon nanotubes within a confined area By modifying the formula of the catalyst being deposited the density and type of nanotubes can also be controlled This technique has also proven to be nearly independent of the support material and avoids many of the problems associated with trying to restrain the placement of liquid based catalysts to a limited area Masking techniques are applicable to this process and have been used to show its application in the development of nano devices He has also developed an environmentally compatible method to purify carbon nanotubes of amporphous carbon and metal contamination This cleaning can be done immediately following the growth process or as a post processing procedure The major benefits of this method are that it is environmentally friendly and does not require any special handling equipment or post scrubbing for the exhaust before release into the environment It is also specifically reactive to the amphorous carbon without damaging the carbon nanotubes Canadian meteorite provides insight into evolution The Tagish Lake meteorite fell last year on a frozen lake in Canada and may provide the most pristine material of its kind Analyses by a diverse group of scientists including exobiologist George Cooper have now shown this carbonaceous chondrite to contain a suite of soluble organic compounds 100 parts per million that includes mono and dicarboxylic acids dicarboximides pyridine carboxylic acids a sulfonic acid and both aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons The insoluble carbon exhibits predominately aromatic character deuterium enrichment and fullerenes containing planetary helium and argon The findings provide insight into an outcome of early solar chemical evolution that differs from any seen so far in meteorites PDF tagish pdf Read the article featured in Science magazin PDF 161K Studying Saturn s mysterious rings Planetary scientist Jeff Cuzzi is on a mission to unravel the mysteries of Saturn s rings There have been many theories about the origin of the rings but because they have evolved substantially since their origin nobody has been able to say for sure when or how they originated New data will help solve this 300 year old puzzle NASA s Cassini spacecraft will reach Saturn in 2004 and measure many different aspects of ring structure and composition This could lead to groundbreaking discoveries about the origin of the rings http science nasa gov headlines y2002 12feb rings htm Read more Astrobiologists create chemicals key to life Scientists in the Space Science Division have created amino acids critical for life in an environment that mimics deep space Dr Max Bernstein says This finding may shed light on the origin of life itself The amino acids that were produced in the lab are also similar to those found in carbon rich meteorites According to astrophysicist Jason Dworkin This finding suggests that Earth may have been seeded with amino acids from space in its earliest days These new discoveries increase the odds that life also evolved in places other than Earth
