Lead Deb Agarwal The Pervasive Collaborative Computing Environment PCCE Many of the tools currently available for collaboration focus on heavy weight applications such as videoconferencing tools While these are important for providing telepresence when there is a high level of interaction our experience building sci collab html distributed collaboratories has shown us that there is a more basic need for collaboration tools that support connecting people so that they feel as though they are working together on an ad hoc or continuous basis Tools that support the day to day connectivity and underlying needs of a group of collaborators are important for providing lighter weight less intrusive and more flexible ways to stay in touch and work together Towards this goal we are developing a Pervasive Collaborative Computing Environment PCCE within which participants can rendezvous and interact with each other The PCCE aims to Support continuous or ad hoc collaboration Target daily tasks and base connectivity Be easy to use and install across multiple platforms Leverage off of existing components when possible Use standards based components Leverage off of Grid services e g security

Release downloads and documentation PCCE Project Description The PCCE is a persistent space that supports continuous and ad hoc collaboration It targets daily tasks such as document sharing and provides a base connectivity for communication Documents can be published into the web environment by users or applications and viewed in a browser via WebDAV capabilities Documents for tracking workflow are one example The text based messaging component provides a place to find and interact with other collaborators in a way that is more immediate than email but less intrusive than the telephone The PCCE allows colocated or geographically dispersed collaborators to Find and contact other participants Send instant messages synchronously and asynchronously Hold private and group conversations Participate in multiple conversations simultaneously Share documents and an electronic notebook Track current workflow Dynamically activate application sharing and videoconference sessions as needed A prototype implementation of the PCCE messaging component has been developed and deployed Using the metaphor of venues users can securely exchange text based synchronous messages with groups or individual users on a private invitation only or public basis Anyone who is online can join a public venue which is seen as having an open door Private venues have their doors closed so admission is only granted only to those who have been explicitly invited by someone already in the venue Conversations can be expanded by inviting others and the mode may be changed to private or public by the venue s existing members Venues can be persistent and exist when no one is present or temporary and created on the fly One to one conversations are initiated by creating a temporary venue and inviting someone else Asynchronous communication is supported by allowing users to leave notes for others who are online or offline Presence and awareness information allows users to identify each other discover what venues they are in and determine availability available busy away at home at work mobile or offline The LBNL Secure Messaging tool is providing a prototype implementation environment for investigating a model of security that is based on the concept of http www itg lbl gov Collaboratories Publications WACE IncTrust final 2003 pdf building trust incrementally among users and between users and the environment Based on SSL all messages exchanged over the network are encrypted and users are authenticated and authorized for access To use the system users must be registered with an authorization service and they must log in with either an X 509 certificate or username and password Certificated users are granted extended privileges such as the ability to create accounts for new users Written in Java the interface is cross platform and has been tested on Unix and Windows A screen shot of the graphical user interface is shown below The main window showing presence information is first followed by a conversation venue Figure 1 The PCCE Messaging Interface The PCCE Architecture The current messaging implementation is based on a client server model In order to leverage existing technologies we employ a public domain IRC server IRCD Hybrid to support synchronous conversations which we modified for enhanced security To provide persistence unique userids and permanent venues registration and user authentication and enhanced presence information that is independent of any one chat server we developed a custom PCCE server The PCCE server also supports asynchronous notes Only SSL connections are used for network communication and both servers have their own X 509 certificates that are presented to each other and to clients The LBNLSecureMessaging system architecture is shown in Figure 2 The authentication and authorization AuthN and AuthZ services presence information and asynchronous messaging are components of the PCCE server on the left IRCD on the right supports text based chat messages over the IRC protocol After having registered users login with the PCCE server each time they start the application Then they connect to the IRC server which queries the PCCE server for user authentication and authorization Registration is done through a designated PCCE administrator or by a certificated user who is logged in The registration information is used to verify login information and can be edited by the registrant via the interface The SSL connections are kept open to facilitate messaging and notification Synchronous chat messages go directly to the IRC server which forwards them to targeted recipients over the established connections The PCCE server sends notifications so that users can update their views of the collaboration group as others join change availability status and leave The client is a graphical user interface implemented with Java Swing shown at the bottom as Client GUI The numbered boxes show the message flow over the established SSL network connections Figure 2 PCCE Messaging Components Search the DSD server http www lbl gov LBNL home page http www lbl gov CS
