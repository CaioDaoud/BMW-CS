This map illustrates the track Hurricane Mitch took over the Central American countries Click the map for a larger image Hurricane Mitch struck Central America with such viciousness that it was nearly a week before the magnitude of the disaster began to reach the outside world Hurricane Mitch will be remembered as the most deadly hurricane to strike the Western Hemisphere in the last two centuries Not since the Great Hurricane of 1780 which killed approximately 22 000 people in the eastern Caribbean was there a more deadly hurricane Hurricane Mitch is responsible for over nine thousand deaths predominately from rain induced flooding in portions of Central America mainly in Honduras and Nicaragua This makes Hurricane Mitch one of the deadliest Atlantic tropical cyclones in history ranking only below the 1780 Great Hurricane in the Lesser Antilles and comparable to the Galveston hurricane of 1900 and Hurricane Fifi of 1974 which primarily affected Honduras A brief history of the hurricane On October 21 1998 a tropical depression formed in the southern Caribbean Sea One day later the storm became a tropical storm and was given the name Mitch Tropical Storm Mitch moved very little over the next few days drifting to the northwest and gathering strength A sharp increase in intensity occurred between the afternoon of October 23 and October 26 during which time Tropical Storm Mitch strengthened from a tropical storm with 60 knot winds to a images smalltrcmitch299h jpg Saffir Simpson Category 5 hurricane with winds of 155 knots Countries affected Honduras The entire country was affected The human toll is an estimated 5 000 deaths over 12 000 injuries and over 8 000 missing Critical food medicine and water shortages Hunger and near starvation widespread in many villages Epidemics feared as malaria dengue and cholera make appearance Fever and respiratory illnesses widespread Helicopters required to take supplies to areas cut off by floods but were in short supply Infrastructure devastated images mitchgal1 jpg copyright Washington Post Whole villages washed away Estimated 70 80 percent of transportation infrastructure destroyed The majority of the country s bridges and secondary roads washed away Even airports were under water In outlying areas over 25 small villages in the northern part of the country were swept away At least 70 percent of crops destroyed including 80 percent of the banana crop Crop losses estimated at 900 million Large warehouses and storage rooms for coffee flooded Maize and corn crops devastated The damage by Mitch to Honduran agricultural production will take years for recovery Nicaragua The northwest parts and northern parts of country were most affected An estimated 3 000 people died or are still missing 870 000 people 18 of the total population were affected by the storm Intense near stationary rain bands over western Nicaragua on Thursday and Friday October 29 30 caused tens of inches of rain to fall The crater lake atop the dormant Casita volcano filled and part of the walls collapsed on Friday October 30 causing mud flows that eventually covered an area ten miles long and five miles wide At least four villages were totally buried in the mud that was several feet deep Over 2 000 of the dead were from the areas around the collapsed volcano near Posoltega In many cases survivors had to wait days before the mud had dried enough to walk to rescuers Damage was extensive from flooding in other parts of the country also As late as November 8 over a thousand people were in urgent need of supplies on the Coco River near the border with Honduras Earlier on Thursday November 5 five hundred bodies were found in the same river near the town of Wiwili An additional five hundred unidentified bodies had washed up on the Pacific shore after flood waters had washed their bodies out to sea As with Honduras there were critical food and water shortages in flooded areas Infrastructure in affected regions devastated Several villages buried under mud slides near the Casita Volcano Damage estimates for Nicaragua are at 1 billion Damage considered worse than in the 1972 Managua earthquake Damage to a half million homes and 750 000 people lost their homes or possessions Thirty percent of coffee crop destroyed according to preliminary reports Beans sugar and banana crops devastated El Salvador Western part of country most affected by rain bands spiralling into Mitch from the Pacific Ocean An estimated 374 persons were killed and 55 864 displaced As much as 80 of maize crop lost Coffee plantations and sugar cane crop severely affected Guatemala The estimates of damage include 268 dead 106 600 evacuees and a total of 750 000 people affected Ten U S citizens and one other person killed in plane crash supplying humanitarian aid on Sunday November 1 Extensive damage to coffee and banana plantations http www doi gov U S Department of the Interior http www usgs gov U S
