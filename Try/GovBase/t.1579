Leader res Profiles fahnenstiel html Gary Fahnenstiel This research program focuses primarily on key components of the Great Lakes foodweb and the links between physical chemical and biological processes that impact important processes in ecosystem function Although long term trends in key components are examined life history studies and process research are emphasized so that GLERL s expertise can be applied to problems in a variety of ecosystems that are geographically and biologically diverse Improve our knowledge and understanding of food web processes and dynamics and their relationship to environmental quality and living resources in Great Lakes and coastal marine ecosystems Apply this knowledge better understand the causes effects and solutions to problems such as eutrophication toxic contaminants nonindigenous species invasions habitat modification and climatic variations res Backgrnds edyback html click here for more general background information on GLERL
