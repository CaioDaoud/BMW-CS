Carcinogens The listing of a substance in the Report is descriptive and qualitative in nature and represents an initial step in hazard identification which is generally considered the first step in the analytical process known as risk assessment Risk assessments are not conducted by the National Toxicology Program NTP for substances in the Report therefore the listing of a substance does not establish that any such substance presents a risk to persons in their daily lives Such risk assessments are properly the purview of the appropriate Federal State and local health regulatory and
