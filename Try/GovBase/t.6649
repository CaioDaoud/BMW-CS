Information Bovine tuberculosis is a common slow growing disease that has affected animal health throughout recorded history The state of California has been involved in eradication programs since 1917 On April 25 2003 the United States Department of Agriculture USDA removed California from its list of tuberculosis TB accredited free states because three TB affected herds were detected within a 48 month period California is now classified as a TB modified accredited advanced State The three herds have been depopulated and provided no new herds are detected California can reapply for accredited free status in April 2005 To help prevent the spread of TB all sexually intact cattle and bison leaving California require official identification and a certificate stating that they were negative to an official tuberculin test done within 60 days prior to the date of movement unless moved to slaughter at an approved slaughtering establishment from an accredited herd and accompanied by
