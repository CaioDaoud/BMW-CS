Protection Act is identifying population subunits or stocks Populations can be subdivided from information on distribution and movements population trends morphological differences genetic differences contaminants and natural isotope loads parasite differences and oceanographic habitat differences The most direct measure of the rate of population subunit interchange is likely to be made by monitoring seasonal movements of animals instrumented with radio telemetry devices Although small cetaceans have been tagged with a variety of telemetry devices over the last 20 years in nearly all these studies the movement data have been collected for only very limited time periods because signals were received from the tags for only a few weeks Follow up studies to determine if signal loss was due to the animal moving out of monitoring range the instrument failing or attachment releasing prematurely have not been systematically undertaken However premature tag release due to tissue degradation has been documented or suspected in several studies Factors likely to affect attachment include tissue structure hydrodynamic drag which causes pressure necrosis on the tissue and biocompatibility of the pinning material Despite the influence of these factors tag design has generally given them only minor consideration In 1994 a project was initiated to instrument harbor porpoises in Washington coastal waters with satellite linked and Very High Frequency VHF transmitters The design goal was to use the smallest most hydrodynamic transmitters available with a 6 month life In order to maximize attachment longevity preliminary investigations of dorsal fin morphology instrument and saddle hydrodynamics and tissue biocompatibility of the saddle attachment material that penetrated the fin were made in the process of tag design In July 1995 a harbor porpoise was successfully captured and tagged with a satellite and VHF transmitter package off the coast of Washington It functioned for 3 weeks before contact was lost with the transmitters Also in 1995 western Atlantic harbor porpoises were instrumented with a newly designed satellite tag All the tags of that design remained on the animals in excess of a month and in one instance for over 6 months In order to evaluate the hydrodynamic drag characteristics of these tags a CaliforniaCurrent Hanson model htm View a picture of the model used to test the insturment fiberglass model of a harbor porpoise was made from the casting that had been made of an adult male that was killed incidental to commercial fishing operations The model was mounted in the University of Washington s Kirsten Wind Tunnel where it was subjected to wind speeds of 120 mph in order to compensate for the lower density compared to water Preliminary results suggest that these tags represent between 10 to 25 percent of the drag to a tagged animal Additionally changes in flow patterns around the animal s body from the addition of the tag are being investigated Future work will evaluate new more streamlined designs that will have less drag and hopefully provide longer attachment durations Special update June 2 1997 Read more
