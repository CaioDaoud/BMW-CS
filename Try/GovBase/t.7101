communication channels connecting individuals then plays the role of a nervous system for this superorganism i e a global brain It is an old idea dating back at least to the ancient Greeks that the whole of human society can be viewed as a single organism Many thinkers have noticed the similarity between the roles played by different organizations in society and the functions of organs systems and circuits in the body For example industrial plants extract energy and building blocks from raw materials just like the digestive system Roads railways and waterways transport these products from one part of the system to another one just like the arteries and veins Garbage dumps and sewage systems collect waste products just like the colon and the bladder The army and police protect the society against invaders and rogue elements just like the immune system Such initially vague analogies become more precise as the understanding of organisms increases The concepts of CYBSWHAT html systems theory provide a good framework for establishing a precise COMPTABL html correspondence between organismic and societal functions The fact that complex organisms like our own bodies are built up from individual cells led to the concept of superorganism If cells aggregate to form a MULTICEL html multicellular organism then organisms might aggregate to form an organism of organisms a superorganism Biologists agree that INSECSOC html social insect colonies such as ant nests or beehives are best seen as such superorganisms The activities of a single ant bee or termite are meaningless unless they are understood in function of the survival of the colony Individual humans may seem similar to the cells of a social superorganism but they are still much more independent than ants or cells ftp ftp vub ac be pub projects Principia Cybernetica WF issue Social MST txtl Heylighen Campbell 1995 This is especially clear if we look at the remaining competition conflicts and misunderstandings between individuals and groups Thus SOCIETY html human society is still an ambivalent system balancing between individual selfishness and collective responsibility In that sense it may be more similar to organisms like http www hhmi org science internat kay htm slime molds or http www uq edu au zzmwhybi Drivel Sponge html sponges whose cells can live individually as well as collectively than to true multicellular organisms However there seems to be a continuing trend towards global integration As technological and social systems develop into a more closely knit tissue of interactions transcending the old boundaries between countries and cultures the social superorganism seems to turn from a metaphor into a reality Although many people tend to see the super organism philosophy as a TOTALFRE html totalitarian or collectivist ideology the opposite is true further integration will basically increase individual freedom and diversity Most recently the technological revolution has produced a global communication network which can be seen as a nervous system for this planetary being As the computer network becomes more intelligent it starts to look more like a global brain or SUPBRAIN html super brain with capabilities far surpassing those of individual people see our page on LEARNWEB html learning brain like webs for an experimental approach to make the net more intelligent This is part of an evolutionary MST html transition to a higher level of COMPLEXI html complexity A remaining question is whether this transition will lead to the integration of the whole of humanity producing a human SUP META html super being or merely enhance the capabilities of individuals thus producing a multitude of meta beings In order to study these different issues
