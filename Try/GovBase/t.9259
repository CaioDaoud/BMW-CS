Water in pools ponds and bayous as far away as Texas and Louisiana splashed for nearly half an hour The cause Alaska s Denali Fault was on the move jostling the state with a magnitude 7 9 earthqua ke Dwindling Arctice Ice Since the 1970s Arctic sea ice has been melting at the rate of 9 percent per decade NASA researcher Josefino Comiso points to an accelerating warming trend as a primary cause and discusses how global climate change may be influencing the shrinking Arctic ice cap Savanna Smog Each August in southern Africa literally thousands of people equipped with lighters or torches go out into the African savanna a region dotted with villages and teaming with animals and intentionally set the dry grasslands ablaze Drought Lowers Lake Mead In the space of just three years water levels in Lake Mead have fallen more than sixty feet due to sustained drought Landsat images show the extent of the change to the lake s shoreline Study denali DAAC Study Denali s Fault Study LakeMead
