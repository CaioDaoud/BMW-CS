FLEISCHER Aboard Air Force One En route Charleston South Carolina 9 20 A M EDT EXCERPTS Also for this week to set up the week for you the President is calling on the Senate to take action on three vital measures this week One is to complete the landmark legislation of trade promotion authority which the House has now passed in final form to complete action on the first vote in the Senate on homeland security and also to complete action on defense appropriations That s what the President is looking to the Senate to do this week If the Senate can do that this week they too will be able to join the House in a week of accomplishment and action for the country One final note for you On Friday afternoon and into the wee hours of Saturday morning the President worked the phones for trade promotion authority He spoke to six members of Congress The last member he spoke to was at 2 20 a m The last phone call he made was at 3 40 a m he talked to Nick Calio more than a dozen times And obviously it s a very close vote and the President is very gratified by the House s action to break a decade long impasse of giving the President trade promotion authority Q Any names who was that last congressman MR FLEISCHER We never disclose the specific names of members that the President calls Suffice it to say it s time well spent He didn t get them all He got almost all of the ones he called I think he made seven spoke to seven members The last one as I mentioned was at 2 20 a m He and Nick just kept in real close touch There are times when he d talk to Nick and Nick would literally hand his phone to a member and the President would talk to that member into the wee hours Q Out of the seven he got all seven or MR FLEISCHER No no no I said he did not get them all he got almost all of them he got five out of the seven Click on your state below or go to the state list for more information statelist htm state list image map of the United States Montana mt htm Washington
