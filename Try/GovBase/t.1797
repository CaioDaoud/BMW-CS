enacted in 1977 to prevent redlining and to encourage banks and thrifts to help meet the credit needs of all segments of their communities including low and moderate income neighborhoods It extends and clarifies the longstanding expectation that banks will serve the convenience and needs of their local communities The CRA and its implementing regulations require federal financial institution regulators to assess the record of each bank and thrift in helping to fulfill their obligations to the community and to consider that record in evaluating applications for charters or for approval of bank mergers acquisitions and branch openings The federal financial institution regulators are Office of the Comptroller of the Currency Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and Office of Thrift Supervision The law provides a framework for depository institutions and community organizations to work together to promote the availability of credit and other banking services to underserved communities Under its impetus banks and thrifts have opened new branches provided expanded services adopted more flexible credit underwriting standards and made substantial commitments to state and local governments or community development organizations to increase lending to underserved segments of local economies and populations CRA Institutions CRA applies to federally insured depository institutions national banks thrifts and state chartered commercial and savings banks OCC s CRA Responsibilities The CRA s implementing regulation 12 CFR 25 et seq requires the OCC to assess a national bank s record of helping to meet the credit needs of its entire community including low and moderate income neighborhoods consistent with safe and sound operations It also mandates that the agency consider that record in its evaluation of a bank s application for new branches or relocation of an existing branch bank mergers and consolidations and other corporate activities In general the OCC conducts a CRA examination of a national bank every three years However the Gramm Leach Bliley Act mandates an extended examination cycle for smaller banks CRA examinations for banks with an overall CRA rating of outstanding and aggregate assets of 250 million or less can be started no sooner than 60 months after the most recent CRA examination Similarly CRA examinations for banks with an overall CRA rating of satisfactory and aggregate assets of 250 million or less can be started no sooner than 48 months after the most recent CRA examination Banks may be removed from this extended CRA examination cycle for reasonable cause or in connection with an application for a depository facility The OCC publishes an advance notice of scheduled CRA examinations quarterly A written performance evaluation of the bank s CRA activities including a CRA rating is prepared at the end of each CRA examination and made available to the general public The OCC encourages community and civic organizations government and other members of the public to express their views about a bank s CRA performance to the bank and the OCC at the earliest possible time This allows the bank to address any concerns and the OCC to take the public s views into account in evaluating the bank s CRA record and reaching conclusions about its performance ratings If those comments are sent to the OCC the OCC will also consider them when reviewing applications covered by the CRA Additional Information If you are interested in obtaining
