Children s Environmental Health Program Under Governor Davis leadership California has taken important steps to protect children from environmental pollutants with unprecedented funding to support clean ups of hazardous substances at school sites to evaluate air quality in portable classrooms and to ensure our environmental standards safeguard infants children and other sensitive people This is

Acrobat 3 223 KB The Children s Environmental Health Center is required to report biennially on the implementation of the Governor s Children s Health Initiative embodied in Chapter 144 Statutes of 2000 and the Children s Environmental Health Protection Act Chapter 731 Statutes of 1999 The report covers the activities of Cal EPA s Boards Departments and Office for calendar years 2000 and 2001 Children s Environmental Health Program Under Governor Davis leadership California has taken important steps to protect children from environmental pollutants with unprecedented funding to support clean ups of hazardous substances at school sites to evaluate air quality in portable classrooms and to ensure our environmental standards safeguard infants children and other sensitive people The California Environmental Protection Agency Cal EPA and its boards departments and office are implementing these pioneering programs under several laws including the Children s Environmental Health Protection Act of 1999 and the Governor s Children s Environmental Health Initiative Collectively these programs address growing concerns and issues about protecting children s health particularly from potential exposures in the school environment The Davis Administration has provided over 9 million for children s environmental health programs throughout Cal EPA organizations CEHC and CAPHI Receive Grant from ECOS to Improve Air Quality Health Information for Asthmatic Children at School and Play The Children s Environmental Health Center CEHC within the Office of the Secretary for Environmental Protection and the California Asthma Public Health Initiative CAPHI within the Chronic Disease Control Branch of the Department of Health Services are pleased to announce receipt of a grant from the Environmental Council of the States ECOS The grant will allow CEHC and CAPHI to study how and when air quality information is reported to schools K 12 and after school programs for children Such information is essential to reducing children s exposures to air pollutants like ozone and particulate material that can trigger asthma In collaboration with several air quality management districts school districts schools and school nurses we will develop models for effectively communicating air quality and health information and develop a list of alternative outdoor activities that can reduce exposures to elevated levels of air pollutants The challenge for schools and youth sports programs is to balance a child s need for exercise while protecting against the harmful effects of air pollutants like ozone on developing lungs and preventing asthma attacks in sensitive children The project runs through August of 2004 The grant will implement one of the Asthma Action Agenda items developed by ECOS and the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials Highlights of Cal EPA s accomplishments and priorities for 2002 include Cal EPA established the Children s Environmental Health Center CEHC headed by an Assistant Secretary for Children s Environmental Health to coordinate actions agency wide This year Cal EPA will host a Children s Environmental Health Awareness Day and continue to work with the U S Environmental Protection Agency s U S EPA Office of Children s Health Protection on childhood asthma related issues The Department of Toxic Substances Control DTSC reviewed and evaluated 509 reports on properties being considered for new school construction and provided regulatory oversight of cleanup work at 12 of these sites Remediation is planned at 33 additional school sites and 250 site evaluations are scheduled for this year The Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment OEHHA DTSC and the Department of Education are working together to characterize the school site environment and prepare guidance on multimedia risk assessments particularly for five contaminants commonly found at school sites OEHHA also conducted two symposia last year to identify the key physiological and toxicological areas for chemical risk assessment A third symposium is scheduled in spring 2002 The Air Resources Board s ARB groundbreaking investigation of long term exposures to air pollutants shows that children living in communities with the highest levels of air pollution have slower lung function growth rates This long term children s health study is expanding its scope to better understand the effects of complex mixtures of atmospheric pollutants on lung function and to ascertain if the effect persists in children as they mature Last year ARB identified six school sites for air monitoring to help determine the adequacy of California s air quality monitoring network to measure infants and children s exposures to air pollutants ARB completed a pilot study that examined children s exposures during their school bus commute and will conduct a larger study that includes monitoring for gaseous and particulate pollutants inside school buses as well as monitoring at bus stops and loading areas ARB as part of a portable classroom study obtained data on formaldehyde from nearly 1 000 schools statewide This year ARB will collect data on other pollutants and environmental factors from two portable classrooms and one traditional classroom at each of 70 randomly selected schools statewide ARB and OEHHA completed a review of the California Ambient Air Quality Standard for particulate material for its adequacy in protecting sensitive populations including infants and children Cal EPA staff will begin an assessment of the ozone standard this year OEHHA also prioritized those toxic air contaminants TAC that may differentially impact children The Scientific Review Panel selected five TACs to be revised or for which an air toxics control measure ATCM will be developed ARB began review of the dioxin and lead ATCMs last year these will be revised by mid 2003 Under the Healthy Schools Act the Department of Pesticide Regulation DPR established a voluntary school integrated pest management IPM program DPR surveyed 1 000 school districts to ascertain their pest problems and needs DPR developed and provided presentations and instructional events DPR is also developing a train the trainer program and guidebook so school districts can implement integrated pest management practices Licensed pest control businesses now complete and submit a new reporting form when any pesticide is used at a school DPR and the Department of Education are jointly implementing the School IPM Program Last year the Integrated Waste Management Board IWMB implemented the http www ciwmb ca gov Playgrounds Playground Safety and Recycling Act Grant Program and awarded 2 4 million to 56 applicants These funds help upgrade and repair public playgrounds and playground equipment with recycled content materials This year IWMB will offer 2 6 million in playground grants News News Home Last updated
