of a new system for mirror positioning on the infrared beamline Beamline 1 4 have shown that it reduces photon beam intensity fluctuations by an order of magnitude The system uses visible light from the ALS and a position sensitive detector as feedback to control the angle of the beamline s fifth mirror The mirror is mounted on a two axis piezoelectric stage that moves to maintain a consistent beam position relative to the detector A subsequent mirror reflects the infrared light but allows the unwanted visible light to pass through Preliminary tests showed a ten fold decrease in intensity fluctuation at frequencies up to 100 Hz and some correction up to about 800 Hz The system was developed by Wayne McKinney Mike Chin Greg Portmann and Mike Martin all of the ALS with input from Ed Melczer Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory regarding similar systems in use at the Livermore lab 2 SCIENTIFIC ADVISORY COMMITTEE MEETS ON LINE S On June 3 the ALS Scientific Advisory Committee SAC held a conference call meeting that featured more than the typical audio connection While local members gathered to see presentations on site more distant members tuned in by telephone and over the World Wide Web As the presenters displayed viewgraphs in the ALS mezzanine conference room members listening to the conference call clicked through the same viewgraphs on the Internet They were also able to view the contents of handouts distributed at the meeting through the Web interface The new approach was well received and the ALS plans to use the same system for future conference calls The SAC members heard and approved several proposals One of these was a proposal from a nationwide consortium of universities to build a pair of protein crystallography beamlines for molecular structural biology A proposal to build a diffraction beamline for materials chemistry was also approved as was a proposal to switch a future bend magnet based protein crystallography beamline to a superbend beamline In addition the SAC s ad hoc microscopy review committee gave a preliminary report based on its February review 3 NEW LONG TERM SCHEDULE ON THE WEB Contact GFKrebs lbl gov A new long term operating schedule extending to December 1999 has been approved by the Users Executive Committee The schedule can be seen on the Web at http www als lbl gov als schedules current ltsch html http www als lbl gov als schedules current ltsch html You can also reach it by following the Operating Schedules link from the ALS home page http www als lbl gov http www als lbl gov For convenient printing the schedule appears as a graphic in Portable Document Format as an Excel file and as a Word document 4 USER STOCK ROOM AND EQUIPMENT POOL MOVING Contact DJHamamoto lbl gov Because of the construction of an elevator where the ALS equipment pool is currently located the users stock room and equipment pool will be relocated to Building 7 The new stock room will be accessible through the center door of building 7 facing the lower parking lot Once in the hallway of Building 7 users will be able to open the stock room door with their key card The move is expected to take place this week In the process the ALS will enlarge the stock room and expand on the inventory Users who would like new items in the stock room should send their requests to Donna Hamamoto 510 486 5527 DJHamamoto lbl gov 5 ELECTRICAL ENGINEERS AND MECHANICAL TECHNICIANS GET NEW LEADERS Beginning July 1 the ALS will have a new Electrical Engineering Group Leader in the person of Walter Barry Walter comes to us from the Berkeley Lab Accelerator and Fusion Research Division AFRD where he worked as a member of the Beam Electrodynamics Group Walter is no stranger to the ALS As part of his seven year stint with AFRD he worked on the design development and implementation of the transverse feedback systems for the ALS and for the B Factory at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center The current Electrical Engineering Group Leader Jim Hinkson will return to the group s Instrumentation Section The Mechanical Technicians will also have several changes in leadership as of July 5 Dan Colomb will continue his role as Section Leader working with the unit leaders assigned to the main ALS experiment floor and handling administrative duties for the section Wayne Wayno Oglesby head of the Mechanical Installation Unit will take over Dan s other role as Building 80 Fabrication Facility Lead Wayno will be responsible for completing formal ALS job orders and user fabrication requests With Wayno s departure Dennis Hull will take over leadership of the Mechanical Installation Unit The installation team in turn will gain a new mechanical technician Greg Hay Greg s previous assignment was in AFRD s Superconductor and Cable Development Group working at the cable winding facility in Building 52 The current leaders will assist the new ones during a three to four week overlap period 6 USERS MEETING T SHIRT DESIGNS DUE FRIDAY JULY 23 Contact EJMoxon lbl gov As we announced in the last issue of ALSNews ALS users staff family and friends are invited to submit designs for an ALS T shirt The winner will have his or her signed artwork featured on T shirts for participants at this year s ALS Users Meeting October 18 20 Designs should be no larger than 8 5 in by 11 in 22 cm by 28 cm The words Advanced Light Source or ALS must appear somewhere in the design Send designs by July 23 to Elizabeth Moxon Advanced Light Source Berkeley Lab MS 4 230 Berkeley CA 94720 or fax to 510 495 2111 7 TWO POSTDOC POSITIONS IN SOFT X RAY SPECTROSCOPY Contact TCallcott utk edu The soft x ray SX spectroscopy Participating Research Team PRT for Beamline 8 0 at the ALS is soliciting applications for two postdoctoral positions to be available in September 1999 Position 1 is for an endstation manager to maintain and schedule the SX fluorescence endstation currently installed on Beamline 8 0 Position 2 is for a scientist to oversee construction and commissioning of a new endstation enabling angle resolved measurements of both SX photons and photoelectrons Both scientists are expected to also conduct a personal research program using the PRT s facilities For further information see the University of Tennessee Department of Physics and Astronomy job listings at http www phys utk edu jobs htm http www phys utk edu jobs htm or
