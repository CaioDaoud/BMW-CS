Research for Practice examines two unpublished NIJ funded studies on the use of pepper spray in real life arrests and compares them with previous studies While the research does not and cannot prove that pepper spray will never be a contributing factor in the death of a subject resisting arrest it seems to confirm that pepper spray is a reasonably safe and effective tool for law enforcement officers to use when confronting uncooperative or combative subjects http www ojp usdoj gov bjs abstract bcft01 htm Background Checks for Firearm Transfers 2001 BJS Jan 2003 From the inception of the
