in the service of conservation We are committed to building partnerships to encourage conservation and preserve our natural and cultural resources to bringing innovative approaches to solving land management and water disputes and to developing energy including renewable sources of energy in the most environmentally protective manner During the time I have served as Secretary of the Interior I have had the opportunity to observe firsthand the success of the 4 Cs I have met with ranchers and farmers who have changed how they do business in order to protect wildlife and save water I have visited landowners who are preserving habitat for endangered species and I have seen industry step up to the plate to help us address important environmental issues for example by donating and restoring thousands of acres of hardwood bottom lands in the Southeast that will provide habitat for species and help sequester greenhouse gases I have met with American Indian and Alaska Native leaders who are determined to improve the quality of life for their people through better educational opportunities and enhanced economic development This is an exciting time to be at the Department of the Interior and an exciting time to be involved in conservation Through programs like Take Pride in America and friends groups at individual parks and refuges we have over 200 000 volunteers and countless public and private partner organizations that are helping to preserve and improve our public lands and meet the mission of the Department Together we are achieving healthy lands and thriving
