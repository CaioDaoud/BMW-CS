page for the Cooperative Satellite Learning Project CSLP The CSLP is a business government and educational partnership focusing on space sciences and engineering Current sponsors are http www nasa gov NASA homepage html The National Aeronautics and Space Administration NASA and http www honeywell com Honeywell Technology Solutions Inc Students at the participating high schools learn about all aspects of how NASA satellite systems work They also receive valuable training about the workplace through Work Environment Program presentations These presentations emphasize skills such as Total Quality Leadership TQL Planning Processes and Oral Presentation Skills NASA Logo The Mission The Cooperative Satellite Learning Project CSLP will motivate students regardless of age race or sex into science engineering math and computers educate students and the community about space science and prepare students for careers after school through hands on involvement in scientific missions The Goals CSLP will encourage community involvement in education and will educate the community by distributing and presenting information about space science CSLP will provide teachers a resource for developing space science education programs and partnerships CSLP will provide the science community a resource for developing space science outreach education programs and partnerships CSLP will encourage the development of partnerships with businesses education institutions students and the community at large CSLP will prepare students for the future work force by developing the skills required for professional careers CSLP will support local state and national efforts to reform science mathematics and technology education CSLP will encourage community involvement in education and will educate the community by distributing and presenting information about space science CSLP will provide teachers a resource for developing space science education programs and partnerships CSLP will provide the science community a resource for developing space science outreach education programs and partnerships The Sponsors http triana gsfc nasa gov home Triana logo http triana gsfc nasa

people work so hard to create and maintain a program such as CSLP There are obviously as many reasons as there are volunteers but I will give you one The ATSC and NASA volunteers who come to your schools are what you might call the second generation of space pioneers The first generation put humans into space and eventually on the Moon My generation concentrated on exploring Earth and near space but also on building the aerospace infrastructure But I think its going to be the third generation your generation which is going to have all the real fun I believe you will put humans back on the Moon permanently You will complete and operate the first permanently occupied space station You will exploit the emerging technology to clean the air and water to feed 10 people where one can be fed now and to create medical breakthroughs which can only be dreamed of today You will also be the first generation which will routinely travel on transcontinental shuttles above the Earth s atmosphere And you will go to Mars and to Europa and perhaps even beyond You CSLP students have the unique opportunity to be the leaders in the inevitable technical and cultural evolution which will take shape over the next four decades So perhaps a little selfishly we do what we do because we understand how vital your leadership will be to the successful continuation of our own life s work So welcome please take full advantage of opportunities like today and above all have fun An excerpt from Kevin Griffin s welcoming speech at the Spring 1997 CSLP student conference f ont Respond to the
