preface Preface overview Overview discuss Discussion synopsis Synopsis of Retention Policies reqs Derivative Requirements Preface NASA presently has many not wholly consistent records disposition schedules for various subsets of its scientific data Further a 1995 NARA National Archives and Records Administration sponsored NAS National Academy of Sciences report on the roles of federal science agencies relative to NARA s own role in the preservation of science data from those agencies programs offers a very different view than that under which NASA s current records disposition schedules were created A new data retention policy for all NASA science data in the new NAS formulated NARA accepted framework is needed This white paper once evolved and approved will be that policy statement and will be used as the basis for a comprehensive records disposition schedule for NASA science data Overview Briefly this white paper identifies a very small category of NASA science data corresponding to seminal observations which will be declared permanently important Copies of these records will be given to NARA for its permanent archives All NASA science data are designated for either scheduled release or indefinite retention within NASA or other science agency archives Conditions for scheduled releases and the rare conditions for release of data originally marked for indefinite retention are given Discussion Observational data from NASA missions record the state of some aspects of our Earth solar system or universe at some time point Because our world is continually changing time stamped data cannot be recreated once abandoned or lost New and old data addressed in new combinations and in new ways enable us to increasingly understand our physical world Therefore NASA observational data represent an asset which must be retained in a usable state into the indefinite future There are many datasets that result from a given NASA investigation ranging from the initially downlinked telemetry data to some highly summarized versions of the physical parameters derived from the measurements Not all such datasets need to be retained indefinitely The concept of the definitive dataset resulting from a given investigation is important here The definitive dataset contains all the science potential of the investigation in that no irreversible transformations have been applied to the data The definitive dataset has been cleaned for telemetry errors has typically been time aligned with overlaps removed has needed ancillary data e g orbit attitude appended and has been otherwise annotated as appropriate In other words the definitive dataset is the highest level not yet irreversibly transformed dataset from an investigation In some circles this is called the Level 1A data processing level Definitive datasets from NASA missions should be retained indefinitely Datasets leading up to the production of the definitive dataset should be retained only to a point six months past the creation and certification of the definitive dataset Certification implies that all appropriate tests have been done by mission personnel to ensure that the definitive dataset faithfully captures the content of the datasets from which it was generated Typically one or more data sets are generated from definitive datasets These derived datasets post definitive data sets are typically more immediately usable than the definitive datasets often because sensor outputs have been convolved with calibration coefficients to produce geophysical parameters with which science analyses are done Some of these derived datasets capture much of the science potential of the investigation insofar as full or near full coverage and resolution in the independent variable space time space energy etc of the investigation are retained On the other hand many higher level derived datasets retain only a small but possibly highly important fraction of the science potential of the original observations Derived datasets should be retained as long as they remain scientifically viable i e algorithms or coefficients used in their derivation remain credible and the cost of regenerating them for some anticipated request level outweighs the cost of their retention and maintenance Note that some derived data sets become widely used and become considered definitive we use definitive in a different sense in this paper as described above Datasets to be retained indefinitely should be initially archived in adherence to then relevant standards regarding formats media etc and with all supporting material documentation ancillary data software etc needed to make the data correctly and independently usable Data integrity must be maintained no data loss due to media deterioration and datasets must continue to be findable accessible and usable Ensuring continuing data integrity and usability requires periodic data renewal cycles Some such cycles will involve only bit migration from old to new media Other such cycles may involve more resource intensive data reorganizations and or reformattings and sometimes even recreation of related software Upon entering into particularly resource intensive data renewal cycles for definitive data sets archive managers may solicit from the appropriate NASA Science Associate Administrator AA approval to release destroy the dataset rather than to renew it The AA will approve such release if after consultations with representatives of the potential data using community he she determines the data renewal costs would not be justified in light of limited projected future use of the data As long as independently usable definitive data set s from a given investigation continue to exist derived post definitive datasets from that investigation about to undergo a data renewal cycle may be released by archive managers as long as in their judgements and with the concurrence of their advisory committee of potential users the cost of renewal and further retention is not justified by projected future data usage especially given the dataset regeneration option Where derived data sets still exist for a given investigation but the corresponding definitive data set s no longer exist then the derived data set retaining the greatest measure of the science potential of the investigation will be treated as if it were a definitive data set in terms of requiring AA approval for its release NASA will endeavor to minimize data renewal cycle costs and hence to maximize renewal retention of definitive and derived data sets and their supporting materials by definition and implementation of standards for data formats metadata software etc There is a small number of observational records that NASA and NARA will declare permanently important thereby placing them in the domain of the National Archives and Records Administration through the intermediary of the NASA Records Management Office Such records will correspond to truly seminal observations having extraordinary impacts on the evolution of space and Earth sciences NARA s involvement in the identification of such records will exploit its greater sense for the historic value of selected observations NASA will also retain copies of such observational records as parts of datasets identified for indefinite retention within NASA for support of future science usage In some cases especially in Earth science NASA may make arrangements with other federal science agencies for the longterm archiving and dissemination of definitive and derived data sets In such cases NASA will ensure that the archiving agency s policies and practices are as strongly favorable for preserving data integrity and usability as are NASA s Data from NASA in space laboratory like experiments e g life science experiments performed on the space shuttle or space station are in principle repeatable and as such do not have the same rationale for indefinite retention as the observational record of our continually changing world Nevertheless given the expense of spaceflight experiments data from such experiments will be accorded the same treatment as discussed in the foregoing for observational data Note that the foregoing approach whereby NASA ensures into the indefinite future the integrity and usability of and access to science data from its missions is fully consistent with the NAS NRC 1995 report Preserving Scientific Data On Our Physical Universe principally sponsored by NARA with secondary sponsorship by NOAA and NASA Synopsis of Retention Policies a NASA and NARA will designate a small subset of NASA observational data records having sufficient historical importance to be included in NARA s permanent archives Copies of such records will be given to NARA Copies will also be retained in NASA archives to support future scientific use b Pre definitive data from a given mission or investigation will be released six months after project personnel certify that the definitive data set s created therefrom faithfully replicate their content c Definitive datasets and for missions or investigations where definitive datasets no longer exist derived data sets retaining most science potential of the mission or investigation will be retained indefinitely except they can be released with approval of the relevant Science Associate Administrator on the basis of the cost to renew retain exceeding anticipated future value Such releases are expected to be rare d Other derived data sets will be retained indefinitely as long as they are scientifically credible except they can be released by archive managers on the basis of the cost to to renew retain exceeding the cost to regenerate to meet anticipated future demand e NASA may delegate to other federal science agencies the responsibilities for ensuring indefinite preservation accessibility and usability if those agencies policies are as favorable as NASA s for data preservation etc f Data from NASA s in flight laboratory like experiments will be retained according to the same principles as for non repeatable time stamped observational data Derivative Requirements not specific to data retention release a Projects must create and certify optimally standards adherent definitive data sets and accompanying material documentation ancillary data software etc as needed to make the data independently usable and deliver them to NASA s managed archives Projects plans should be spelled out in Project Data Management Plans b NASA archives must ensure the continuing preservation accessibility and usability of the data in their care Plans for doing so should be spelled out in Archives Operating Plans c NASA archives must have user advisory committees to advise on among other things the likely future use and value of datasets candidate for resource intensive renewal cycles http nssdc gsfc nasa gov NSSDC Home Page Author Dr Joseph H King mailto joseph
