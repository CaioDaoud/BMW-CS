exploration and investigation Major targets for Astrobiology missions include mars Mars europa Europa titan Titan comets Comets planets and stars Planets outside our solar system intl space station The International Space Station and perhaps surprisingly our own earth Earth and moon Moon Astrobiology opportunities within the NASA http solarsystem nasa gov index cfm Solar System Exploration Program include reconstructing the chemical evolution histories of Earth Mars Europa Titan and comets returning samples from Mars to test for fossil life and searching for liquid water on Mars and Europa Mars Liquid water once flowed on the surface of Mars and may still exist below its surface under conditions that some terrestrial organisms would find habitable Currently in orbit the http

orbit is designed to determine the composition of the Martian surface to detect water and shallow buried ice and to study the radiation environment Currently en route to Mars are NASA s twin robotic geologists the http mars jpl nasa gov mer Mars Exploration Rovers Each rover carries a sophisticated set of instruments designed to search for evidence of liquid water that may have been present in the planet s past Both rovers are scheduled to arrive in January of 2004 By comparing Earth to Mars scientists will better understand Earth s history and perhaps its future The data will also help in planning http mpfwww jpl nasa gov future missions Approximately every two years NASA will launch both a Mars orbiter and a Mars lander for detailed explorations of Mars http mpfwww jpl nasa gov Future missions may include searching for water seeking the cause of the profound environmental changes on Mars and returning samples from Mars to test for fossil life Europa The http www jpl nasa gov galileo gem fact html Galileo mission has provided tantalizing evidence that Europa a moon of Jupiter may hide a sea of liquid water beneath its icy crust Astrobiology goals include determining whether an ocean is present characterizing the prebiotic organic history and searching for life A number of future missions to Europa have been proposed including the http solarsystem nasa gov missions jup missns jup europa html Europa Orbiter and the http www jpl nasa gov jimo mission cfm Jupiter Icy Moons Orbiter The Europa Orbiter proposed for launch in March of 2008 will use a radar sounder to examine the thickness of Europa s ice Other instruments would reveal details of the surface and interior processes The Jupiter Icy Moons Orbiter proposed for launch in 2012 or later will orbit three Jovian moons Callisto Ganymede and Europa Such missions will serve as precursor missions for hydrobots or remote controlled submarines that could melt through the ice and explore the undersea realm Titan http solarsystem nasa gov features planets saturn titan html Titan is the only moon in the solar system with a thick atmosphere composed largely of nitrogen and a sophisticated organic chemistry In 2004 the http saturn jpl nasa gov index cfm Cassini orbiter will deliver the h 20http sci esa int science e www area index cfm fareaid 12 Huygens Probe into the atmosphere of

Space Agency ASI Comets http www2 Astrobiology com astro comets html Comets may have been critical to the origin of life on Earth Some theories suggest that comets which consist largely of water ice may have http www gsfc nasa gov gsfc spacesci origins linearwater linearwater htm created the Earth s oceans Other research suggests that comets may be rich in prebiotic organic compounds and that comet impacts could have seeded the early Earth with the organic material needed for the origin of life There are several current and future missions that target comets for study including a comet sample return mission and the possibility of commercial missions Astrobiology goals include determining the degree of prebiotic chemistry and the water organic inventory of comets to evaluate their role in the origin of life and development of habitable worlds Now http stardust jpl nasa gov mission Stardust Launched in 1999 Stardust is designed to fly close to a comet and for the first time bring cometary material back to Earth for analysis Stardust will encounter comet Wild 2 in January of 2004 collect cometary material and interstellar dust streaming into the solar system and then return these samples to Earth in 2006 Now http www muses c isas ac jp Muses Muses C Muses CN also known as Hayabusa was launched in May of 2003 and is currently en route to Asteroid 1998SF36 After its arrival in 2005 Muses C will collect up to three surface samples from the asteroid and then return them to Earth in 2007 This is a joint mission being carried out by the http www nasda go jp index e

rosetta Rosetta Scheduled for launch in February of 2004 the international comet mission Rosetta will deliver a lander to the Comet 67P Churyumov Gerasimenko in order to study the comet s nucleus On its 10 year journey to the comet Rosetta will also pass by and observe at least one asteroid Planets outside Our Solar System Now http hubble nasa gov Hubble Space Telescope The Hubble Space Telescope has been instrumental to the advancement of Astrobiology having significantly expanded our understanding of planet formation star formation and the origins of the universe Now http sirtf caltech edu SIRTF Launched in August of 2003 the Space Infrared Telescope Facility SIRTF has now begun its 2 5 year mission The highly sensitive telescope will enable studies of great interest to Astrobiology These include studies of protoplanetary and planetary debris disks and deep surveys of the early universe 2004 http sofia arc nasa gov SOFIA The Space Observatory for Infrared Astronomy SOFIA will be

Mission The Kepler Mission will aid astrobiologists in the search for habitable planets Of the planets detected so far with the exception of the pulsar planets all of them are on the order of jovian Jupiter sized or larger in mass The challenge now is to find Earth class planets which are 300 times less massive than Jupiter The Kepler Mission has been proposed to discover and characterize hundreds of Earth class planets and will determine the frequency of Earth class and larger planets in and near the habitable zone of a wide variety of spectral types of stars 2009 http planetquest jpl
