ANNOUNCES BIOTERRORISM AID FOR STATES INCLUDING SPECIAL OPPORTUNITY FOR ADVANCE FUNDING HHS Secretary Tommy G Thompson today announced 1 4 billion to be provided to states this year to help them enhance preparations against terrorism or other public health emergencies At the same time he announced special provisions that would allow states to obtain up to 20 percent of their 2003 funding immediately in order to support current activities including smallpox vaccination for selected health workers and emergency responders Once again we are rapidly getting federal funding for public health preparedness into the hands of our states and hospitals Secretary Thompson said Together we ve made strong progress in the past year to strengthen our public health systems but this remains an ongoing endeavor We will continue to work with our state and local partners to enhance our readiness and our ability to respond to public health emergencies Our combined efforts will result in a stronger public health system to care for Americans in emergencies whether it be an outbreak of the flu or a biological incident Secretary Thompson said that some states will need a share of their 2003 funds right away while others will want to receive them later following the planning process that decision is left to each state But HHS is prepared to rapidly release up to 20 percent of this year s funds to any states that request it for ongoing public health and hospital preparations Part of the funding 870 million supports enhancement of states public health agencies and the rest 498 million is provided to states to support hospital preparedness for possible bioterror or other mass casualty events The funding is part of a total of about 3 5 billion in HHS funding this year for bioterrorism preparedness including research into potential bioterror disease agents and potential treatments and vaccines The fiscal year 2003 funding is up from about 1 8 billion for these activities in 2002 Secretary Thompson emphasized that HHS will continue to ensure that funds provided to the states are spent effectively to build the strongest possible protection and response capability for Americans As in 2002 states will be required to submit work plans to HHS outlining their public health and hospital preparedness activities including regional planning for areas that cross state lines While most funding for states will be released following approval of their plans Secretary Thompson told governors their states could receive up to 20 percent of their fiscal year 2003 allocation immediately in order to Support their smallpox vaccination activities for health workers and emergency responders Support activities already approved in 2002 state plans which need additional resources now Enhance or intensify critical activities already approved under last year s state plans Accelerate timelines for these critical activities Secretary Thompson said that the states would be notified of the expedited application procedure for obtaining the advance portion in the coming week The offer is similar to last year s action in which states obtained 20 percent of their 2002 funding in order to jump start state actions This year we are much further along and states that can use this advance funding productively are invited to do so Secretary Thompson said Amounts to be provided this year to each state and territory and to three metropolitan areas are as follows Amounts from HHS Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC are for public health systems preparedness and amounts from HHS Health Resources and Services Administration HRSA are for hospital preparedness Department of Health and Human Services Fiscal Year 2003 Public Health
