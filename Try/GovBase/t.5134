aboutnersc pubs html NERSC Publications and Conferences Scientific Discovery through Advanced Computing The goal of DOE s Scientific Discovery through Advanced Computing SciDAC initiative is to enable the use of terascale computers to dramatically extend exploration of the fundamental processes of nature as well as advance the ability to predict the behavior of a broad range of complex natural and engineered systems This will be achieved by creating a scientific computing software infrastructure to bridge the gap between the most advanced computing technologies available and the scientific research programs of the Office of Science SciDAC will include research in and development of computational modeling and simulation capabilities that take full advantage of the extraordinary computing capabilities provided by terascale computers and advance as no other approach can the fundamental science programs of DOE SciDAC will also include research and development of software to accelerate the creation of scientific codes that take full advantage of terascale and beyond computers protect the long term investments in these codes and enable a broad range of scientists to use simulation in their research In addition SciDAC will engage in research and development of collaboratory and networking software to link geographically separated researchers facilitate access to and movement of large 100s of terabytes to petabytes data sets and ensure that all qualified scientists can fully participate in the activities described above A number of SciDAC projects rely on the computational facilities and support provided by the NERSC High Performance Computing Center http scidac nersc gov Click here for details Computational Research NERSC is committed to constantly rethinking the four
