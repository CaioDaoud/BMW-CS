advocacy groups or community associations Media Requests made by newspapers journals broadcasting agencies etc Requests for Publications Requests for reports or publications available from the MD DE DC District Recently Asked Questions Q I had a question on the MEAN flow for 3 7 02 White Clay Creek at Newark DE The station number is 01478650 Your site says that the Mean flow for this day using 8 years of info is 160 ft3 That is hard to believe I really think there is some error here Also the 80 50 and 20 of mean are are confusing concepts They seem redundant Can you improve the explanation definition of these 80 50 and 20 numbers A Mean discharge is of course the number derived from the total mean flow on any given day divided by the number of years Median discharge is a more accurate picture of normal or expected flow for a given day median eliminates the higher storm event driven numbers The 50 per cent exceedance is the median flow The 80 exceedance figure for march 7 is 62 cfs meaning 80 of the time flow can be expected to be in this range or less We are currently experiencing drought levels which magnify the current differences from expected normal levels Also stations with longer periods of operation give a more accurate picture of what normal flow can be expected Q What is the mean annual discharge and stage for the station 01646500 POTOMAC RIVER NEAR WASHINGTON DC I have found a mean annual discharge at the USGS NAWQA Potomac River Basin webpage however I can t seem to locate the mean annual stage or a stage discharge curve to convert between the two The only recommendation that I would have for the NWIS Web is to add gaging station statistics to the station description mean annual flow maximum minimum etc Basically incorporate the information found on the USGS NAWQA Potomac River Basin webpage A plot of the stage discharge curve would also be very helpful Other than that it is a wonderful resource A Annual Mean Discharge for the water years 1930 58 before regulation 10790 CFS Annual Mean Discharge for the water years 1959 2001 regulated 11640 CFS 4 12 ft current equivalent stage Here is the link to our latest 2001 water year annual data report vol 1 surface water which contains detailed information on gaging stations monitored by the MD DE DC district office http md water usgs gov publications md de 01 1 http md water usgs gov publications md de 01 1 Q What we really need is riverine nitrogen discharge data for the Patuxent Patapsco and Pocomoke watersheds for the years 1987 1992 and 1997 In my literature searches I was only able to find riverine nitrogen discharge data as an average over a long time period but we would prefer the data as an average for the specific years Would you be able to help us find this information I was using total nitrogen but am open to your suggestions and flexible if data availability require it A i would first take a look at the river input program http va water usgs gov chesbay RIMP 20 http va water usgs gov chesbay RIMP this program has been quantifying nutrient loads to major tribs for the last 20 years and one of their tribs is the patuxent i don t think that we ve quantified actual loads for the other two tribs that you asked for but NAWQA may have something on the pocomoke http water usgs gov nawqa http water usgs gov nawqa you could also contact judy denver for more info on NAWQA mailto jmdenver usgs gov jmdenver usgs gov other than that please feel free to browse our district web page and see if you can find more info http md water usgs gov http md water usgs gov the bay program may also be able to help http www chesapeakebay net index cfm http www chesapeakebay net index cfm Q I am faced with the unpleasant task of replacing our residential water well We purchased our property in Lusby in 1981 Well water quality was always poor with strong sulfur smell iron which stains both laundry and appliance surfaces and a black oil like residue that coats the inside surfaces of water handling devices For the last 8 years water volume from this well has steadily diminished until we can use only one water consuming item at a time I have to date contacted four different well drilling companies in my area Most are unwilling to discuss doing anything but drilling a well for a set fee no discussion about alternative and possibly better water sources Others are willing to answer questions but claim to have no knowledge of what sort of water quality I would likely find from different aquifers or estimated drill depths to reach them Again some drillers want to go to the depth that I am now with no discussion of going deeper Others are willing to commit to drilling to a specified depth for a contract fee and then charging by the foot to reach the desired source One driller is willing to do some research to see what is available but I have not heard back from them I am willing to spend what is necessary for a quality well with the desire of having one that produces adequately will last many decades and gets me away from having to drink swamp drainings as my current well provides My question to you is 1 What aquifers are available in my area 2 What is the expected water quality of these sources 3 Is there an estimate of drill depth for the available options 4 Are any of these aquifers being drawn so hard that they should be avoided because of future water level drop and well loss I have attempted to use the available on line sites for USGS but am not sure that I can properly interpret these to provide the information that I need A There are four aquifers available in your area The uppermost is aquifer is an unconfined aquifer of surficial sediments I m guessing based on the information you provided that this is likely the aquifer your current well is screened in The next aquifer is the confined Piney Point Nanjemoy PP N aquifer The PP N aquifer is approximately 10 35 feet thick and the top of the aquifer is approximately 200 feet to 220 feet below sea level To calculate the depth of the well you would need to know the elevation of land surface of your property and then add 200 feet to it The next aquifer is the confined Aquia aquifer The Aquia aquifer is approximately 140 feet thick and the top of the aquifer is approximately 425 feet below sea level The deepest aquifer is the upper Patapsco aquifer This aquifer is interbedded sands and clays and are usually screened over multiple intervals at depths ranging from approximately 650 to 800 feet below sea level Water levels in Lexington Park are declining at about 2 to 3 feet per year with little withdrawal from the aquifer in the region I think that answers questions 1 and 3 Question number 4 was Are any of these aquifers being drawn so hard that they should be avoided because of future water level drop and well loss This may be a better question to ask the ground water appropriations people at the Maryland Department of the Environment MDE They are the people who approve your permit for your well but this is my general opinion on the subject I do not think that many wells are drilled into the surficial sediments anymore It was used more when wells were hand dug I think most new private homeowner wells are being permitted drilled in the Piney Point Nanjemoy aquifer because it is the shallowest least expensive aquifer The water levels in the PP N have a general decline of about 5 to 1 feet per year over the past 5 years This rate could continue at the same amount increase or decrease in the future Most larger users more than 10 000 gallons per day have wells screened in the Aquia aquifer In some areas the water levels are declining at a rate of about 2 to 5 feet per year Because of the rate of decline of the water levels I think that MDE is beginning to limit the number of wells that they permit for this aquifer The upper Patapsco aquifer is deep expensive to drill for a private homeowner well although some large users like St Mary s Commission on water METCOM are starting to use this aquifer The other drawback of this aquifer is that in some areas the sands are not real clean so it does not produce as much water per foot of screen as the Aquia or the Piney Point Nanjemoy aquifers As for water quality question 2 the PP N the Aquia and the upper Patapsco are all generally of good water quality In southern Maryland the water has been in these deep confined aquifers for thousands of years so it is not usually contaminated by humans like some of the shallower surficial aquifers I looked at a few reports and the pH for both the PP N and the Aquia aquifers ranges from about 7 5 to 8 0 The dissolved iron is usually less than 10 micrograms per liter ug L but a couple of samples had 300 to 500 ug L Dissolved sulfate ranged from about 5 milligrams per liter mg L to 40 mg L most of the samples were less than 10 mg L dissolved sulfate For further information I can mail you a copy of a report on the aquifers and water quality of the wells at the Naval Air Station Patuxent River You can also use NWIS Web accessible from the Maryland USGS webpage to search for wells in Calvert county www md water usgs gov and then click on NWISWeb Data Retrieval from the tan area on the left side of the web page Or to download a copy of the Maryland annual data report from the our webpage move the mouse on top of the word Publications located on the horizontal menu with words in red when the pop up menus shows click on On Line Publications When the page opens there will be a picture on the left then scroll down and below the picture it will say Water Resources Data Maryland and Delaware Water Year 2001 and then click on Volume 2 volume 2 is ground water volume 1 is surface water This will let you download the annual data report In the report are plots of water levels versus time these plots are called hydrographs for wells in the state They are listed by county and then well number and then properties of the wells such as well depth aquifer etc are given in the header Two other reports that may be helpful published by Maryland Geological Survey are Achmad G and Hansen H J 1997 Hydrogeology model simulation and water supply potential of the Aquia and Piney Point Nanjemoy aquifers in Calvert and St Mary s Counties Maryland Maryland Geological Survey Report of Investigations No 64 Chapelle F H and Drummond D D 1983 Hydrogeology digital simulation and geochemistry of the Aquia and Piney Point Nanjemoy aquifer system in southern Maryland Maryland Geological Survey Report of Investigations No 38 Information for obtaining these two reports is on the Maryland Geological Survey MGS web page http www mgs md gov http www mgs md gov Q I would like some info on the upove subject My questions are what part of the river will this water be taken from the impact on water table in said area and the impact on fish and wildlife in area I understand that the city of Frederick has 34 days supply of water and after that this trucking of water from potomac would be done I live close to the potomac and I am more than interested in the impact on the area as are others from the states who depend on the river Droughts are a part of nature As history shows a part of life No one seems to give any thought that Frederick County has grown larger than it s water supply and this plus a drought has caused the crisis The needs of the people have to be addressed in a long term way Please give many any info you can and any other sources of info A Your concern for the water resources in Maryland during this current drought is greatly appreciated Individual awareness and understanding of drought issues and impacts are of the utmost importance in preserving our precious water resources Fortunately in Maryland there is a state agency The Maryland Department of the Environment MDE that regulates water withdrawals from both surface waters and wells in the State through their water appropriation permits program You may also visit MDE s web page for more information http www mde state md us http www mde state md us Our USGS MD DE DC District web page may also have useful drought information for you http md water usgs gov http md water usgs gov Please let us know if we can be of further assistance Q Why does data for the same date and time change from day to day Report for this site on 8 12 2002 as of 07 00 showed discharge in cfs 9 Aug 10 Aug 11 Aug 07 00 4 60 4 40 4 40 On 08 16 2002 Report as of 07 00 showed discharge in cfs 9 Aug 10 Aug 11 Aug 07 00 2 50 1 90 1 90 I would think that once data is transmitted from the stream guage to your reporting system the data would not change a couple of day s later Stream flows that are reported by your system provide critical information for managing our water system and we place great reliance on the data your agency provides I didn t know if you were aware this is happening or maybe it is just with information from this meter A Based on recent discharge measurement stage discharge rating was changed at the low end to reflect latest information Earlier data was updated to correct based on this info our real time data is provisional as explained in the enclosed link http md waterdata usgs gov nwis help provisional http md waterdata usgs gov nwis help provisional Q What technology are you using for remote data gathering from instruments streamflow gages A Data from many real time streamflow gages are relayed to the Maryland Delaware D C District office in Baltimore through the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite GOES data collection system or by telephone Data are transmitted from each station at intervals of 4 hours and are loaded onto the District computer system This 4 hour interval is based on a transmission time window available for the satellite and is not controlled by USGS Data from other stations is obtained through an automatic telephone dial up and the computer is set to call on a 4 hour interval USGS does control this system but it is limited by the actual time that it takes to dial and download data USGS is investigating alternative systems to provide data on a more frequent basis during floods However because most existing real time streamflow gages are located on larger rivers and the hydrologic response time of these rivers is generally much greater than 4 hours the current system is adequate for most applications Instrumentation products currently used at this time are provided by Sutron Corp 8210 satellite modem and 8200 modem Electronic Data Loggers Q I have collected real time data for a gaging station on the Christina River for 3 different dates Station 01478000 On 12 11 01 the min flow was given as 2 4 cfs On 3 6 02 the min flow was given as 6 9 On 6 12 02 the min given was 4 4 WHAT is the minimum and how can it change to be larger The same question applies to maximum on 12 11 01 it was 1 030 On 3 6 02 it was 388 a number almost 3 times LESS On 6 12 that number is 284 HOW CAN a MAXIMUM flow become lower It defies my sense of statistics please educate me in how these figures are arrived at Obviously they are NOT really minimum or maximum flows over the entire period of record A I have included the site in question below and will attempt an explanation of the data As stated these are DAILY MEAN flow statistics for the current date june 12 for the period of record Current flow the most recent INSTANTANEOUS flow available which may may not result in a higher lower DAILY MEAN all instantaneous values recorded in a 24 HR period and AVERAGED Minimum LOWEST DAILY MEAN for June 12 for the period of record Mean The average of all daily means for June 12 Maximum HIGHEST DAILY MEAN for June 12 for the period of record Per cent exceedance is explained in the table Radical differences in day to day figures of max min are the results of various hydrologic events the obvious being rain storm warm weather and freeze up extended cold periods The 50 percent exceedance figure is your best indicator of normal flow Current Flow Minimum Mean Maximum 80 percent exceedence 50 percent exceedence 20 percent exceedence 4 1 4 4 22 8 284 7 40 12 0 20 0 Daily mean flow statistics for 6 12 based on 59 years of record in ft3 sec Percent exceedance means that 80 50 or 20 percent of all daily mean flows for 6 12 have been greater than the value shown Q We are trying to develop and apply a cell based watershed hydrology physical surface quantity quality model constructed of linear reservoirs linear canals and water routing water quality components For this we need a good set of measurements 3 to 5 years of rain hourly or less rain intensity flow hourly or less flow discharge and quality field and or laboratory analysis of water quality parameters such as nutrients We have been looking at the data available on the web and came to the conclusion that the USGS 01639000 MONOCACY RIVER AT BRIDGEPORT MD at the outlet of a 173 square miles watershed might be appropriate for us We would like to have the data of that station and additional data of the same sort of internal stations at the watershed A Water Quality data for nutrients and sediment were collected at this site during the 1990 96 water years oct 89 sept 96 when gage was instrumented with a pumping sampler Data can be accessed via NWIS WEB at http md waterdata usgs gov nwis nwis http md waterdata usgs gov nwis nwis A direct link to this data at http waterdata usgs gov md nwis qwdata site no 01639000 agency cd USGS 20 http waterdata usgs gov md nwis qwdata site no 01639000 agency cd USGS This office can provide you with 15 minute interval unit value discharge data for the period via download from our database to CD ROM which we can mail however unit value data file for the 1994 water year oct 93 sept 94 was corrupted and only daily value data available No charge for this data We
