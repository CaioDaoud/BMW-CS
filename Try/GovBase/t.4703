Catalog of Infrared Observations Home Page CATALOG OF INFRARED OBSERVATIONS Version 5 1 December 2000 ircenter gif Galactic Center 12 4 microns Galactic Center 12 4 m by Daniel Y Gezari by Daniel Y Gezari Patricia S Pitts Marion Schmitz NASA Goddard Space Flight Center The Catalog of Infrared Observations CIO Version 5 1 is a database of over 396 000 published infrared observations of more than 64 000 individual astronomical sources over the wavelength range from 1 to 1000 microns Version 5 1 includes observations published through 1998 The last printed edition of the Catalog Third Edition was released in June 1993 as NASA Reference Publication RP 1294 1 Access the Catalog Data There are three ways to interactively access the data in the on line Catalog 1 Browse the Catalog scroll through the Catalog listings 2 Access the Catalog data by source name or 3 Search the Catalog listings by specifying position wavelength flux You can also access the database of bibliographic references for each Catalog data entry by searching the bibliography of journal articles from which the catalog data were obtained search html Access Catalog 2 Access the Atlas of Infrared Sources It can be difficult to locate a source in the Catalog by its name because source names are not standardized and are often abbreviated in the database However all of the object names contained in the database are listed alphabetically in an Atlas of Infrared Sources which is a supporting tool built into the Catalog Click on the red button to find the source name in the Atlas and link to its location in the Catalog You can then scroll up and down to identify records corresponding to the source Obviously this option does not restrict the results to any particular source but does provide an efficient way to find the source in the Catalog browse listings html Locate Source 3 Access the Bibliography You can view the collection of journal articles from which the Catalog data were obtained arranged alphabetically by first author The listing includes the title of the paper and the search help html Biblio bibliographic reference number From the CIO search html Biblio Search Page you can search the bibliographic database by typing in a bibliographic reference number Select the button corresponding to the last name of the first author http ircatalog gsfc nasa gov cio browse aauthor
