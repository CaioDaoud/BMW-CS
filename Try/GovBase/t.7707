Earliest Moments in Time Can you imagine a docs dict qz html universe Universe without docs dict qz html star stars You ll need to go way back in time The Universe is now about 15 billion years old During the Universe s preschool years the first billion years or so there were no twinkling jewels to see in the night sky no docs dict ei html galaxy galaxies swirling about like pinwheels nor comets streaking across the heavens In fact for the first 400 000 years after the docs dict ad html big bang Big Bang the entire Universe was one great fog of docs dict jp html proton protons docs dict ei html electron electrons and docs dict qz html radiation radiation You couldn t see anything Sound boring On one level the scene does seem to be like an docs dict ad html astronomy astronomer s worst nightmare no stars no visibility Yet nothing could be further from the truth This fog is actually one of the hottest topics in science for hidden within the fog are clues to the most pressing questions of our existence What is the shape of the Universe What kind of strange docs dict jp html matter matter is in the Universe How did the Universe grow from a fireball to the vast structure of galaxies and docs dict ad html cluster of galaxies galaxy clusters we see today Does a mysterious force acting like anti docs dict ei html gravity gravity dominate the Universe For the big questions the fog is where it s at But how does one go about studying a fog that existed billions of years ago About 400 000 years after the Big Bang the fog lifted and docs dict jp html light light broke through This light essentially the afterglow of the Big Bang the very first light to shine in the Universe carries the history of what went on during those first years As fate would have it this fossil light is still shining today in the form of docs dict jp html microwave microwaves The entire Universe is bathed in the stuff Images map history gif History of the Universe A schematic of the history of the universe showing the difference before and after the lifting of the fog Click on image to enlarge it In summer 2001 docs dict jp html NASA NASA plans to launch the Wilkenson Microwave Anisotropy Probe WMAP to survey this ancient radiation in unprecedented detail Just as we can study dinosaur bones and reconstruct their lives from millions of years ago we can probe this ancient light and reconstruct the Universe as it was about 15 billions years ago WMAP will be looking at a cosmic glow far older than anything that the Hubble Space Telescope or docs dict ad html Chandra Chandra docs dict qz html X ray X ray Observatory can see WMAP will map slight temperature fluctuations within the microwave background that vary by only 0 00001 C across a chilly light that now averages 2 73 C above absolute zero The temperature differences today point back to docs dict ad html density density differences in the fiery baby universe in which there was a little more matter here and a little less matter there Areas of slightly enhanced density had stronger gravity than low density areas The high density areas pulled back on the background radiation making it appear slightly cooler in those directions The slight difference in density led to our current structure of galaxies galaxy clusters and voids of seemingly empty space So WMAP is a docs dict ad html cosmology cosmologist s dream come true supplying the long sought data needed to test the crazy theories we have of how it all began and how we got from there to here By comparing the earliest structure of the universe to what we see today WMAP will help determine how and when the first galaxies formed WMAP will also address the more trippy questions Is the universe s geometry flat or curved around in some funky way Is the stuff we re made of really an anomaly in a universe dominated by docs dict ad html dark matter dark matter and dark energy Is inflation correct the theory that the universe expanded from the atomic scale to the cosmic scale in a fraction of a second far faster than light Join us on this special exhibit as we explore the questions that WMAP will seek to
