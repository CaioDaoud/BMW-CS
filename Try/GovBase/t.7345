Diversified Refrigeration Inc Case No VEE 0079 Case No VEE 0079 March 2 2001 DECISION AND ORDER OF THE DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY Application for Exception Name of Petitioner Diversified Refrigeration Inc Date of Filing February 1 2001 Case Number VEE 0079 Diversified Refrigeration Inc DRI requests a six month exception from the 2001 energy appliance efficiency standards for built in refrigerators that become effective July 1 2001 As explained below we are granting DRI a six month exception from July 1 2001 to December 31 2001 that permits the firm to produce a specific number of non compliant refrigerators per month and requires DRI to submit monthly reports on the number of each model produced I Background The Energy Policy and Conservation Act EPCA directed the DOE to review and revise the 1989 energy conservation standards applicable to refrigerators See EPCA 325 b 3 B 42 U S C 6295 b 3 B 54 Fed Reg 47916 November 17 1989 Pursuant to that direction in 1997 the DOE finalized new standards that become effective on July 1 2001 62 Fed Reg 23101 April 28 1997 The DOE Organization Act DOEOA authorizes the DOE to grant exceptions to EPCA standards DOEOA 504 a 42 U S C 7194 a The DOEOA permits adjustments consistent with the purposes of EPCA as may be necessary to prevent special hardship inequity or unfair distribution of burdens The preamble to the notice promulgating the new refrigerator efficiency standards specifically refers to this provision 62 Fed Reg at 23 108 09 As the preamble indicates the DOE may grant an exception for a limited time and may place other conditions on the grant of relief including conditions related to the effects of the relief on competition Id at 23 109 The DOE s procedural regulations set forth the procedures applicable to exception applications 10 C F R Part 1003 Subparts B and C Subpart B provides the procedures for considering an exception request Subpart C provides the procedures for an appeal of an exception decision DRI s sole operation is a manufacturing facility in which it builds built in refrigerators for sale to GE Appliances GE DRI is located in Selmer Tennessee a town of approximately 4600 residents in southwestern Tennessee DRI employs a significant number of Selmer s 4600 residents DRI is one of four firms that manufacture built in refrigerators The other three are Viking Range Corporation Viking Whirlpool Corporation Whirlpool and Sub Zero Freezer Co Sub Zero Both Viking and DRI applied for exception relief In June 2000 Viking filed its application for exception requesting that OHA grant it an exception from the new refrigerator efficiency standards Specifically Viking requested a 12 month extension to comply with the standards Viking s three competitors Sub Zero Whirlpool and GE filed comments in opposition to Viking s request 4 The competitors did not challenge Viking s contention that it was unable to meet the deadline instead the competitors argued that Viking s inability to meet the deadline was the result of its own discretionary business decisions and that an exception would cause them competitive harm In a November 3 decision we granted Viking s request in part cases ee vee0075 htm Viking Range Corp 28 DOE 81 002 2000 Specifically we granted Viking a six month extension to meet the new standards based on our conclusion that the application of the July 1 2001 effective date to Viking would create an unfair distribution of burdens Sub Zero Whirlpool and GE appealed the November 3 decision In their appeals Sub Zero and Whirlpool opposed the relief granted GE on the other hand abandoned its opposition to the request and merely requested a technical modification i e that the exception relief be expressly limited to the refrigerator models for which Viking sought relief By separate order issued today we are affirming our grant of exception relief to Viking except that during each of the six months of exception relief from July 1 2001 to December 31 2001 the exception relief is limited to a total production of 475 refrigerators See cases ee vea0015 htm Sub Zero Freezer Co 28 DOE March 2 2001 During the pendency of the appeals of the Viking exception DRI filed its exception request DRI contends that it is unable to meet the deadline because of a loss of engineering staff due to high turnover and difficulty in recruiting new hires DRI contends that in the absence of relief it will have to shut down its factory All five parties DRI its customer GE Viking Sub Zero and Whirlpool were involved in our consideration of the DRI exception application In considering the DRI application and the Viking appeals we requested various types of information First we requested that DRI identify the models for which it sought relief and its sales of those models during each month in 1999 and 2000 DRI provided this information which indicated that it seeks relief for its side by side built in refrigerators Second we requested that the parties comment on a possible limitation on the exception relief to avoid giving the recipient of exception relief a competitive advantage We proposed to limit the number of units produced during the period of exception relief and we requested the parties views on such a limitation Viking and GE disagreed with such a limitation arguing that such a limitation was anti competitive Sub Zero and Whirlpool viewed such a limitation as an improvement over an unlimited grant of relief but nonetheless as inadequate to address their concern of competitive harm Third we requested information on the parties ability and intent to stockpile non compliant refrigerators 3 prior to the July 1 2001 effective date To the extent that manufacturers are able to stockpile such stockpiling would ameliorate the impact of an exception granted a competitor similarly to the extent that an exception applicant is able to stockpile its need for exception relief is reduced Diversified Viking and Whirlpool responded but Sub Zero did not Fourth we gave Sub Zero and Whirlpool the opportunity to submit information to support their claim that the relief put them at a cost disadvantage i e their expected change in marginal cost related to out of pocket manufacturing costs Sub Zero declined this opportunity but Whirlpool submitted the information Finally all parties agreed that the built in refrigerator market comprises a very small segment of the domestic refrigerator market In 1999 over 9 million refrigerators were produced of which approximately 140 000 were built in refrigerators It is also agreed that Sub Zero has over half of the built in refrigerator market that Viking has roughly three percent and that the remainder is divided between Whirlpool and GE DRI s customer We held a hearing on the DRI exception application on February 27 The hearing panel included an economist II Analysis It is undisputed that DRI cannot produce compliant refrigerators by the July 1 2001 deadline Sub Zero and Whirlpool argue however that had DRI been more diligent in its efforts to comply it would be able to do so Thus they argue DRI s inability to comply results from discretionary business decisions rather than an unfair distribution of burdens Our review of the information submitted by DRI indicates that had DRI begun its compliance efforts earlier DRI might have been able to meet the deadline We do not believe however that DRI s failure to begin compliance efforts earlier or to undertake more aggressive compliance efforts later are discretionary business decisions that preclude the grant of relief As an initial matter we observe that the characterization of a decision as discretionary does not preclude the grant of exception relief In one sense every decision is discretionary the word decision denotes the making of a choice Under that use of the word discretionary any need for relief could be traced to the discretionary decision to begin the business for which an exception is sought Accordingly the mere fact that a firm would not need exception relief had it made a different choice or a different set of choices does not preclude exception relief Instead exception relief is not appropriate where a firm makes a choice that does not reasonably take into account its regulatory obligations In such cases we refer to the choice as the primary cause for the firm s difficulty See e g Ince Minerals Corp 3 DOE 81 136 at 83 498 1979 firm s financial difficulties attributable to its incorrect assessment of quality of reserves rather than DOE regulations From hindsight it is clear that DRI should have begun its efforts to produce compliant refrigerators earlier than it did It is also possible that DRI and its customer GE could have taken more aggressive steps to comply On the other hand all parties agree that developing compliant refrigerators involves significant engineering effort and the record indicates that DRI encountered significant difficulties hiring and retaining either as employees or on a contract basis the number of engineers that it needed DRI attributes these problems to the competitive environment for engineers which was exacerbated in the refrigeration industry by the approaching effective date of the new standards Accordingly it appears to us that the primary cause of DRI s inability to meet the deadline was its failure to anticipate the unusual degree of difficulty it would encounter in obtaining sufficient engineering staff Based on the foregoing we do not believe that DRI s various choices along the way preclude a grant of exception relief Accordingly we proceed to consider the Sub Zero and Whirlpool arguments that the burden to DRI of not meeting the deadline does not outweigh the burden to them if exception relief is granted Sub Zero and Whirlpool argue that DRI has not established that the burden to DRI of a six month suspension of its refrigerator sales outweighs the competitive harm that Sub Zero and Whirlpool would suffer if we grant DRI a six month extension in which to sell non compliant refrigerators 4 We believe that it is clear that in the absence of relief DRI would suffer a significant burden DRI s only operation at its Tennessee plant is to produce built in refrigerators Accordingly in the absence of relief it will not be able to operate The inability to operate will result in the loss of six months of income necessitate a lay off of workers disrupt its relations with suppliers and with GE and have serious consequences on its long term ability to be competitive Thus in the absence of exception relief the impact of the new standards on DRI would be draconian In contrast we find that Sub Zero and Whirlpool have not shown that they would experience real harm from the grant of exception relief Their primary concern is that DRI and its customer GE could use the lower production cost of the non compliant refrigerators to gain market share Sub Zero and Whirlpool argue that an exception relief recipient will not pass through its design and retooling cost during the relief period We do not agree As we indicated in a prior decision firms pass through costs unless precluded by market conditions or a desire to increase market share See cases ee veh0015 htm Sub Zero Freezer Co 28 DOE January 31 2001 slip op at 5 6 The exception relief will not change market conditions which will apply to all the manufacturers of built in refrigerators Moreover we believe that a limit or cap on the number of units that can be produced pursuant to the exception relief largely ameliorates the concern about loss of market share Indeed Sub Zero and Whirlpool concede that a such limitation would mitigate their concern Tr at 24 25 On the other hand DRI and GE vehemently oppose such a limit arguing that a cap would be anti competitive After considering this matter carefully we have concluded that it is appropriate to place a cap on the relief A cap on the relief accomplishes two important objectives First as indicated above a cap addresses Sub Zero s and Whirlpool s concerns about competitive harm Second a cap helps to assure that in the future firms will not view exception relief as a short term alternative to compliance and that recipients of relief will expeditiously bring themselves into compliance Thus the purpose of a cap is not to punish the recipient of exception relief as suggested by GE see Tr at 35 Rather the purpose of a cap is to avoid creating an advantage to the recipient during the pendency of the relief and to provide a fixed limit on any incentive for non compliance with the efficiency regulations In choosing the number for the cap we believe that the number should permit the firm to operate normally but should be designed to assure competitors that the recipient of relief is not at a competitive advantage If we must err we believe that it should be on the side of caution in order to recognize that competitors are the ones that took all the necessary steps to comply with the standards This is an important matter particularly given the recent promulgation of new efficiency standards for other appliances See 66 Fed Reg 3312 January 12 2001 amended 66 Fed Reg 8745 February 2 2001 clothes washers 66 Fed Reg 3335 January 12 2001 amended 66 Fed Reg 8745 February 2 2001 commercial heating air conditioning and water heating equipment 66 Fed Reg 7169 January 22 2001 amended 66 Fed Reg 8745 February 2 2001 central air conditioners and heat pumps We do not want this decision to have the effect of inviting non meritorious applications for exception from those new standards In this increasingly important area of appliance energy efficiency we realize that the changes required for manufacturers are substantial The availability of exception relief to adjust for serious mis steps toward compliance helps to make the system work properly 4 Nevertheless an exception should be framed in a way that allows a manufacturer only to get back on schedule towards compliance without serious interruptions not to gain advantage over its competitors Accordingly although we believe that DRI is entitled to six months of exception relief from July 1 2001 to December 31 2001 we are limiting the relief as follows i the relief is limited to DRI s side by side refrigerators ii the relief during the period July 2001 through November 2001 for all models combined is limited to a maximum production of 1600 refrigerators in any given month iii the relief for the month of December 2001 is limited to a maximum production of 800 refrigerators 5 and iv the relief is contingent upon the filing of subject to monthly reports due by the 15th of the month after the reporting month listing the number of each model produced in the reporting month and showing DRI s progress in achieving compliance III Conclusion As the foregoing indicates we have concluded that in the absence of exception relief DRI would suffer an unfair distribution of burdens For that reason we have concluded that DRI s exception should be granted with the limitations specified above It Is Therefore Ordered That 1 The Application for Exception filed by Diversified Refrigeration Inc DRI be and hereby is granted in part as set forth in Paragraphs 2 3 and 4 below 2 The deadline for DRI s compliance with the July 1 2001 refrigeration efficiency standards is extended from July 1 2001 to December 31 2001 3 The exception relief is limited to DRI s side by side refrigerators the relief for the months during the period July 2001 through November 2001 for all models combined is limited to a maximum production of 1600 refrigerators in any given month and the relief for the month of December 2001 for all models combined is limited to a maximum production of 800 refrigerators 4 For each month of the exception relief DRI shall file a report showing i the number of non compliant refrigerators produced that month broken down by model number and ii DRI s progress in achieving compliance with the new standards The report shall be due by the 15th of the month immediately following the reporting month 5 This is a final order of the Department of Energy George B Breznay Director Office of Hearings and Appeals Date March 2 2001 4 Sub Zero comments dated August 7 2000 Whirlpool comments dated August 10 2000 GE comments dated August 10 2000 3 We use the term non compliant refrigerators to refer to those that comply with existing standards but will not comply with the new standards 4 No one disputes that the impact of the requested exception on energy conservation goals is de minimis Over 9 million refrigerators are sold each year as explained below we are granting a six month exception for a maximum of 8800 refrigerators 4 Scholars have recognized the important safety valve function that the exceptions process provides See e g Alfred C Aman Jr Administrative Equity An Analysis to Administrative Rules 1982 Duke L J 277 5 The lower limit for December 2001 is based on DRI s submissions in this proceeding indicating that DRI will be ramping up production of compliant models during this month
