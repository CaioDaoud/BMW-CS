NSSDC Archive Plan 2002 2005 NSSDC Archive Plan 2002 2005 Abstract Abstract Intro Introduction Astro Astrophysics space solar Space Solar Physics planetary Planetary Lunar Science Summ Summary Abstract This archive plan shows that NSSDC presently expects to bring several TB year of space science data into its permanent archive over this and the next three years and to make a significant fraction of space physics data network accessible to the research community Introduction NSSDC serves as the permanent archive for most OSS mission data and with its Space Physics Data Facility partner at Goddard as the active archive with data dissemination responsibilities for most space physics data This archive plan summarizes the expected data inflow to NSSDC note the Glossary at the end of this Plan for the years 2002 2005 and is the successor to several earlier plans covering 3 years each The plan shows by year and by mission data volumes flowing to NSSDC as permanent archive and the subset to be made network accessible by NSSDC as an active archive Customers of NSSDC as the permanent archive are NASA s active archives By agreement with the Planetary Data System NSSDC makes PDS provided data accessible to the general public via electronic and offline paths NSSDC s permanent archive environment and its externally accessible data dissemination environment are both in transition The legacy permanent archive presently consists of offline data volumes including 9 track tapes and 3480 tape cartridges holding older data 4 mm and 8 mm tapes and CD R disks holding more recently arrived data CD ROM disks wherein 2 3 copies are in the archive and 10 s to 100 s of copies are held for distribution and non digital media film etc almost always holding old data NSSDC is gradually digitizing at least selected ones of its non digital data sets The new permanent archive consisting of nearline DLT jukeboxes has been growing since mid 2000 To date most data moved to these jukeboxes are new data inflows or data previously user accessible from NSSDC s 12 WORM optical disk jukebox based NDADS system NSSDC provides electronic access to independently usable data from current and recent missions which data are typically not electronically accessible from other sources Two levels of electronic accessibility provided are 1 graphical browse subset retrieve capabilities to CDF formatted Common Data Format data via such systems as CDAWeb and OMNIWeb ASCII output is a user option and to data held as ASCII via FTPBrowser and ATMOWeb and 2 basic file level ftp access to the CDF s underlying CDAWeb etc to the ASCII files accessible through FTPBrowser and to various other mostly ASCII data sets A special client server based interface to IMAGE UDF files is also provided It should be noted that not all relevant active archives had yet provided to NSSDC their estimates of data volumes to be sent to NSSDC for permanent archiving in 2004 and 2005 by spacecraft However because much information is in hand we decided to bring online an incomplete version of this archive plan and will update it as additional information becomes available in the coming weeks Astrophysics NASA s astrophysics data environment is primarily characterized as a set of Science Archive Research Centers SARC which provide electronic access to NASA and some non NASA mission data along with documentation about the data and tools for accessing and using the data These include the High Energy Astrophysics SARC HEASARC at Goddard for gamma ray and X ray data and the Multimission Archive at Space Telescope Science Institute MAST for ultraviolet and optical data Long wavelength data have their SARC functions done by Caltech Infrared Processing and Analysis Center s IPAC Infrared Science Archive IRSA and through 2002 by NSSDC for Goddard oriented long wavelength missions In July 2002 NASA committed to the early creation of a new SARC the Legacy Archive for Microwave Background Data Analysis LAMBDA at Goddard with a focus on MAP and COBE NSSDC s active archiving of long wavelength data will transition to LAMBDA leaving NSSDC with solely a permanent archiving role for astrophysics data As of this writing the future of ADC functionality was being reviewed by GSFC at NASA OSS directive NSSDC s holding of data whose user access is provided by the ensemble of SARCs is for permanent archiving purposes only Only the SARCs are viewed as NSSDC s customers for these data while the SARCs in turn are expected to provide all needed user access and support NSSDC still holds old legacy data not supported by any SARC yet Such legacy data are currently held offline but are community visible through the web accessible NSSDC Master Catalog and may be ordered from NSSDC Discussions on the disposition of such data are being pursued between NSSDC and the relevant SARCs The only astrophysics data arriving at NSSDC as a permanent archive are from the SARCs or with a SARC as an intermediary between a spaceflight project and NSSDC and from the ADC HEASARC is expected to provide the following data volumes GB 2002 2003 2004 2005 ASCA 0 520 0 0

agreement with the project The increase in archiving volume of XMM Newton data results from a recent agreement between HEASARC and the project that HEASARC would archive non US Guest Observer data in addition to US GO data MAST is expected to provide the following GB or in the case of GALEX to facilitate the flow of data 5 TB of catalog and final data products from the project to MAST and to NSSDC

start in 2003 with no other IRSA to NSSDC data flows during the 2002 3 interval The expectation was that 0 5 TB of 2MASS final full sky calibrated data will flow actually from the 2 MASS project to NSSDC in 2003 We await current input from IRSA regarding 2002 5 flows The flow of data into NSSDC from LAMBDA will be 2 GB year for 2002 2005 for SWAS and 2 GB year starting in 2003 for MAP These had been the estimates of flows to NSSDC as a SARC Summarizing these astrophysics data inflows to NSSDC we have 2002 2003 2004 2005 HEASARC 430 1565 1875 2055 MAST 91 91 1110 2090 IRSA 0 500 tbd tbd

s plan since experience shows that FAST and Cluster data flows are larger than then anticipated The IU independently usable estimates are somewhat decreased owing to smaller numbers for ISTP and Cluster In addition to inflows from these active missions NSSDC expects to continue receiving 60 GB year of data from the ISIS ionogram digitization project at Goddard through 2003 2003 inflow will be ISIS similar data from the Alouette 2 spacecraft The only other likely voluminous inflow is from the Atlas 1 Imaging Spectrometric Observatory ISO at 10 GB each for 2002 and 2003 Folding these in a

279 The Solar Data Analysis Center SDAC at Goddard functions much like an astrophysics SARC for the solar remote sensing data from current and recent solar missions except that the voluminous helioseismology data are managed at and made electronically accessible from Stanford U Key current missions supported at SDAC are SOHO and TRACE Data from these are managed by SDAC in both an online accessible mode and an offsite media storage mode Copies will be provided to NSSDC after conclusion of those missions Planetary and Lunar Science NSSDC s main source of these data is the multi nodal Planetary Data System PDS PDS publishes data sets in that they accumulate data and needed supporting material onto media that are peer reviewed for adherence to PDS standards and for their correct and independent usability These data arrive at NSSDC on CD ROM or on DVD and are not made electronically accessible by NSSDC because PDS provides such access NSSDC provides electronic access to selected popular images as part of its support of the general public this will not be further considered herein We expect to receive the following data volumes from PDS in the coming years CD ROM CD R DVD DVD

NSSDC ingested during 2002 1078 CD R s holding Magellan Synthetic Aperture Radar EDR data These replaced thousands of magnetic tapes previously sent to NSSDC If we assume that each CD has 620 MB and each DVD has 4 GB then in the years 2002 2003 we expect inflows of 1600 GB and 200 GB respectively We cannot yet project for 2004 and 2005 Summary The following shows the total data volumes GB expected to flow to NSSDC in the coming years and the subsets of these volumes that NSSDC will plan to make network accessible to the research community Note that NSSDC s magnetic disk needs are a combination of these new data plus disk space to make still important but still offline data network accessible 2002 2003 2004 2005 Total Disk Total Disk Total Disk Total Disk Astrophysics 523 0 2160
