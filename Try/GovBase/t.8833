Hot Paper in Physics the Thomson ISI citation service reports that an August 2001 SNO paper is the most cited report in Physics in the last two years This 2001 report from Physical Review Letters was cited 56 times in current journal articles indexed by Thomson ISI during May June 2003 With its latest two month total this paper currently stands as the most cited report in physics published in the last two years aside from reviews The paper s closest competition in fact comes from two other reports from the same group of authors the Sudbury Neutrino Observatory SNO collaboration Three SNO reports on neutrinos now occupy the 1 2 and 3 spots among the Top Ten most cited papers in physics July 2003 INPA has another new member Saul Perlmutter s and Laura Nelson s daughter Noa arrived July

2003 Saul Perlmutter leader of the Supernova Cosmology Project was named California Scientist of the Year by the California Science Center in recognition of his work showing the acceleration of the Universe s expansion He will be honored at a reception and banquet in Los Angeles on May 8 at the Science Center March 2003 Gil Shapiro s family made a memorial gift to INPA of a new loveseat for the INPA common room They felt it a fitting tribute to Gil who had an inclination to sleep during talks and would have approved of providing a comfortable seat for like minded individuals The http inpa

Information The LBL Institute for Nuclear and Particle Astrophysics INPA unites LBL research in astrophysics including solar neutrinos cosmic rays dark matter supernovae cosmic background radiation and theoretical astrophysics Because astrophysical events including the very origin of the Universe are governed by the physics of nuclei and particles cooperative research in these disciplines is especially appropriate The INPA brings together experimenters and theorists with common scientific goals and shared techniques that transcend divisional boundaries INPA geninfo html 1 purpose INPA
