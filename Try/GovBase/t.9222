Atmospheric Administration NOAA initiated a sediment characterization study in the lower Duwamish River The study focused on determining levels of polychlorinated biphenyls PCBs and polychlorinated terphenyls PCTs found in river sediments in the study area The duw map pdf study area extends from near the south tip of Harbor Island upstream to river mile 7 which is about a mile upstream of the upper navigational turning basin The National Marine Fisheries Service NMFS part of NOAA issued a listing under the Endangered Species Act which may affect how natural resource issues are addressed in Elliott Bay and the lower Duwamish River Further information is available from the http www nwr noaa gov NMFS NW Region web site The Environmental Conservation Division of the Northwest Fisheries Science Center NMFS has conducted other http research nwfsc noaa gov ec ecotox investigations related to salmonids and sediment quality thresholds for various PAHs PCBs and tributyltin EPA ECOLOGY REMEDIAL ACTIVITIES On March 19 1998 NOAA petitioned EPA to conduct an assessment of the lower Duwamish River The assessment process is used to determine which sites qualify for the National Priorities List NPL The NPL prioritizes sites for full scale environmental investigation and possible cleanup See EPA fact sheet epa samp pdf EPA Sampling In August 1998 EPA issued another fact sheet epa 8 98 pdf EPA Sampling 8 98 fact sheet describing their planned sampling activities and announcing the availability of the sampling plan In August 2000 EPA and the Department of Ecology issued a eb epa3 pdf news release announcing a public meeting and public comment period on the Lower Duwamish Waterway Site In December 2000 EPA issued a epa 1200 pdf public notice proposing to add the Lower Duwamish Waterway to the National Priorities List Contact http www epa gov region10 EPA Region 10 for further information on EPA s remedial activities in the Elliott Bay Duwamish River environment
