Illustration of the metaphor of a tug of war in negotiation In times of increasing conflict over natural resource decisions the ability to work out agreements satisfactory to all interested parties has become an invaluable skill Recognizing this USGS social scientists have developed training courses based on research they have conducted over the past fifteen years Twelve participants from state and federal agencies augmented their knowledge and skills in a course held at the USGS Fort Collins Science Center CO November 18 20 The course Advanced Negotiation Training for Natural Resource Professionals provides instructions and hands on practice and evaluation in diagnosing and planning multi party long term negotiations selecting and assembling an effective negotiations team and productively applying technical information in the negotiation process http www fort usgs gov products training training asp More information about the Basic and Advanced Natural Resource Negotiation

Conservation Reserve Program remains the largest environmental program administered by the U S Department of Agriculture with enrollment exceeding 34 million acres nationwide Because improvement in program performance is an important goal of CRP administrators participants input on how the program is working on the ground is an important factor in its evaluation At the request of the USDA Farm Service Agency the USGS completed a national survey of over 2 000 landowners holding active CRP contracts in 2001 The survey results describe participant opinions about personal effects of the CRP
