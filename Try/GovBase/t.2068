Bump Bonding Bump Bonding The BTeV baseline pixel detector like most other pixel systems being developed for high energy physics experiments is based on a design relying on a hybrid approach With this approach the readout chip and the sensor array are developed separately and the detector is constructed by flip chip mating of the two This method offers maximum flexibility in the development process choice of fabrication technologies and the choice of sensor materials However it requires the availability of a highly reliable reasonably low cost fine pitch flip chip attachment technology There are several bonding technologies which may be suitable for this These include indium bumps Pb Sn solder bumps fluxless solder bumps and anisotropic conductive films ACF or tapes Given the fact that we are mostly dealing with dies for the readout chip so far and that our pitch is extremely fine we chose to go with indium bumps Even though our recent contacts showed that Pb Sn solder has been made to work at various places for a fine pitch and they are a bit cheaper than indium bumps Both pure In and Pb Sn solder appear to meet our requirements for providing adequate electrical and mechanical bonds at 50 microns pitch Our task is to start qualifying vendors with facilities to provide such services to outside customers and demonstrate the quality and yield of their bump bonding services by providing bumping and bonding of a large number of dummy pixel detectors For this purpose we have designed a dummy assembly module consisting of an upper and a lower array As much as possible the two arrays will be close to the size of the real sensor and readout chip that we will have SEM photos of indium bumps deposited at AIT on FPIX1 pixel readout chip pict and plot Z001 JPG FPIX1 pict and plot Z002 JPG FPIX1 pict and plot Z004 JPG Indium Bumps pict and plot Z005 JPG Indium Bump pict and plot Z006 JPG FPIX1 pict and plot Z007 JPG FPIX1 pict and plot fermic device jpg BTeV CMS daisy chained patterns Picture showing wafer layout of joint BTeV CMS daisy chained patterns To be fabricated at MCNC UNITIVE pres and doc Review of results on solder bumps ppt Simon Kwan s presentation on results on solder bumps at MCNC April 11 2000 pres and doc Issues and corrective action ppt Simon Kwan s presentation on issues related to solder bumps at MCNC April 11 2000 Picture showing pict and plot 25micron chip sub 2 tif flip chip mated dummy test parts from MCNC using Eutectic solder bumps Four pictures showing the pict and plot defect joins returned by Fermi jpg separated dummy chip and substrate that was previously flip chip mated The black dots are solder bumps clear pads are non wet UBM pads The upper left picture shows the bumped chip The remaining three show the same mating substrate in each case showing non wets in the lower left quadrant The presence of non wets on one quadrant of the substrate is probably due to contamination or debris on the substrate http fnlib2 fnal gov MARION AAG 1311 Selcuk Cihingir s write up of his talk given in Florence June 28 2000 pict and plot Pictures including some not listed here pres and doc Presentations and Documents welcome html Back to RHVD Home Page Last Update 12 13 00 By David Christian Send questions to mailto swalk fnal gov swalk fnal gov
