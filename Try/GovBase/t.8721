dedicated group of astronomers and programmers who work at NASA s Goddard Space Flight Center Some members of this jolly group spend their days recovering data from old docs dict qz html X ray X ray and docs dict ei html gamma ray gamma ray docs dict qz html satellite satellites and making it available to the public for use again Others spend their time helping various astronomers plan and interpret observations obtained with current satellite missions such as XMM INTEGRAL and the Rossi X ray Timing Explorer docs dict qz html RXTE RXTE and others plan for upcoming missions such as Swift Astro E2 and GLAST All of these activities entail astronomers and programmers working together to develop sophisticated computer software and databases which are made accessible via the web Since 1996 we have provided educational materials and resources to a broader community of students teachers and the general public who wish to know more about the wondrous Universe The OXPOG staff Left to Right

Beth Jacob Georgia de Nolfo Hans Krimm Contributors not all are pictured above Jim Lochner Imagine the Universe s numero uno He keeps it running and keeps everyone happy He studies X ray binaries in his spare time when not listening to Car Talk Nick White Director of the Lab for High Energy Astrophysics as well as Group Leader for the Office of Guest Investigator Programs i e the HEASARC He s in control but not necessarily in charge Meredith Bene Our second and fourth web master extraordinaire She s one of the happiest people we know likely due to all that Joan Baez and Peter Paul Mary that she listens to For a short time she wore 3 D glasses for Goddard s Visualization lab but is back to cheer us up again Koji Mukai Responsible for running our Ask a High Energy Astronomer service Also

A technologist who helps the visiting scientists at the HEASARC analyze data from their favorite satellite Mike is no longer looking for a ticket to Antarctica but hopes his son can get a summer job at McDonalds there George Gliba Helps sort through all those Ask a High Energy Astronomer questions for the archive The person we go to for observational astronomy questions He also sends out all those CDs posters and booklets Beth Jacob Education lead for cosmic ray projects and moving force behind the Cosmic and Heliospheric Learning Center Sara Mitchell Our newest team member She can present a workshop film a commercial fix a website wire a house and hunt down a bargain She can even work a Macintosh Amanda Cook Our energetic undergraduate intern during Summer 2003 We worked her to

event horizon of life Richard s goal is to forecast the weather on a neutron star and buy his own personal refrigerator magnetar His philosophy of life is always see the world through gravitationally lensed glasses Georgia de Nolfo Our second token cosmic ray astrophysicist She works on ACE and TIGER HNX and is very enthusiastic about education and public outreach Ilana Harrus Purveyor of all things French Ilana is fit enough to ride her bicycle around a neutron star although she would complain about all the uphills Eric Christian Our token cosmic ray astrophysicist and in 2001 was docs
