Enhance Functionality Need This program addresses control and interoperability at the unit process level Over the past two decades information technology has dramatically increased the intelligence of the upper levels of manufacturing systems In the next twenty years this intelligence will reach down to the factory floor as individual machines become much smarter able to communicate more broadly to integrate more easily to predict results and avoid or diagnose mistakes to use extensive in process gaging and to use scientific models to optimize productivity These trends echoed in the IMTR Roadmap have great potential to decrease time and cost to market improve quality and increase productivity However they require a seamless flow of information and total integration throughout the enterprise and today in the words of one workshop attendee all the links are broken Open architecture control a common architecture of system components and interfaces is the key to connecting the links and to realizing the benefits of increased intelligence in manufacturing processes Industry is looking to NIST to play a leadership role in working with them to turn the vision of open architecture control into reality and in much less time than the normative standards process typically takes We don t have time to wait NIST must play a leadership role in resolving these standards problems Daimler Chrysler In this program we are responding to this challenge by establishing testbeds and using them to help industry validate the architecture and interface standards needed to get open architecture controls for machine tools robots and automated metrology equipment into the marketplace We will also develop conformance tests that companies can use to make sure that the systems they buy work together How much is the current lack of interoperability costing U S industry Taking industrial robots as an example the total installed system cost is typically 3 to 5 times the cost of the robot itself 1999 Robotics Industry Forum In a 1 B U S robot market 1999 this equates to 2 B to 4 B of added costs If only 25 of these were attributable to software integration and if they could be reduced by 50 through the development and use of standardized open architecture controllers the potential savings would be 250 M to 500 M per year A look at cell integration costs in the aerospace industry paints a picture of comparable potential savings 10 M of capital equipment takes 100 person years to integrate Boeing data Ultimately success for this program means a dramatic reduction of these software integration costs and market availability of commercial open architecture controllers and software modules that improve manufacturing equipment productivity and product quality The time is ripe for open architecture control standardization Globalization of manufacturing operations is creating new pressures for common programming and integration solutions from vendors around the world Interoperability and programming problems are gaining the attention of upper management as time to market becomes even more critical Large users of automated equipment esp automotive and aerospace companies are working to coordinate their efforts to solve these problems The commercial open architecture control market is relatively small but growing rapidly favorable conditions for achieving significant impact Goals By 2005 Develop and validate the following key interface standards and conformance tests for those standards to achieve interoperability of control systems for machines on the factory floor with design and planning systems with factory data networks and with each other STEP NC ISO 14649 for machine tool controls OMAC Open Modular Architecture Controls Users Group API for machine tool controls MAA Common Machine Interface for coordinate measuring machine controls ANSI CAM I Dimensional Measurement Interface Standard Part 1 and Part 2 for metrology equipment programming and integration ANSI RIA R15 03 Factory Data Network Interface for Robot Control Systems for robot controls AWS A9 4 Network Based Connection of Shop Floor Robot Welding Equipment Approach Our approach is to realize interoperability by facilitating and participating in industry efforts to standardize open architecture control Interoperability requires three steps Vendor agreement to a common architecture that defines system components and their relationships Development and implementation of valid interface specifications and Establishment of conformance tests for determining whether products faithfully implement the specifications and achieve plug and play operation We are involved in each of these steps We hold workshops in collaboration with industry and government agencies to identify the most pressing interoperability problems We facilitate and participate in industry efforts to develop suitable architectures as a basis for interface specifications We establish testbeds with real manufacturing equipment to implement and test candidate specifications In cases where conformance tests are needed to ensure interoperability we work with industry members to develop them Currently we are currently working closely with groups representing three market sectors These include The Open Modular Architecture Controller OMAC and Hexapod Users Groups for machine tools the Robotics Industries Association RIA and American Welding Society AWS for robot control and robotic welding and the The Automotive Industry Action Group AIAG and the Metrology Automation Association MAA for automated metrology equipment We are also collaborating with the Integrated Manufacturing Technology Initiative to identify and address control related problems that need to be solved to achieve the long sought goal of First Part Correct Through this program we hope to accelerate the implementation and commercial availability of controllers with advanced capabilities and to reduce controller life cycle costs due to easier integration of controller components and increased competition among controller component vendors This benefits U S controller vendors and users differentially by helping them achieve a competitive advantage in implementing and applying advanced capabilities at lower costs Progress Robotic Industries Association R15 04 Communication Committee Reconvened The Robotic Industries Association RIA R15 04 Communication and Information Committee was reconvened as a result of interest in standards for network integration of robot controllers arising from the NIST RIA workshop series on open architecture control The committee is comprised of robot vendors Fanuc Robotics North America Kuka Development Laboratories robot users General Motors Ford and third parties B2D Solutions Radix Controls Pilz Automation NIST RIA At a meeting held April 19 in Detroit MI the group discussed publishing a technical report derived from the communication requirements in GM s General Requirements Specification for robot controllers These include Ethernet TCP IP and FTP with additional classification of robot controller data files intended to enable uniform file upload download and compare UDC across vendors The draft report has been circulated and was presented at the RIA Robots and Vision conference in Chicago in June 2001 Interoperability Testing Tools for Metrology Equipment Successfully Demonstrated Shortening time to market is a strategic imperative for U S manufacturers in an increasingly competitive global marketplace Achieving a seamless flow of data from CAD part models to equipment on the factory floor is a key requirement to shorten product cycles In the area of metrology equipment one of the key interfaces that NIST has identified to focus on is the interface between the metrology hardware the coordinate measuring machine for example and the control system for that hardware NIST is working with the Metrology Automation Association to develop a standard for this interface which is called the Common Machine Interface CMI Industry is setting the specifications and NIST is providing testing tools At the SIMA Annual Review in July NIST researchers teamed with one of the leading manufacturers of metrology equipment LK Metrology to demonstrate the CMI test suite John Horst Hui min Huang and Harry Scott of NIST and Dave Smith of LK Metrology successfully presented and demonstrated the CMI test suite effort Developers of the demonstrated system also included Keith Stouffer Joe Falco and Tom Kramer Demonstrated were the NIST developed common sender and receiver utilities a common test artifact and an implementation of CMI on a Coordinate Measurement Machine by LK The demonstration of the test suite included the transmission of a CMI compliant test file from the NIST AMSANT lab to the facility at LK in the U K execution of the file on the CMM at LK to inspect features on the test part monitoring and collection of status information and review of test log files with preliminary analysis tools The demonstration included transmission of live video and audio over the internet from the LK location in England to the AMSANT Lab at NIST Other major participants in defining the CMI include Brown Sharpe and Zeiss NIST Encourages Harmonization of Conflicting Standards for Dimensional Inspection In developing standards for closely related activities it is inevitable that separate standards groups will rework the same turf To make interoperable standards when turf overlaps the groups involved must harmonize their efforts At a meeting hosted by Brown Sharpe in Wixom Michigan November 14 16 representatives of three MEL divisions ISD MSID and PED participated in an effort to harmonize a developing ISO standard ISO 10303 AP 219 Dimensional Inspection with an existing CAM I ANSI standard undergoing revision Dimensional Measuring Interface Standard Version 4 0 Other attendees included vendors users and federal laboratories representing both standards committees Good progress was made in achieving mutual understanding The goal of achieving semantic equivalence in areas common to the two standards was adopted and a model was developed providing semantic equivalence of inspection features NIST is playing a proactive role having initially proposed this harmonization effort and having committed to providing an EXPRESS schema for DMIS 4 0 and a DMIS to STEP converter to enable interoperability Workshops on Open Architecture Control for Robotics NIST
