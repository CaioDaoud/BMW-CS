Journal Forum Washington DC December 4 2003 Good afternoon Thank you Sonja for that very nice introduction and for your invitation for the third year in a row I am very honored to be here today and to join this group of people who are so interested in the future of the farm sector and agriculture in this country And it is great to see so many friends around the room and to talk to you about some of the critical issues that impact agriculture I was pleased to hear that you were going to have Andrew Natsios with you later today the Administrator of the Agency for International Development Because our two agencies our Department and their agency are key partners in so many things whether it s or food assistance programs or other programs which have been keep to promoting peace and stability in

as Sonja said I was fortunate to be able to view many of these efforts about three weeks ago when I was traveling to Uzbekistan Afghanistan and Iraq During that trip we met with ministers of agriculture we met with other people in leadership positions in those countries including President Karzai in Afghanistan and members of the Governing Council in Iraq We also met with farmers and students we saw many food and agriculture and resource projects that are underway And we saw programs that use our food aid to provide employment for women in bakeries in Afghanistan for example where we saw U S wheat in food aid bags to provide employment for poor women while also providing food for the Afghan people Food and agriculture have suffered from conflict neglect under investment poor policies and exploitation in these countries And so it s critical that we do all we can to help rebuild the economies of these nations for our national security and for our economic interests And it was clear during our trip that agriculture is central to those efforts It is the cornerstone to helping end decades of struggle and the beginning of a new hopeful future USDA continues to be on the frontline of many national and international issues Here in the U S one of the great success stories of 2003 would have to be the farm economy which is strongly recovering along with the U S economy and many economies around the world We expect farm income in 2003 to be a record high a sharp rebound from 2002 and well above the long term average Net cash farm income is forecast to be 65 billion up 33 percent over 2002 This reflects broad improvement across virtually all segments of the sector At the same time we expect consumer prices to remain steady and food will continue to be a good bargain for the nation s consumers Part of this improved income outlook is due to significantly brighter export prospects Exports for 2003 are estimated at 56 2 billion while the forecast for next year for 2004 is 59 5 billion just short of the all time record of 60 billion set in 1996 It would represent the fifth consecutive year of recovery of our export markets The demand for farm products is being spurred by the President s tax cuts low interest rates and inflation and a decline in the value of the dollar Expanding payrolls and declining unemployment in the coming year will further bolster food demand While we will release updated and more detailed forecasts at our Outlook Conference in February which I know you will all come back to Washington for farm income and exports should continue strong for the year Timely and efficient implementation of the 2002 Farm Bill has been a contributing factor to the brighter income picture Government payments will total about 19 7 billion in 2003 USDA has implemented all of the major commodity program provisions under the Farm Bill and we did it in conjunction with implementing major disaster relief as well I think it s safe to say that our employees both here in Washington and around the country have done yeomen s work and deserve credit for a job well done This farm bill also contains the first ever energy title in a farm bill We have through that title invested 21 million in grants under the Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency Improvement Program and 45 million in biobased and bioenergy related businesses Now as you ve been watching the debate over the last couple of months the Energy bill has not fared as well as we would have liked We were disappointed that Congress did not finish work on the Energy Bill Our efforts at helping farmers and ranchers meet more of their own energy needs and those of our nation would be enhanced if Congress passes the pending Energy Bill I think most of you know Keith Collins who is our Chief Economist at USDA He analyzed the bill and found that it would provide significant benefits to farmers ranchers and rural communities The Renewable Fuels Standard which sets minimum ethanol production at 5 billion gallons could nearly double the number of bushels of corn for ethanol production from 1 billion bushels today to about 2 billion by 2012 under the proposed Energy Bill This would provide a boost to corn and sorghum prices by 10 to perhaps 30 cents per bushel It would also have spillover effects to other crop prices as farmers shift acreage to corn and sorghum The overall effect would be positive for net farm income by an estimated 2 to 4 billion by the year 2012 Also The phase out of MTBE would create additional demand for ethanol But even without the Energy Bill ethanol is doing very well in this country We re seeing corn use in ethanol production is expected to be up 30 percent this year and the phase out of MTBE called for by 17 states will continue to expand this demand There are currently 74 ethanol plants in operation with 16 more under construction Just yesterday we celebrated a major accomplishment as the President came to U S Department of Agriculture his first visit to sign the Healthy Forests Restoration Act that the Congress just passed The President s Healthy Forests Initiative and the supporting legislation will improve our ability to make our nation s forests less vulnerable to catastrophic fires like the ones we saw throughout Southern California Just as the USDA helps farmers and ranchers be better stewards of their land the Healthy Forests Initiative will give us new tools to better manage the lands that are under federal ownership and to help reduce the risk of catastrophic wildfires This year USDA and Department of the Interior treated a record 2 6 million acres of hazardous fuels across the nation we funded about 1 200 community fire plans and we maintained a wildland firefighting workforce of nearly 18 000 personnel Another area of continuing focus at USDA is food safety In July we released a food safety vision document that outlines key steps to improve food safety and protect public health This includes a research agenda that prioritizes needs to maximize available resources strategies to improve workforce training streamlined implementation of technology identification of best management practices and risk analysis coordination This comprehensive approach to food safety has contributed to major reductions in food borne pathogens We have seen a 66 percent reduction over the past six years in the rate of Salmonella in poultry meat a 70 percent reduction in samples that test positive for Listeria and continued reductions in the incidence of E coli O157 H7 A long similar lines we worked aggressively and successfully with Canada to address the single case of BSE that was found in May in Canada This issue has implications to both food safety and animal health and certainly has strongly impacted the trade between our two countries In the coming year we will continue with Canada and Mexico and with the OIE to ensure that there is a consistent international response to potential future cases of BSE We want to ensure that the best and most recent scientific information underpins all of our regulations A growing public health concern in this country is the deepening obesity crisis I was pleased to see that this was a major focus of your discussions this morning Nearly two thirds of American adults are overweight up 50 percent from a decade ago 31 percent of adults are obese double the rate in 1980 If the trends do not change it will be 40 percent by the year 2010 Among children about 15 percent are overweight or obese more than double the level of 6 percent in 1980 One of the fastest growing categories of overweight Americans is the morbidly obese whose numbers increased four fold since 1986 This crisis is costing the lives of about 300 000 Americans every year and financially it s costing our national about 123 billion a year in lost productivity and health care costs Inaction is not an option and USDA is a key participant in the President s Healthier US Initiative For instance USDA produces valuable research on nutrition and foods consumer trends and behaviors USDA nutrition programs touch the lives of one in six Americans every day Food Stamps school lunches school breakfasts and the Women Infants and Children program Through these programs in addition to food we provide nutrition education to key audiences We are working with the Department of Health and Human Services on the Dietary Guidelines for Americans and with the advisory committee that s been appointed to review them Related to this our Center for Nutrition Policy and Promotion is reviewing the Food Guide Pyramid which is a key nutrition education tool While we struggle to address the causes and effects of obesity many of the world s people still suffer from hunger and malnutrition In June of 2002 at the World Food Summit meeting in Rome delegates there reiterated the goal of reducing by half the more than 800 million hungry people around the world by the year 2015 In my speech at that meeting I committed that U S would hold a conference on using technology to increase agricultural productivity and reduce global hunger And I hosted such a meeting a Ministerial Conference on Agricultural Science and Technology this just past June in Sacramento California This conference was a major accomplishment for USDA and the Administration s and our international trade and development efforts and it will remain a focus of our work in 2004 In all we had a total of about 1 000 participants 119 at the ministerial level attended including ministers of agriculture science and technology of health of trade environment and commerce just to name a few It was one of the largest most diverse gatherings of decision makers from around the world ever to address the issue of global hunger In Sacramento we identified priorities for guiding the use of resources and partnerships in key areas These include making research and technology more accessible to farmers around the world expanding the local knowledge base promoting partnerships and facilitating the benefits of technology through supportive partnerships We are hard at work on follow on activities and regional conferences that will support these priorities in the coming year Sacramento was a recent stop on the road addressing the needs of developing countries that included Doha Qatar and the launch of the WTO trade negotiations Monterey Mexico and the International Conference on Financing for Development Rome and the 2002 World Food Summit and Johannesburg Africa and the World Summit on Sustainable Development We are working with partners such as the U S Trade Representative on an agenda to benefit developing countries and we are working with them to expand markets for American agriculture The World Trade Organization negotiations continue in Geneva there s a key meeting that will take place on December 15 This is despite the inability to reach consensus on a ministerial communiqu in Cancun We in the U S stand ready to negotiate an aggressive WTO agreement The recent ministerial meeting in Miami has helped move us a little closer toward the creation of the Free Trade Area of the Americas And achieving such a broad trade area would be truly historic It would form the largest free trade zone in the world with more than 800 million consumers and 13 trillion in GDP The Bush administration has also announced its intentions to pursue several additional free trade initiatives including Free Trade Agreements with Colombia Peru Ecuador and Bolivia as well as with Panama The commitment to conclude the Central American Free Trade Agreement or what is known as CAFTA by the end of the year And accelerated negotiations with the Dominican Republic were announced with the intention to join it with the CAFTA next year One final issue I would like to briefly discuss this afternoon is USDA s continuing focus on the President s Management Agenda Earlier this year we put out a press release that probably most of you didn t see But it announced that we had for the first time ever a clean audit of USDA Now that s probably kind of dry not very interesting to most Americans but in reality it is an important step at USDA and it took a lot of effort And I think the reflection of the level of service we provide to American agriculture our accountability with taxpayer funds and our efficiency in our way we run our programs We re going to continue to implement Budget Performance Integration to ensure that our programs are performing as they should be as well as other good government efforts such as recovery of erroneous payments One area of particular focus under the President s Management Agenda will be the expansion of electronic government or what we call e government One of the things that I was most surprised about when I returned to USDA after having been gone almost exactly eight years was how little had changed in terms of the amount of technology that had been integrated into the systems And that is why I felt it was so important to hire a top notch CIO from the private sector to address how we can better serve agriculture through the use of technology Agriculture as you all know is an enterprise that is constantly evolving and I want USDA to have the kind of expertise that will help make us more responsive with the programs and services we provide As you know we have roughly 110 000 employees and collectively we produce mountains and I mean mountains of data including forms charts maps and publications We are working to better integrate and coordinate that information and to make our technology as friendly as possible for end users whether they be farmers consumers or our employees The purpose is not only to give the public better access to our programs and the information we produce but to ensure that it s information that works together in a way that is most useful For instance farmers under our new system would be able to overlay data sets onto maps of their local area to help assist in their planting decisions This is an ambitious project for USDA but I think it is one that will put USDA at the forefront of e government and propel this Department into the 21st century USDA is working hard every day to help position American agriculture for the future not just in 2004 but in the years to come after that The theme of your Forum today Success or Survival helps remind us of the future we are all working toward one in which American agriculture does not merely survive but thrives I want to thank you all again for the opportunity to be here I always enjoy visiting with this group and I will be happy to respond to any comments or questions you might have Thanks again Applause Farm Journal Forum Q A Q Question inaudible SECRETARY VENEMAN Well you know the situation in Europe is something we ve been working on almost since the day we walked into the Department And I know I see Gus Schumacher here and I know the previous administration worked very hard on this issue and what do we do about the fact that these biotechnology regulations and traceability and labeling regulations are really going to be regulations that impair trade I think one of the reasons and they are going to be very difficult to implement I think one of the reasons they have yet to be implemented by the EU is because know that And its not just our companies that are complaining or our exporters that are complaining it is those companies in the EU that are selling in to the market that are going to have to implement it as well As you know we filed a WTO case on the biotechnology regulations themselves the traceability and labeling continue to be a problem we continue to look at every avenue available You ree right I cannot tell you what the ultimate strategy will be here today I can tell you the U S government is absolutely committed to continue to work on this issue and to work closely with industry Certainly USTR has been very engaged along with us and the State Department in trying to address these issues I know that industry itself has done a lot of industry to industry work with their counterpart organizations and will continue to do that Q Question inaudible regarding CAFTA Agreement and the effect on sugar SECRETARY VENEMAN Well as you know we have to operate the sugar program to keep prices at a certain level so we hopefully don t take sugar into inventory and we have economists that are working very closely with the CAFTA negotiators looking at how much additional access could be provided without impacting the operation of our overall sugar program So we are very engaged on that issue along with our USTR counterparts Q Question inaudible regarding Conservation Security Program SECRETARY VENEMAN This has been one of the more difficult programs to implement in the farm bill And I have to say it is not for lack of trying that the rule is not yet out First of all unlike some of the provisions of the 2002 Farm Bill this particular provision was left very open in terms of how it would operate So we first began by going out with a group of listening sessions we talked to a lot of people we got a lot of input We then went out with an Advanced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking to again get more input into how did people think this program ought to be put together and at the same time recognizing that we have a limited amount of funding and this year we don t know yet what that total amount will be although we have a proposed omnibus at this point in time We have gone back and forth working with the Office of Management and Budget the rule itself it is in the final stages of negotiation and I can tell you we continue to work diligently on it but I can t give you an exact day when it is going to be released Again some of it depends on what is the amount of money you have to operate the program within fiscal restraints And so well we hoped we would see an omnibus package next week but now reading some of the things in the press today that may be somewhat uncertain Q Question inaudible Laughter SECRETARY VENEMAN We did sign this year a joint agreement with NASA because interestingly enough NASA is giving us and we are working very closely with them on a lot of the information data that comes off of the satellites and we signed a joint research agreement with them So when I say it is not my area actually we do work very closely with NASA and it s going to have what we are able to do with them and we have some pilot projects called inaudible really about helping industry integrate all this data it is really quite remarkable how we can truly use some of this kind of information technology that s been developed with completely different sectors and it will be very useful with the agriculture sector Q Question inaudible regarding Country of Origin Labeling SECRETARY VENEMAN Well again COOL is about let me just begin by saying the Country of Origin Labeling for those of you well in this room I guess everybody would know what COOL is but the Country of Origin Labeling was something that was in the Farm Bill after a tremendous amount of debate it is something as you know that the administration did not support going into the farm bill but nevertheless it became part of the farm bill and so we have taken every step that we have to to implement it Unlike CSP COOL was a very prescriptive statute within the farm bill in the legislative language I should say So it was very specific on what we need to do when So initially last year inaudible the voluntary guidelines and put out the proposed rules just about a month or six weeks ago the statute requires that it be implemented by September 2004 so we have kept all those timetables and worked very closely with our lawyers to make sure that we are implementing according to what the statute requires and so I think USDA has done a good job on that regard Now at the same time while there are a number of ag groups that support country of origin labeling there are also a number of them who do not support it It s one of these classic issues of agriculture not agreeing with itself And we have a lot of issues where agriculture does not agree with itself And so the national cattlemens the pork producers United Fresh Fruits and Vegetables have some of the larger organizations impacted by this law have all come out and said they want a repeal or at least a delay What s happened in the omnibus bill is that there has been a delay on implementation of the bill specified until I think it is two years from the implementation date so it would be September 2006 Now again we don t have the omnibus yet but that s what is pending in the omnibus bill We stand ready to all the steps necessary to implement it according to what our statutory requirements are and I think that s what we ve done Q Question inaudible regarding Australia Free Trade talks SECRETARY VENEMAN Not in detail I know that they are continuing and I don t know that there has been a determination on whether or not we are going to be able to complete those negotiations by the end of this year Obviously we are already into the fourth day of December and the end of the year is growing closer and closer and I have frankly just not had an update from USTR as to whether we are going to meet the proposed deadline by the end of the year to complete those talks Q Question inaudible regarding farm income SECRETARY VENEMAN One of the things that happened this year in terms of there were farmers that didn t signup in time to get the 2002 payments so they were not included in inaudible So there were a lot of payments pushing into 03 so we do have probably do have a larger amount of payments coming out of 2003 because of that You know I think it is important to note that as far as the farm programs go the administration has continued to assume in its budget assumptions that we put forward every year that the farm bill will continue as it has and on schedule And so obviously there are some programs that have been impacted in the farm bill but not the direct subsidies to farmers At this point as I said the budget has reflected what is in the farm bill and I don t see a change in that from the administration s perspective But I can t tell you what the Congress is going to do But obviously there is some increasing pressure on all areas of spending because there is going to be a big effort to try and reduce the deficit as we go forward Q Question inaudible regarding sweetener issues with Mexico SECRETARY VENEMAN Well its not just as you know it s not just the corn sweetener issue but the whole sweetener issue has been an issue with regard to NAFA and how that is all going to be dealt with There has been a tremendous amount back and forth on the whole issue of sugar and sugar access in this country and as a result the legislature the Congress in Mexico took it upon themselves to pass this tax on sweeteners I can tell you we ve had a lot of discussion with the administration on this They thought they could get a repeal We thought we had a repeal at one point But Fox does not have sometimes a lot of control over this Congress just as we don t I mean the President very much wanted to get an energy bill but we weren t able to get one And I must say we haven t tolerated it I guess is the bottom line We haven t been tolerant we have been very forceful in trying to get a repeal but the fact of the matter is this has been a Congressional issue within Mexico Q Question inaudible regarding Locks and Dams on the Mississippi SECRETARY VENEMAN Well we will certainly have some discussions with the Corps of Engineers I know this has been a big issue Again it is very difficult to get money today for new infrastructure I mean there s going to be declining discretionary budgets and when you have to absorb inaudible and it s not Homeland Security or defense that makes it very tough I just went through the budget process myself with regard to our passbacks so I know how hard it really is accessibility htm Accessibility http www usda gov news privacy htm Privacy Security http www usda gov about htm nondis Nondiscrimination http www usda gov
