USTDA will build on the remarkable record achieved last year when the agency accelerated its program to provide a greater breadth and depth of service to U S companies foreign project sponsors and other U S Government agencies USTDA is known for responding rapidly to changing global environments In 2002 USTDA acted quickly to respond to infrastructure priorities and needs within Afghanistan and the other frontline states In these and other developing and middle income countries around the world USTDA strives to provide specific tailored and results oriented responses designed to lead to greater stability through capacity building commercial development and increased employment As a core priority USTDA facilitates development in emerging markets by promoting U S partnerships in high priority overseas projects Last year the cumulative dollar value of export sales associated with USTDA supported projects topped 19 billion although that number only tells part of the story Less directly quantifiable but no less important are the agency s advances in overseas development efforts This year also marks USTDA s first full year in our new headquarters Located just one half block from our old location the new office provides much needed additional space It also allows us to better serve U S businesses and foreign delegates on visits to the Washington D C area through our enlarged and improved Business Center and expanded USTDA resource library We hope that you will visit us at our new headquarters soon As President Bush recently said The work of development is much broader than development aid The vast majority of financing for development comes not from aid but from trade and domestic capital and foreign investment So to be serious about fighting poverty we must be serious about expanding trade USTDA looks forward to continuing to support this vision in 2003 New Press Releases trade press Dec05 03 html 12 05 03 USTDA PARTICIPATES IN INTERAGENCY VISIT TO
