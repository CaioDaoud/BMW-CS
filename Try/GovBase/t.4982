rights or impose any legally binding requirements or obligations on the SSS or the public Nothing in these guidelines affects any otherwise available judicial review of SSS action The SSS will correct information that does not meet its guidelines or those of OMB based on the significance and impact of the correction Any decisions regarding a particular case matter or action will be made based on applicable statutes regulations and requirements Interested parties are free to raise questions and objections regarding the substance of the guidelines and the appropriateness of using them in a particular situation The SSS will consider whether or not the guidelines are appropriate in that situation Factors such as imminent threats to public health or homeland security statutory or court ordered deadlines or other time constraints may limit or preclude applicability of these guidelines II Definitions For purposes of these guidelines the following definitions apply Affected person means anyone including a group organization or corporation as defined in the Paperwork Reduction Act who may benefit or be harmed by the publicly disseminated information including those who are seeking to correct information about themselves and those who use the information Complaint refers to a written communication to the SSS that includes enough information so that the SSS can readily determine the specific information dissemination product the complaining party believes needs correcting how the complaining party is affected by the information dissemination product sought to be corrected the sections of these guidelines or the OMB Guidelines the complaining party believes have not been followed what resolution the complaining party would like and how to get in contact with the comment writer Data are the basic or underlying elements of information All information dissemination products covered by these guidelines are based upon data Additionally covered information dissemination products may contain analysis of the data and conclusions drawn from this analysis Dissemination means SSS initiated or sponsored distribution of information to the public Dissemination does not include distribution limited to government employees or agency contractors or grantees intra or inter agency use or sharing of government information responses to requests for agency records under the Freedom of Information Act the Privacy Act or other similar laws correspondence with individuals or persons archival records other non scientific non statistical general procedural or organizational information and public filings subpoenas or adjudicative processes Influential when used in the phrase influential scientific financial or statistical information means that the SSS can reasonably determine that dissemination of the information will have or does have a clear and substantial impact on important public policies or important private sector decisions Information means any communication or representation of knowledge such as facts or data in any medium or form including textual numerical graphic cartographic narrative or audiovisual forms This definition includes information disseminated from an Internet page but does not include the provision of hyperlinks to information that others disseminate This definition does not include opinions where the presentation makes it clear that what is being offered is someone s opinion rather than an official view Information dissemination product means any book paper map machine readable material audiovisual production or other documentary material regardless of physical form or characteristic that is covered by these guidelines and disseminated to the public as an expression of an official SSS position This definition can include electronic documents CD ROMs or web pages Integrity refers to the security of information protection of the information from unauthorized access or revision to ensure that the information is not compromised through corruption or falsification Non scientific non statistical general procedural or organizational information includes but is not limited to Agency press releases fact sheets press conferences or similar communications in any medium that announce support the announcement or give public notice of information that the SSS has disseminated elsewhere Fact sheets and brochures Speeches Remarks Presentations and their accompanying visual materials Listings of Licensees registrations fees paid Phone directories Job openings Transcriptions or minutes video audio

information k Electronic comment filings Objectivity involves two distinct elements presentation and substance In a substantive sense objectivity involves a focus on ensuring accurate reliable and unbiased information In addition data should have full accurate transparent documentation and error sources affecting data quality should be identified and disclosed to users In a scientific financial or statistical context substantive objectivity means that the original and supporting data shall be generated and the analytic results shall be developed using sound statistical and research methods Presentational objectivity involves a focus on ensuring clarity accuracy completeness and reliability Quality is a term encompassing utility objectivity and integrity Therefore the guidelines sometimes refer to these statutory terms collectively as quality Reproducibility means that the information is capable of being substantially reproduced subject to an acceptable degree of imprecision For information judged to have more influence or important impact the degree of imprecision that is tolerated is reduced With respect to analytic results capable of being substantially reproduced means that independent analysis of the original or supporting data using identical methods would generate similar analytic results subject to an acceptable degree of imprecision or error Transparency refers to practices of describing the data and methods used in developing an information dissemination product in a way that it would be possible for an independent re analysis to occur by a qualified individual or organization Transparency does not require that information be disclosed where disclosure would result in harm to other compelling interests such as privacy trade secrets intellectual property confidentiality protections or public safety Utility refers to the usefulness of the information to its intended users including the public In assessing the usefulness of information that the SSS disseminates to the public the SSS will consider the uses of the information not only from the perspective of the SSS but also from the perspective of the public III Pre Dissemination Information Review and Substantiation Process Beginning October 1 2002 the following process will apply to information dissemination products distributed by the SSS to ensure and maximize the quality objectivity utility and integrity of the information The information dissemination products covered by these guidelines include reports prepared for Congress or required by legislation such as the annual reports of services Information exempt from these guidelines includes information associated with public filings subpoenas or adjudicative processes non scientific non statistical general procedural or organizational information information that is not initiated or sponsored by the SSS information that expresses personal opinions rather than formal agency views information for the primary use of federal employees inter or intra agency contractors or grantees responses to requests made under the Freedom of Information Act the Privacy Act the Federal Advisory Committee Act or similar laws agency correspondence archival records trade secrets intellectual property confidential data or information and non routine or emergency public safety information For each information dissemination product covered by these guidelines every Office shall conduct a pre dissemination review using the standards below Quality will be demonstrated through the incorporation of a methodological section or appendix that describes at a minimum the design and methods used during the creation collection and processing of the data the compilation and or analysis of the data and the pre release review of the information dissemination product for clarity completeness accuracy and reliability Objectivity will be demonstrated by including in the information dissemination product s methodology section or appendix a discussion of other scientifically financially or statistically responsible and reliable alternative views and perspectives if these alternative views or perspectives are not already noted in other sections of the information dissemination product Utility will be demonstrated by the responsible Office incorporating into the methodology section or appendix examples of the use of the information dissemination product These examples could include but are not limited to listing of the legislation requiring the information dissemination product or the specific request for the information dissemination product Integrity is demonstrated by the SSS routine day to day compliance across all operations and processes with relevant data protection and security sections of applicable statues and regulations and therefore does not have to be specifically addressed in information dissemination products covered by these guidelines IV The Complaint and Appeals Process 1 Filing a Complaint Affected persons may seek timely correction of information dissemination products maintained and distributed by the SSS that do not comply with the SSS or OMB s guidelines by completing the Data Quality Comment form that will be found beginning October 1 2002 at https www4 sss gov InfoCorrectionSite dataquality htm Data Quality Comment Form This form can be submitted electronically by clicking on the link found at the end of the form or by printing a copy and mailing it to the Selective Service System National Headquarters ATTN Public and Congressional Affairs Office Arlington Virginia 22209 2425 Initial Correction Request 1 Any person affected by the information SSS publicly disseminates as intended by Section 515 may request the timely correction of that information 2 Any affected person may submit a timely request for correction to the Office of the Director of SSS who will direct the request to the appropriate Directorate Head for consideration 3 The request for correction under Section 515 and these guidelines must Be in writing Clearly explain how the person is an affected person as defined by these guidelines Clearly identify the information dissemination product that needs to be corrected for failure to meet SSS or OMB standards Clearly identify the information within that product alleged to be incorrect Suggest and explain appropriate corrective action including the justifications for the changes or other remedial actions being sought Identify the comment writer and how to contact him or her and Be clearly marked Information Correction Request and addressed to Selective Service System National Headquarters ATTN Public and Congressional Affairs Office Arlington Virginia 22209 2425 The request can also be emailed to information sss gov 4 If the information disseminated by SSS and contested by an affected person was previously disseminated by another Federal agency in virtually identical form then the complaint should be directed to the originating agency 5 Once an Information Correction Request has been received it is SSS intention for the Office Director OD to respond within 60 days beginning at the time of SSS receipt The OD may extend the response period for an additional 30 days if the OD determines an extension is appropriate and promptly provides the requestor the reasons why more time is needed Such reasons may include the need to review multiple records encompassed by a single request or the need to consult with other Federal agencies that have a substantial interest in the information at issue and the change being sought In cases where the SSS disseminates a study analysis or other information prior to the final SSS action or information product requests for correction will be considered prior to the final SSS action or information product in those cases where the SSS has determined that an earlier response would not unduly delay issuance of the SSS action or information product and the complainant has shown a reasonable likelihood of suffering actual harm from the SSS dissemination if the SSS does not resolve the complaint prior to the final SSS action or information product 6 Once received the OD shall initially determine whether the request meets threshold requirements for standing such as whether the request a Is timely b Is from an affected person as defined in these guidelines c Is appropriately directed to SSS d Alleges errors in information subject to correction i e implicates information as defined in these guidelines or e Reasonably describe 1 the information source 2 the information alleged to be incorrect and 3 a suggested remedy including justifications for the remedy being sought f Contains information from the comment writer to facilitate his or her contact for response 7 If the OD determines the request does not satisfy one or more of the threshold requirements for standing the OD will respond to the requester explaining why the request was deficient If the request was deficient due to an insufficient description of the disseminated information source or the information alleged to be incorrect as a matter of discretion the OD may advise the requester what additional clarification is required and provide a reasonable time for a proper clarification to be submitted Otherwise the OD shall determine whether the request for correction has merit as well as the type of remedy that is most appropriate for the alleged error at issue if proven Given the multiple types of information that may be involved as well as the wide range in possible levels of the information s importance a great variety of remedies may be appropriate The OD has discretion to implement the requester s suggested remedy or to choose another remedy the OD deems most appropriate in the given circumstances The OD will respond to the affected person with an explanation of the decisions that were made on both the error at issue and the remedy if any selected to address it 2 Complaint Resolution A determination will be made within 60 days of receipt of the complaint on whether correction is warranted If the request requires more than 60 calendar days to resolve the SSS will inform the complainant that more time is required and indicate the reason why and an estimated decision date The decision on appropriate corrective action will be based upon the nature and timeliness of the information dissemination product involved and such factors as the significance of the correction on the use of the information dissemination product and the magnitude of the correction Inconsequential trivial or frivolous complaints may require no response at all If corrective action is warranted the correction will occur within 60 days of this notification to the complaining party If a correction is warranted the appropriate Office handling the complaint will respond to the complaint in a manner appropriate to the nature and extent of the complaint Examples of appropriate responses include personal contacts via letter or telephone form letters errata notices press releases or mass mailings that correct a widely disseminated error or address a frequently raised complaint 3 Right to Appeal If the person who requested correction does not agree with the initial decision including corrective action if any the person may file an application for review by the SSS within 30 days of the date of the notification of action on the complaint or the corrective action Applications for review must be submitted in writing to the SSS

include a copy of the original complaint and the response thereto and an explanation of how the initial resolution of the complaint or the corrective action was contrary to the SSS or OMB s information quality guidelines Applications for review will be resolved within 60 days The SSS will respond to all requests for appeals within 60 calendar days of receipt If the request requires more than 60 calendar days to resolve the SSS will inform the complainant that more time is required and indicate the reason why and an estimated decision date The SSS in appropriate cases may deny an application for review without providing reasons V Reporting Requirements On an annual fiscal year basis the SSS shall submit a report to the Director of OMB providing information both quantitative and qualitative where appropriate on the number and nature of complaints received regarding compliance with OMB guidelines and how such complaints were resolved The report shall be submitted no later
