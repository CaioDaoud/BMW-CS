Yellowstone National Park in the 1930s The new yellow bus carries 16 to 32 passengers can use an alternative fuel features a low floor and complies with the Americans with Disabilities Act The bus is built on a General Motors T 560 medium duty chassis with a gross vehicle weight of 19 000 26 000 pounds It took three years to design and build Instead of conventional shocks the bus rides on compressed air which is released to lower the bus for boarding It is designed to run on natural gas Eventually similar buses will be manufactured using several optional engines to allow use of alternative fuels like natural gas propane ethanol and biodiesel Its purposes are to protect the national park s pristine environment and reduce our dependence on foreign sources of energy Biodiesel Carries New Weight Premium The National Conference on Weights and Measures NCWM has passed a new definition for premium diesel and the changes are good news for biodiesel Lubricity is now is considered in determining whether a fuel can be classified as a premium diesel fuel Independent tests show just 1 biodiesel can increase the lubricity of petroleum diesel by as much as 65 The NCWM list now includes cetane cold flow properties thermal stability and lubricity This important development makes the positive lubricity benefit of biodiesel a premium attribute The changes will appear in the 2004 NIST Handbook 130 August 2003 Pump Lets Natural Gas Civics Go to Market In 2004 Honda will begin mass marketing natural gas powered Civics that will come with a device to fill the tank in a garage This is the first time an automaker will sell a natural gas vehicle broadly to the public Until now sales have been mostly limited to specialized fleets such as airport vans and university campus vehicles Since 1998 Honda has sold 500 to 1 000 natural gas Civic GX models per year to customers such as the New York Department of Transportation They are popular for commercial fleets that travel short distances and have their own filling stations The drawback to widespread sales has been the lack of an easy reliable way to fuel the vehicles Honda will sell an appliance called Phill with each Civic GX to fill the tank from a home gas line Phill will cost 2 000 but tax credits may knock the end cost down to 1 000 The Civic GX will cost about 20 000 Honda views the market as mostly second and commuter cars Phill made by Toronto based Fuelmaker requires 8 hours to half fill a vehicle good for 100 miles GX owners also can refill at approximately 1 300 natural gas stations nationwide Filling stations that dispense compressed natural gas under pressure can fill a tank in three to five minutes Running a vehicle on natural gas historically costs about 80 of what it costs to run on gasoline Honda views natural gas as a critical bridge to acceptance of hydrogen powered vehicles it expects to sell in large numbers by 2015 By putting Phills in garages Honda hopes people will accept the idea of hydrogen fuel cell generators in their garages later Compared with gasoline natural gas emits 70 less carbon monoxide 87 less nitrogen oxide and 20 less carbon dioxide New E85
