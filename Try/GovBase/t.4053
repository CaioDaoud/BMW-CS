Program C CHIP provides low cost health coverage to uninsured children through age 19 not eligible for HFP or Medi Cal up to 300 of the Federal Income Guidelines When approved by CMS the program will allow counties and other entities to use local funds as a match to draw down unused federal State Children s Health Insurance Program SCHIP funds The counties will use these funds to provide health insurance to additional children using their locally sponsored health plans The program is managed by MRMIB and administered the county C CHIP provides benefits similar to HFP but serves children between 250 percent and 300 percent of the federal poverty level FPL Four pilot counties have implemented C CHIP and are waiting federal approval and another four counties are in the planning stages of their program This program is considered to be innovative in its manner of funding Usually federal funds require a State fund match before funds can be drawn down The C CHIP program when approved will allow counties to match available federal funds originally allocated to California but for which there was no State appropriated match These available federal funds along with county matched funds will provide needed services for children For further information call Janette Lopez at 916 327 6237 http www pacadvantage org Pacific Health Advantage The Health Insurance Plan of California In
