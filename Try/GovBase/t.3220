Maricopa County operates a 24 hour rain stream and weather gage network which provides real time information to the County and many other agencies about rainfall stormwater runoff and weather conditions in Maricopa County This network operates in the National Weather Service ALERT Automated Local Evaluation in Real Time format and is commonly referred to as an ALERT system In addition to rainfall and streamflow gages measure temperature humidity wind speed barometric pressure wind direction and solar radiation The ALERT system uses automatic telemetry gages for data collection This means that the gages transmit their information to the District base computer via VHF radio The computer can then quickly compile the information and display it on video screens The automatic gages are powered by 12 volt batteries which are recharged using small solar panels attached to the top or sides of the gages ALERT and Stormwater Monitoring Station ALERT Gage of the Month The information provided by the ALERT system is important to the District because occasional heavy rainfall can generate stream flows which significantly impact flood control facilities such as dams and channels Each gage is programmed with an alarm setting The alarm is sounded when the measurements reach a certain threshold and the on call hydrologist evaluates and monitors the situation Flood warnings are provided to District observation teams other County departments city emergency management departments and the National Weather Service Public flood warnings and other weather advisories are issued by the National Weather Service Emergencies are declared by the County Emergency Management Agency The ALERT system data is also valuable after a storm The stored data is used to reconstruct a storm event in order to show the origin of flooding problems and to provide data for use in floodplain studies computer modeling of watersheds and design of future flood control structures Currently the District has 275 automatic rain gages 118 automatic stream gages and 19 automatic weather stations throughout Maricopa and neighboring counties In addition to the gages the District actively recruits volunteers to report rainfall at their homes If selected as a volunteer the District provides a clear view rain gage for the home and then each month volunteers mail rainfall information back to the District The information gathered is added to the District s rainfall records and is used to supplement other rain gage readings in the County Currently 100 volunteers are involved in this program Through this site visitors can gather data online The District can also provide additional data not available online for a charge This charge is based on the time taken to collect the information The Flood Control District started the ALERT system in 1980 after the late 1970 s floods Gages were first placed to monitor the major rivers later they were installed on District dams and flood control structures After the 1993 floods the District started placing more gages in washes In addition to operating the ALERT system the District also runs several local Flood Warning Systems These are for the Town of Wickenburg the City of Scottsdale the Town of Fountain Hills and the Skunk Creek vicinity The District also provides information for the Maricopa County Department of Transportation
