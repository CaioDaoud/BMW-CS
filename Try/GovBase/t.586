publish an inventory of laboratory practices in a statistically representative sample of the nation s laboratories Lead the effort to develop national objectives for the Healthy People 2010 focus area on public health infrastructure We are proud of these achievements but find ourselves faced with many future challenges Less than half of the public health workforce have had training in public health Less than half of the state and local public health departments have adequate communications and information systems Less than half of the nation s local public health agencies have the capacity to provide the essential public health services We have no data systems to monitor these alarming trends in the public health infrastructure In summary the nation is faced with a silent crisis in which the nation s public health infrastructure is fragile and the survival of many health departments is in substantial jeopardy To address this crisis PHPPO will recommit in 1998 its efforts to strengthen the public health system through workforce development information system development laboratory improvement and system research and development The lauded Institute of Medicine Report The Future of Public Health was published 10 years ago In 1998 we will reflect back on a decade of progress since the report was published evaluating the impact of our work and recommit to working in partnership with CDC ATSDR colleagues and partners through the U S and globally to strengthen the practice of public health in the community This table contains hyperlinks to people who manage the pages content
