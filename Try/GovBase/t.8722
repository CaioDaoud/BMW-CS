whistleblower is an essential element in the effort to protect the integrity of PHS supported research because researchers do not call attention to their own misconduct Prior to making an allegation of research misconduct a whistleblower should carefully study the policy established by the institution for responding to such allegations to determine what information should be included in the allegation to whom the allegation should be reported what protections are provided for the whistleblower and what role the whistleblower will play in the ensuing proceedings Because of the likelihood of retaliation against the whistleblower the PHS regulation obligates institutions to protect to the maximum extent possible the privacy of those who in good faith report apparent misconduct and to undertake diligent efforts to protect the positions and reputations of those persons who in good faith make allegations A good faith allegation is made with the honest belief that scientific misconduct may have occurred An allegation is not in good faith if it is made with reckless disregard for or willful ignorance of facts that would disprove the allegation On the role of the whistleblower in misconduct proceedings ORI policy states it is the responsibility of the investigative body and ORI not the whistleblower to ensure that the allegation is thoroughly and competently investigated to resolution Therefore once the allegation is made the whistleblower assumes the role of a possible witness in any subsequent inquiry investigation or hearing For purposes of the scientific misconduct proceedings the whistleblower is not the equivalent of a party in a private dispute between an accuser and accused bullet a class regular href nprmreg htm target new NPRM
