web site is provided by the United States Geological Survey s Earthquake Hazard Program as part of our effort to reduce earthquake hazard in the United States We are part of the USGS Geologic Division and receive funding from the USGS Earthquake Hazards Program which is funded in turn by the National Earthquake Hazards Reduction Program NEHRP The http geomag usgs gov Geomagnetism Program is also funded under the Earthquake Hazards Program Earthquakes pose significant risk to 75 million Americans in 39 States The USGS is the only Federal agency with responsibility for recording and reporting earthquake activity nationwide Citizens emergency responders and engineers rely on the USGS for accurate and timely information on where an earthquake occurred how much the ground shook in different locations and what the likelihood is of future significant ground shaking U S map showing earthquake office locations goldenloc html National Earthquake Information Center location maps National

Pacific Northwest Earthquake Information link Pacific Northwest Earthquake Information link The USGS estimates that several million earthquakes occur in the world each year but many go undetected because they occur in remote areas or have very small magnitudes The USGS now locates about 50 earthquakes each day 20 000 a year The USGS is working to improve its earthquake monitoring and reporting capabilities through the Advanced National Seismic System In the past three years the USGS has installed approximately 300 new earthquake monitoring instruments in the San Francisco Seattle Salt Lake City Anchorage Reno Las Vegas and Memphis areas Full implementation of ANSS will result in 6000 new instruments on the ground and in structures Once in place the ANSS will provide emergency response personnel with real time within 5 10 minutes of an event information on the intensity and distribution of ground shaking that can be used to guide emergency response efforts Similarly information on building shaking will equip engineers with the data they need to improve building designs in the future USGS Earthquake Research Seismic field work Research projects have either a regional or topical focus There are currently 15 projects in the Earthquake Hazards Program and they are reviewed annually External Research Program The U S Geological Survey USGS invites research proposals that will assist in achieving the goals of the http www nsf gov National Earthquake Hazards Reduction Program NERHP The goal of NEHRP is to mitigate earthquake losses that can occur in many parts of the nation by providing earth science data and assessments essential for land use planning engineering design and emergency preparedness decisions The USGS participates in the NEHRP with the http www nsf gov National Science Foundation NSF the National Institute of Standards and Technology NIST and the http www fema gov Federal Emergency Management Agency FEMA the latter having the lead role to plan and coordinate the national effort In addition to activities performed by USGS staff expertise in earthquake studies that exist outside the federal government is applied through a substantial program of grants cooperative agreements and or contracts with universities state regional and local government agencies and private industry External research is solicited in order to develop information knowledge and methods which are relevant to the major program elements spacer http www doi gov U S Department of the Interior http www usgs gov U S Geological Survey This page is brought to you by the
