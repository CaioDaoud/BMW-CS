framework that is committed to the values of access quality and efficiency for the state s higher education system As Missouri continues to increase aspiration and performance levels for all students it will require an educational system that is responsive to the needs of students for easy mobility across institutions Missouri s commitment to have institutions with distinctive missions including differential admission standards underscores the importance of an effective transfer and articulation system These credit transfer guidelines are intended to ensure that high school graduates with clear educational objectives may complete a degree program offered by colleges and universities in the shortest possible time whether the student remains in one institution or transfers to another The Coordinating Board for Higher Education CBHE recognizes that each Missouri college and university is responsible for establishing and maintaining standards of expectations for all students completing its courses programs certificates or degrees It also recognizes that for effective and efficient transfer of credits between and among these colleges and universities it is necessary to exercise this responsibility within the context of a statewide system of higher education Effective transfer and articulation is based upon inter and intra institutional communication a mutual respect for institutional integrity a high degree of flexibility procedures for identifying problems a mechanism for implementing appropriate solutions regular and systematic review of policies and a timely and orderly process for change Harmonious and equitable consideration of any problem which a student may encounter in moving from one institution to another is an ultimate objective of these transfer guidelines toc Back to Top Button A STATUTORY RESPONSIBILITY Section 173 005 6 RSMo requires the Coordinating Board for Higher Education to establish guidelines to promote and facilitate the transfer of students between institutions of higher education within the state This responsibility is discharged through the implementation of the board s credit transfer policy toc Back to Top Button B APPLICABILITY OF GUIDELINES These transfer guidelines are applicable to course credits and related matters for undergraduate students who wish to transfer between Missouri public colleges and universities that have regional accreditation or which have been advanced to candidacy status by the North Central Association The Coordinating Board also recommends these guidelines to Missouri independent institutions that meet the same accreditation standards In addition the development of program to program articulation agreements is encouraged between Missouri s public and or independent institutions of higher education and postsecondary institutions such as proprietary institutions with national accreditation recognized by the U S Department of Education and certification by the Coordinating Board for Higher Education toc Back to Top Button C GUIDING PRINCIPLES Neither transfer nor native students should be advantaged or disadvantaged as a consequence of the transfer process The delivery of lower division courses should not be the sole province of a single institution but should be subject to articulation between sending and receiving institutions Separate credit hour limitations should not be imposed on transfer students based on the type of sending institution Variations in baccalaureate degree programs which reflect institutional missions should be respected and accommodated The faculty role in the design of curricula and the establishment of degree requirements must be respected Program to program institutionally articulated degrees for the AS and AAS should be encouraged A workable transfer system requires predictability of transfer decisions and responsiveness to student needs Demonstrating the effectiveness of transfer and articulation systems including institutional and statewide agreements requires analyses that employ common data elements and definitions that are collected and shared among institutions and with the Coordinating Board for Higher Education Prior to full implementation any curricular changes that affect existing transfer and articulation agreements should involve timely mutual consultation by both receiving and sending institutions and notification to all affected parties once new agreements are reached Presidents and chancellors should ensure that effective transfer and articulation are a priority at their institutions and that all members of the academic community including faculty and department chairpersons must honor all transfer agreements agreed to by their institutions In order to facilitate student success and to reinforce the respective missions of associate and baccalaureate institutions students who begin an associate degree program and who aspire to pursue a baccalaureate degree should be encouraged by both the sending and receiving institutions to complete the associate degree program to transfer immediately upon associate degree completion and to complete the baccalaureate degree in a timely manner toc Back to Top Button II STATEWIDE GENERAL EDUCATION POLICY The state has high expectations for all Missouri college graduates and has promulgated a statewide general education policy that establishes a rationale for general education defines the responsibilities of institutions faculties and students for general education and promotes broad curricular goals and student competencies that should result from institutional general education programs toc Back to Top Button A RATIONALE FOR GENERAL EDUCATION General education is the curricular foundation of the American academy It encourages students to acquire and use the intellectual tools knowledge and creative capabilities necessary to study the world as it is as it has been understood and as it might be imagined It also furnishes them with skills which enable them to deepen that understanding and to communicate it to others Through general education the academy equips students for success in their specialized areas of study and for fulfilled lives as educated persons as active citizens and as effective contributors to their own prosperity and to the general welfare As the academy s knowledge of the world is structured so must general education be constructed to introduce students to the traditional disciplines of the arts and sciences As that knowledge is ever changing so must general education alert students to connections between the traditional disciplines and to the potential for interaction among all branches of knowing ordering and imagining the real world As the real world is diverse so must general education inform students that the world is understood in different ways and provide them with the means to come to terms intelligently and humanely with that diversity As diversities of knowing and understanding must be made open and accessible so students must acquire appropriate investigative interpretative and communicative competencies toc Back to Top Button B RESPONSIBILITIES While the academy is not the only place where these high aims can be imagined and achieved more than any other place it receives public and private support for just these ends General education is thus a core responsibility of the academy as well as a foundation curriculum for students To discharge this trust academic institutions must deliver appropriate resources to their faculties and faculties must design and transmit to students effective means and persuasive rationales for achieving general education aims Both institutions and faculties must satisfy their constituents that these ends are being achieved satisfactorily and in ways that are consistent with each institution s mission While students have a right to expect their academic institutions and faculties to fulfill these responsibilities students also incur the obligation to act as partners in learning in order to become agents in not merely receivers of their own general education In the state of Missouri all public institutions of higher education and each independent or proprietary institution that is signatory to the statewide credit transfer policy must agree that the general education achievements of students who succeed in discharging their obligations are wholly transferable in terms both of graduation credit and of real competencies toc Back to Top Button C TRANSFERABILITY OF GENERAL EDUCATION CREDIT In order to facilitate the transfer of students among institutions of higher education in the state the Coordinating Board for Higher Education has supported the development of a statewide general education policy that is intended to ensure the portability of general education credit among Missouri s colleges and universities Each institution of higher education in Missouri fosters a program of general education General education programs vary from institution to institution as each represents a statement reflective of the institution s ethos and mission General education programs are developed by the faculty and validated by the institution s administration and governing board Each institution expresses through its general education program the high expectations for the academic skills and knowledge that all students who complete degrees offered by that institution should master Consistent with its mission each public institution of higher education in Missouri and each independent or proprietary signatory to this policy shall offer a general education program that is designed to enable students to achieve the following general education goals In order to ensure transferability of general education credit among these institutions each shall specify and publish a 42 semester hour block of general education credit that will be considered equivalent to corresponding blocks of credit at other public and signatory institutions in enabling students to achieve these general education goals toc Back to Top Button D GENERAL EDUCATION GOALS AND COMPETENCIES Two terms describe the aims of general education in the state of Missouri goals and competencies The term goals refers to the curricular intent of state policy regarding the academic skills and knowledge content of general education The term competencies denotes illustrative state level expectations for student performance in general education Faculty at each institution design a general education program that fits the ethos and mission of each institution and meets state level curricular goals Each general education program must also specify institution level student competencies that will follow from achieving these curricular goals and which are in alignment with the suggested competencies listed in the following sections These general education aims and outcomes may be achieved in various ways including through traditional courses through interdisciplinary teaching or through competencies embedded across the curriculum State level curricular goals and institution level student competencies for general education fall into two categories academic skills and knowledge toc Back to Top Button 1 Skills Areas a Communicating State

informed judgments and to solve problems by applying evaluative standards Suggested Competencies Students will demonstrate the ability to recognize the problematic elements of presentations of information and argument and to formulate diagnostic questions for resolving issues and solving problems use linguistic mathematical or other symbolic approaches to describe problems identify alternative solutions and make reasoned choices among those solutions analyze and synthesize information from a variety of sources and apply the results to resolving complex situations and problems defend conclusions using relevant evidence and reasoned argument reflect on and evaluate their critical thinking processes toc Back to Top Button c Managing Information State Level Goal To develop students abilities to locate organize store retrieve evaluate synthesize and annotate information from print electronic and other sources in preparation for solving problems and making informed decisions Suggested Competencies Students will demonstrate the ability to access and or generate information from a variety of sources including the most contemporary technological information services evaluate information for its currency usefulness truthfulness and accuracy organize store and retrieve information efficiently reorganize information for an intended purpose such as research projects present information clearly and concisely using traditional and contemporary technologies toc Back to Top Button d Valuing State Level Goal To develop students abilities to understand the moral and ethical values of a diverse society and to understand that many courses of action are guided by value judgments about the way things ought to be Students should be able to make informed decisions through identifying personal values and the values of others and through understanding how such values develop They should be able to analyze the ethical implications of choices made on the

standards to observance of works in the humanities and fine arts toc Back to Top Button c Mathematics State Level Goal To develop students understanding of fundamental mathematical concepts and their applications Students should develop a level of quantitative literacy that would enable them to make decisions and solve problems and which could serve as a basis for continued learning The mathematics requirement for general education should have the same prerequisite s and level of rigor as college algebra Suggested Competencies Students will demonstrate the ability to describe

STRUCTURE OF GENERAL EDUCATION CURRICULA The statewide general education policy requires institutions to design and offer a general education program that includes a minimum of 42 semester hours of credit distributed across the academic skills and knowledge areas of the previous sections These credit hours should be distributed in such a way that students who complete the 42 semester hour block of general education credit from any institution of higher education in the state will have had the opportunity to achieve the high expectations embodied in the state level goals and suggested competencies set forth in the previous section All Missouri public institutions of higher education and each independent or proprietary signatory institution have the privilege and responsibility to exercise their academic and institutional autonomy to design and promulgate a general education program that supports their respective institutional mission and assists students to meet these high expectations Institutional programs may be designed in various ways to achieve these state level goals and institution level competencies and the role of institutional faculty in designing institutional general education curricula and establishing general education requirements for their degrees will be respected Each institution will document how the design of its 42 semester hour block of general education credit meets the state level curricular goals and ensures that its students achieve institution level competencies that are aligned with these goals Each institution will also document how it implements this design how it assesses and certifies student skills and knowledge and how it uses assessment results to improve its general education program Institutions may design and promulgate general education programs that exceed the expectations of the 42 semester hour block of credit In this case institutions may require transfer students to complete general education and other institutional requirements in addition to the 42 semester hour block of credit only when these additional requirements are also required of native students Students assume full responsibility for meeting specified degree and or major requirements specifically those related to course prerequisites Each public and signatory institution will define a 42 semester hour general education block of credit that achieves state level curricular goals All of these 42 semester hour blocks of general education credit will be considered equivalent for transfer purposes Typically these blocks will be composed primarily of lower division courses and requirements However institutions may define their 42 semester hour blocks of general education credit as being composed of both lower and upper division courses and requirements In such cases receiving institutions must accept as equivalent other institutions blocks of general education credit even when these are composed solely of lower division courses Baccalaureate professional schools or programs may specify exceptions to the credit hour minimum established in this section by promulgating these exceptions and by establishing specialized articulation programs related to associate of science AS and associate of applied science AAS degrees as detailed in the following sections Transfer students completing AS and AAS degrees from institutions that do not have program to program institutionally articulated agreements are not exempt from satisfying the requirements of departments or divisions of the institution into which the student transfers toc Back to Top Button F GENERAL EDUCATION PROGRAM REVIEW AND NOTIFICATION PROCESS The purpose of the review and notification process for general education programs is to ensure that all public institutions and each independent or proprietary signatory institution have general education programs in place that meet the statewide policy This review process is intended to be collegial professional and helpful to institutions in developing general education programs that meet policy guidelines The program review and notification process is intended to focus on strengthening general education to be reflective of the state s commitment to institutional autonomy and to be protective of each student s right to the fair application of this statewide credit transfer policy Initial Review and Approval All Missouri public institutions of higher education and each independent or proprietary institution that is signatory to the statewide credit transfer policy will develop and post both on the CBHE web site and their own institution s web site a curricular design and an assessment plan indicating how that institution plans to implement and assess general education The institution s program will remain on the CBHE web site for a period to be determined by the Coordinating Board for Higher Education s Committee on Transfer and Articulation COTA All public and signatory institutions will be invited to comment on each institution s plan through the designated transfer and articulation officer The institution whose program has been posted for comments will be responsible for forwarding comments to the CBHE for posting evaluating the feedback responding to the commenting institution and determining which suggestions it will incorporate into its curriculum design When an institution is ready to implement its program the president will notify COTA Once COTA acknowledges receipt of the notice that institution is then eligible to certify its students for transfer under the statewide general education policy standards The institution has the further responsibility to post its general education program on its web site and to maintain its currency and accuracy COTA will notify all public and signatory institutions when an institution is eligible to certify students for transfer Any concerns that individual institutions have about another s general education program will be handled via the Appeals Process that is part of this credit transfer policy See pages 19 20 Ongoing Dialogue and State Level Policy Review The annual statewide transfer and articulation conference will be used as a vehicle to encourage communication and collaboration about institutional approaches to general education Sessions will be scheduled to discuss concerns about the state credit transfer policy and to promote good practices in general education teaching transfer and assessment toc Back to Top Button III TRANSFER A TRANSFER DEGREES Transfer degrees are prescribed lower division programs that are designed to facilitate the transfer of students into a four year baccalaureate degree program upon completion of a lower division program at another institution of higher education Associate degrees especially the associate of arts degree are the most common lower division transfer degrees Determination of course requirements of the major for a baccalaureate degree including introductory and related courses is the prerogative of the baccalaureate degree granting institution The catalog of each four year institution will state clearly the requirements for each baccalaureate degree program When specific prerequisites are required they will be designated and noted in conjunction with the course description Transfer students who have completed prerequisites will not be required to duplicate study in the area The catalog will specify any restrictions or additional requirements for each major A baccalaureate degree program or major consists of a general education program and a coherent grouping of courses or subject area requirements in a specific discipline or program field Generally the number of credit hours required for a major ranges from thirty 30 to forty eight 48 semester credit hours There may be exceptions to this rule in the case of highly specialized professions or disciplines interdisciplinary studies or majors in general liberal arts studies toc Back to Top Button 1 Statewide Transfer Associate of Arts Degree The associate of arts AA degree is designed as the statewide general studies transfer degree This degree is structured for entry into the general range of baccalaureate degree programs offered by four year colleges or universities Students completing the AA degree will have completed a general education program that is consistent with the statewide general education policy consisting of a minimum of 42 semester hours of credit Courses taken as part of an AA degree outside the general education program should be carefully chosen to ensure applicability to the baccalaureate graduation requirements for the program of study which the student intends to pursue at a four year college or university Consequently the transfer student has the responsibility to become familiar with the specific major and graduation requirements of the four year institution to which transfer is intended Institutions are also encouraged to develop articulation agreements to ensure the transfer of credit outside of the 42 semester hour general education block of credit A student s associate of arts degree curriculum may include introductory courses and other courses which permit the student to explore areas of specialization that can be pursued at a later time at the upper division level For AA students who continue in a particular field the courses should be adequate in content to be counted fully toward the baccalaureate degree toc Back to Top Button 2 Program to Program Institutionally Articulated Degrees This policy encourages both two year and four year institutions to develop voluntary supplemental articulation agreements for the AS and AAS degrees in addition to the AA state transfer degree These agreements will facilitate transfer and consider all factors surrounding a student s achieved program competencies successes and professional career aspirations toc Back to Top Button a Associate of Science Degree An associate of science AS degree is a specialized transfer degree which is intended for students interested in transferring into professional programs that have a greater emphasis on science and math This is an articulated degree program that results from careful planning and agreement between institutions These programs will be developed by consultation between sending and receiving institutions on a program by program basis This process may involve changes in general education requirements Students completing articulated AS degrees will be accepted as having completed lower division general education and prerequisite courses equivalent to the lower division general education requirements completed by native students in the same degree program over a similar time period toc Back to Top Button b Associate of Applied Science Degree An associate of applied science AAS degree is oriented toward career and professional preparation The primary purpose of this associate degree is to prepare a student for entry into a particular occupation While the AAS degree has not historically been intended as a transfer degree into a baccalaureate program Missouri s initiatives to develop and expand its workforce development and training system demand that education and training career paths extend beyond the associate degree When used for transfer this degree requires careful planning and agreement between institutions on a program by program basis This process may involve changes in general education requirements In order for students to be adequately prepared for the workforce and to facilitate articulation agreements a minimum of twenty five percent of the AAS degree requirements shall consist of college level transferable general education The AAS transfer student should be able to pursue upper division advanced coursework in appropriate baccalaureate degree programs These may include the same degree area or related degree areas Institutions are encouraged to explore opportunities for multiple articulation agreements toc Back to Top Button c Other Associate Degrees All other associate degrees not addressed by either the statewide transfer AA degree or program to program institutionally articulated AS or AAS degrees will be evaluated on a course by course basis until such time that an articulated agreement exists toc Back to Top Button B TRANSFER WITHOUT A DEGREE 1 General Education Curricula Students at both two and four year institutions of higher education should be encouraged to pursue and complete coherent programs of study including associate and baccalaureate degree programs and coherent general education programs The statewide general education policy is designed to assist students to transfer a block of 42 semester hours of general education credit by ensuring that all institutions of higher education in the state have comparable expectations regarding what students know and can do as a result of completing these blocks of general education credit and by ensuring that all public and signatory institutions define and publish 42 semester hour blocks of general education credit that will be considered equivalent for the purposes of transfer All Missouri public institutions of higher education and independent or proprietary institutions that are signatory to this statewide credit transfer policy shall recognize the validity of other institutions general education programs Once an institution of higher education in Missouri has defined and published its 42 semester hour block of general education credit and has notified COTA that its general education program meets the statewide general education policy s requirements the integrity of its general education program and block of credit will be recognized by the other institutions of higher education in Missouri Students who are certified by their sending institutions as having completed a 42 semester hour block of general education credit will not be required to complete any additional general education requirements that are part of the corresponding general education block of the institutions to which the students transfer Students assume full responsibility for meeting the specified degree and or major requirements specifically those related to prerequisites General education and other institutional requirements in addition to the 42 semester hour block of credit may be required of transfer students by receiving institutions only when native students are obligated to satisfy the same requirements toc Back to Top Button 2 Transfer Prior to Degree or General Education Program Completion Students enrolled in associate degree programs should be encouraged to complete their degrees Students pursuing associate of arts degrees should be encouraged to complete a 42 semester hour general education block of credit that meets statewide general education policy prior to transfer Students who transfer before completing either an associate of arts degree or a 42 semester hour general education block of credit will have their transcripts evaluated by receiving institutions Both receiving and sending institutions are encouraged to maintain articulation agreements to assist students and institutions in evaluating student academic accomplishments consistently and accurately toc Back to Top Button 3 Role of Sending Institutions Sending institutions have the responsibility to certify and document on student transcripts that students have completed associate degree programs Similarly sending institutions have the responsibility to certify and document on student transcripts that students have completed a 42 semester hour general education block of credit that is consistent with statewide general education policy and is considered equivalent for the purposes of transfer with other institutions 42 semester hour general education blocks Further sending institutions should encourage students to complete coherent programs of study They should collaborate with receiving institutions to develop articulation agreements and share information with each other and with students that assist students in transferring from one institution to the other without loss of credit toc Back to Top Button 4 Role of Receiving Institutions Receiving institutions have the responsibility to attempt to match students academic accomplishments with the requirements of the degrees to which the students aspire Specifically receiving institutions are obligated to accept completion of a 42 semester hour general education block of credit at any public institution or any independent or proprietary signatory institution as equivalent to and as completing the receiving institution s 42 semester hour general education block of credit Receiving institutions may only impose additional general education or other institutional requirements when these are also required of native students Further receiving institutions should encourage students to complete coherent programs of study They should collaborate with sending institutions to develop articulation agreements and share information with each other and with students that assists students in transferring from one institution to the other without loss of credit toc Back to Top Button C TRANSFER OF LOWER DIVISION CREDIT HOURS BEYOND THE ASSOCIATE DEGREE REQUIREMENTS The number of hours required for baccalaureate level graduation of transfer students that meet the guidelines in this document should be equivalent to the number of hours required of native students assuming all lower division prerequisites for courses in the student s baccalaureate program have been met Transfer students must meet the minimum residency upper division course and graduation requirements established by the baccalaureate institution Students with AA degrees will typically transfer sixty four 64 credit hours which is approximately the first two years of the baccalaureate educational experience Lower division credit hours completed beyond the AA degree will be evaluated for transfer on a course by course basis Within the constraints of these minimal requirements and assuming program to program articulation for these additional hours AA AS and AAS transfer students may choose to complete additional lower division requirements at two year institutions to meet the lower division prerequisites and or lower division graduation requirements established by the baccalaureate institution toc Back to Top Button D OTHER TRANSFER RELATED MATTERS 1 Junior Level Status While students completing associate degree programs have traditionally been accepted at the junior level by receiving institutions it is important to note that baccalaureate programs vary in the number of hours required for graduation In addition all students are subject to prerequisite course requirements residency and upper division credit hour requirements a minimum grade point average both cumulative and in the major and in some instances upper division general education requirements At some baccalaureate institutions this collection of requirements varies by college and or major Consequently while junior level has meaning in the context of having completed the first two years of higher education it may be misleading to assume that completion of a baccalaureate degree can be accomplished in four years Transfer students who have completed the associate of arts degree from a signatory institution that is in compliance with this policy shall be received as having completed the statewide 42 semester hour general education block of credit toc Back to Top Button 2 Curriculum Changes All parties agree to be consultative when proposing curriculum changes which are likely to impact existing transfer and articulation agreements The integrity of articulated degree programs requires agreements about process and procedure on implementing changes to existing agreements Changes affecting either the statewide AA transfer degree or a program to program institutionally articulated AS or AAS degree should be made after appropriate consultation and with enough lead time to provide an orderly and timely change in the nature of these articulated agreements In instances of concern by any institution involved in this statewide credit transfer policy or in program to program institutionally articulated degrees the affected institution may initiate an appeal as provided in the Appeals Process section of this policy toc Back to Top Button 3 Admission of Transfer Students a Institutional Admission The core of any orderly transfer process is the mutual acceptance of the nature and purpose of the statewide transfer associate of arts degree and the program by program institutionally articulated AS and AAS degrees If any institution of higher education finds it necessary to be selective in its admission of qualified transfer students its criteria for admission of transfer students must be consistent with its mission and shall be stated in its official publications Such publications shall be on file with the Coordinating Board for Higher Education Students transferring with the AA statewide transfer degree or the AS or AAS program by program institutionally articulated degree must meet the published admission requirements of the receiving institution for transfer study by students with these degrees Transfer of the AA degree shall be predicated upon the following minimum statewide expectations 1 Completion of a minimum of 60 semester hours of college level work oriented toward a baccalaureate degree 2 Completion of an institutionally approved general education program as defined in Section A of this document 3 Achievement of a cumulative grade point average of not less than 2 0 A 4 0 B 3 0 C 2 0 D 1 0 F 0 0 provided that only the final grade received in courses repeated by the student shall be used in computing this average Students who earn an associate of arts degree meeting these minimum statewide criteria as validated by a regionally accredited associate degree granting institution are eligible for admission to a baccalaureate degree granting institution subject to the provisions outlined in this section but not necessarily to a particular baccalaureate degree program major Prospective transfer students should consult the catalogs of receiving institutions to determine specialized programmatic admission requirements if any for particular degree programs The enrollment status of transfer students with the AS or AAS program by program institutionally articulated degree shall be defined as part of each transfer agreement toc Back to Top Button b Program Admission Transfer students will be admitted to programs based on the same criteria as those established for the native students of the receiving institution Admission to a specific baccalaureate degree program may result in a different computation of the grade point average GPA The number of hours and junior level standing will be evaluated in accordance with the Transfer of Lower Division Credit Hours Beyond the Associate Degree Requirements section on page 14 of this document toc Back to Top Button 4 Catalog Transfer students shall be subject to the same regulations regarding applicability of catalog requirements as native students This implies that transfer students may choose the operative catalog of the receiving institution at point of initial enrollment at the sending institution assuming they meet all the conditions required of native students e g continuous enrollment Conditions that restrict a student s options e g noncontinuous enrollment changes of major or admission to program should be invoked only if they are also applied to native students toc Back to Top Button 5 Change in Major When students initiate changes in their stated major or degree objectives those students assume full responsibility for meeting the specified new degree and or major requirements In particular students who have earned an AS or AAS program by program institutionally articulated degree and who change majors or who change the institution they plan to attend should anticipate potentially significant changes in baccalaureate degree program completion requirements All students regardless of the associate degree in which they are enrolled who plan to transfer into a different field of study have the responsibility to seek pre transfer counsel from the sending or receiving institution regarding required courses in the program which they plan to pursue and the evaluation of credits already earned as the credits apply to the particular baccalaureate program to be pursued toc Back to Top Button 6 Transfer of Grades The academic record at a given institution will include all courses attempted Grades of D or better earned in college level work at institutions of higher education to which the transfer articulation agreement applies shall be transferred as full credit to another college or university however the receiving institution will treat all grades on courses attempted on the same basis as that of the native student For example if a native student is required to repeat a D grade in a specified course a transfer student will also be required to repeat the D grade in the same course toc Back to Top Button 7 Credit by Examination Dual Credit Experiential Learning and Pass Fail Credit Pass fail credit will be transferred and treated by the receiving institution in the same way pass fail credit is treated for native students Advanced placement credit by examination dual credit and credit for experiential learning will be transcripted and clearly defined Course equivalency for credit by examination may be listed as desired The receiving institution shall transfer and treat credit earned through advanced placement credit by examination dual credit and credit for experiential learning in the same manner as it would for native students except that
