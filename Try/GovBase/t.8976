CHRNS index html CHRNS sitemap html SiteMap Monetary Assistance University of Maryland Outreach Program There is a wide range of neutron scattering techniques that are uniquely suited to solve many problems of current scientific and technological interest One of the goals of the index html NCNR is to provide scientists from across the nation with the opportunity to utilize the neutron instrumentation and capabilities at NIST to solve these problems However this can represent a significant barrier for scientists who are not already well versed in neutron scattering in that they don t have the experience knowledge or familiarity to successfully use the facilities To encourage new users and provide them with this essential educational opportunity the University of Maryland has developed an outreach program to assist first time users to come to the neutron facility and carry out an experiment in close cooperation with NIST scientific staff To qualify for this program a user Must have a neutron proposal that has been approved by the Program Advisory Committee or a formal request that has been approved by one of the instrument scientists i e you must have beam time Must be from a US University Preference will be given to graduate students postdoctoral researchers and junior faculty in that order A travel stipend of up to 400 will be paid to the new user to help offset travel and subsistence expenses The stipend will be processed as a travel reimbursement through the University of Maryland and a U S social security number is required to submit the paperwork Original receipts will be required for all expenses except food food expenses are based on a per diem which is currently 39 day Eligible expenses requiring a receipt include hotel airfare car rental mileage for personal car and parking Assistance will be provided to an individual one time only There is a maximum of two new scientists per experiment that will be funded Implementation To apply for this program send an email message to Professor Robert Briber at mailto neutron outreach eng umd edu the University of Maryland neutron outreach eng umd edu An application form will be sent to you electronically This will be evaluated and you will be notified of the decision NEW PROGRAM TO SUPPORT GRADUATE STUDENTS VISITS TO THE NCNR As part of its expanding education and outreach effort the NCNR is pleased to offer university based research groups planning to come to the NCNR for a PAC approved experiment the opportunity to request travel support for an additional graduate student to participate in the experiment This support is intended to enable prospective thesis students for example to acquire some first hand experience with a technique they may use later in their own research At the same time university professors would have the opportunity to evaluate the potential of a prospective thesis student in an actual research situation The guidelines for eligibility in this new program are A request must be associated with a PAC approved experiment proposal Currently the NCNR s PAC reviews proposals for the following instruments 30 m SANS NG 3 and NG 7 USANS BT 5 Cold Neutron Triple Axis Spectrometer SPINS NG 5 Disk Chopper Spectrometer DCS NG 4 Fermi Chopper Spectrometer NG 6 Backscattering Spectrometer NG 2 Spin Echo Spectrometer NG 5 Neutron Reflectometers NG 7 and NG 1 Only graduate students who are not members of the measurement team listed in the original proposal are eligible Travel support must be requested for a particular student at least one month in advance of the dates of the experiment Students whose applications for travel support are approved must make their travel arrangements in accordance with NIST s travel policies The main requirements are the cost of transportation to and from the NCNR will be paid by NIST if and only if the arrangements are made in advance through NIST s travel office all local expenses will be reimbursed usually within 30 days pending the completion of a signed travel voucher including all necessary receipts Professors are encouraged to nominate students from underrepresented groups for this educational opportunity Support for this program comes from the National Science Foundation through the NIST NSF Center for High Resolution Neutron Scattering CHRNS Requests for travel support should be made directly to Dr Charles Glinka Director CHRNS NIST Center for Neutron Research 100 Bureau Drive STOP 8562 Gaithersburg MD 20899 8562 Tel 301 975 6242 Fax 301 921 9847 Email mailto cglinka nist gov
