Task Leader res Profiles reid html David Reid The Great Lakes basin is the aquatic gateway to the heartland of America and a hot spot for aquatic invasive species AIS introductions that can reach other sections of the U S The earliest recorded aquatic species invasion in the Great Lakes was the sea lamprey first entering the Great Lakes from the Atlantic Ocean via the Erie Canal during the 1820s Based on scientific documentation there are at least 162 AIS in the Great Lakes as of 2001 and twelve of these appear to have entered since 1990 Introduced species are now a significant component of most trophic levels in the Great Lakes GLERL s research on invasive species targets two key issues Prevention of new invasive species introductions Understanding the biology and
