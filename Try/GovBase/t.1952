Tumwater to hear arguments related to a number of issues that recently surfaced in Premera Blue Cross application to convert to for profit status The hearing was requested by third party interveners in the case who maintain that Premera should not be permitted to modify its application under the current schedule The interveners contend that Premera should be required to file a new application which would trigger a new schedule in the case Kreidler who has final authority to grant or deny the application under the state s Holding Company Act has established a schedule that calls for a Jan 15 adjudicative hearing on the application with a final decision by March 15 In a related development Premera has filed a separate motion asking for a 60 day extension of the existing schedule and deadlines The hearing is scheduled for 2 p m Dec 10 at the Tumwater City Hall Chambers Conference Room 555 Israel Rd SW Tumwater Meanwhile Kreidler has begun a second round of special premera
