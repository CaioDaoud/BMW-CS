Birmingham 1999 November 2000 allwdc agenda html All WDC World Data Center System Scientific data gathering has a long history but mechanisms for data distribution and exchange are more recent The first large scale international scientific enterprises were the International Polar Years of 1882 1883 which eventually led to the International Geophysical Year of 1957 1958 Planning of the IGY was coordinated by CSAGI the Special Committee for the IGY set up by the http www icsu org International Council for Science CSAGI established the World Data Center system to serve the IGY and developed data management plans for each IGY scientific discipline Because of its success the WDC system was made permanent and used for post IGY data Over the years the tally of WDCs has changed A comprehensive set of WDCs was established in China in 1988 The WDC in the U S A has expanded and WDC in Russia is now operated by three different organizations Some of the WDC centers in Europe and Asia have moved or have closed but new centers have opened In 1999 the method of naming WDCs was modified to remove the A B C and D references World Data Centers are now referenced by the type of center without reference to the country operating the center i e WDC for Glaciology If there is more than one WDC for a discipline the name of the city where the WDC resides is appended i e WDC for Glaciology Boulder All centers now have computer facilities and most use electronic networks to meet requests exchange catalog information and transfer data Today the WDC system is healthy and viable Most centers are maintaining their funding though not without struggle Data acquisition storage and distribution are expensive WDCs cost money but they are cost effective in transferring data to users and their operational costs represent a tiny fraction of worldwide scientific activity The ICSU Panel on World Data Centres hopes that this Guide will provide a useful overview of the system Read the
