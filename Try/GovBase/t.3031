Overview overview Overview op context CTAS Operational Context processes CTAS Software Processes descriptions Process Descriptions Overview This area of the CTAS website is intended to familiarize the reader with the CTAS software as implemented at NASA Ames Research Center this version is known as the Concept Development Software Following this Overview is a description of how CTAS fits into the ATC infrastructure Then the individual executable processes that make up CTAS are described CTAS is comprised of multiple executable processes that communicate with each via messages sent using a TCP IP socket protocol The processes typically run on distributed workstations connected by a high speed network Running each CTAS tool implies invoking the processes required for that tool each with the appropriate run time options Most processes are required for any of the tools while some are required for only one or two of them Similarly much of the adaptation data which is used to tailor the software to a particular site is common to all of the tools while each tool has some adaptation unique to it The majority of the CTAS software is implemented in the ANSI C language and runs under the Unix operating system About 20 of the software is implemented in C The primary platform for CTAS is the http www sun com Sun Microsystems Sparcstation running Sun s Solaris 2 x operating system which is compliant with the AT T System V Release 4 SVR4 version of Unix The graphical elements of CTAS are implemented using the X11R5 release of X Windows all of the CTAS GUI s use the Motif toolkit except for one which was implemented using the Open Windows toolkit top Go To Top CTAS Operational Context The figure below shows how CTAS as a system fits into the existing air traffic control infrastructure of the U S Each element is described in more detail below CTAS Operational Context Diagram op context txt D CTAS relies on the description of the airspace provided in the FAA s Host computer adaptation data known as Aces and other national adaptation sources These data specify waypoints airways airspace boundaries airport and runway locations expected aircraft types and other parameters unique to a region typically an ARTCC These data are updated every 56 days The data are formatted into files are intended especially for CTAS and are read in by CTAS at start up CTAS requires up to date weather information in order to generate accurate aircraft trajectories Currently this data is provided by the National Meteorological Council NMC in the form of a 3 dimensional grid of wind temperature and pressure data based on a 1 2 or 3 hour forecast generated by NOAA s Rapid Update Cycle RUC processing CTAS requires real time flight plan and track data for all aircraft of interest For the Center tools TMA and EDA Direct To the aircraft data source is the Center Host computer For FAST both the TRACON ARTS computer and the Center Host computer data are used During laboratory simulation with controllers and pilots in the loop the Ames developed Pseudo Aircraft Simulation tool provides the flight plan and track data During full operational use TMA provides advisories to individual sector controllers via a two way interface to the Host computer The advisories consist of ETA s STA s and delay values for each aircraft These data are shown in an alpha numeric ordered linear list on the controller s Planview Display PVD During two way operations the controller may make inputs via the PVD that are sent to and processed by CTAS These inputs include for example a command to swap the order of two aircraft in the linear list Similarly during full operational use FAST sends advisories to the TRACON controllers displays via a two way interface These advisories consist of runway assignment and landing sequence for each aircraft and are displayed in the aircraft s flight data block on the controller s Fully Digital ARTS Display FDAD During two way operations controller inputs are sent to and processed by CTAS for example a command to override the CTAS suggested runway assignment top Go To Top CTAS Software Processes The individual processes that comprise CTAS each play one of three roles communication algorithm or graphical user interface GUI The communications processes manage the data into and out of CTAS and route messages among the processes The algorithmic processes perform the prediction and automation functions The GUI processes provide the interface for users and developers of the CTAS tools As stated previously the CTAS tools TMA FAST EDA Direct To etc have most of their software in common Each tool relies on running a certain combination of processes in certain modes to get the desired behavior The processes required for each tool are described below starting with a list of each CTAS process short and full name The links go to the more detailed process descriptions which follow the figure describing how the processes are configured The figure does not stand on its own but is meant to make the process descriptions more clear Communications Processes tools skip to Running the CTAS Tools cm CM

below shows all of the CTAS processes and their interconnections CTAS Process and Their Interconnections interconnections txt D As indicated in the figure the algorithmic processes are run in accordance with which tool is desired DP the Center scheduler is run only for the TMA and EDA tools The PFS TS pair is only run for the FAST tool and the PFS C TS pair is run for the Direct To and EDA tools The RA TS pair is used for all the tools and multiple RA TS pairs may be run to speed up processing Beyond the selection of which processes to run there are also considerations of the mode of each process When running TMA the use of TRACON data via ADAR is optional if it is desired the ADAR is run in a one way mode delivering TRACON track data to TMA When running FAST the TRACON ADAR connection is required and it is a two way connection In this case the HDAR connection is one way delivering Center track data to FAST ADAR is not generally used for Direct To or EDA but there is nothing to prevent it from being used Further for each tool PGUI and TGUI are run in special tool specific modes that enable some features while disabling others For example the Direct To EDA mode PGUI has many features not available in the TMA or FAST modes Multiple PGUI s and TGUI s may be run on a single CTAS system top Go To Top Process Descriptions This section provides a summary of the functionalities of each CTAS process CM Communications Manager The CM as its name implies manages the communications among all of the CTAS processes shown connected to it in the figures above The exceptions are ISM which acts as a server to CM and TS which communicates via shared memory with its calling process The other processes namely RA PFS PFS C DP PGUI and TGUI are clients to CM and depend on it for their communications CM does not have a direct connection to WDPD Instead CM periodically checks the rendezvous file that WDPD writes to see if a new weather file name has been posted there If so it begins the weather update process with the CTAS processes that need knowledge of the weather CM receives all of the aircraft tracks and flight plans sent by ISM and distributes those data in a controlled manner to all the other processes CM uses the aircraft data to create and maintain its own aircraft database its clients depend on CM to know when an aircraft has been added to or deleted from CTAS CM is the intermediary for any message passed from one client process to another and all messages pass through CM on their way to their intended destination Often a message sent by one process is intended for several processes and CM manages the transmission of each message to all intended recipients In fact CM manages the connection and initialization of all the client processes If those processes are started and cannot establish communication with CM they are programmed to exit Once connected CM completes their initialization including sending all current aircraft and airspace configuration information of interest in the form of messages It is able to do this because since it receives all transmitted messages it is able to extract information from the messages in order to maintain key parameters in its aircraft database as well as airspace variables Then if a new process is started for example a PGUI CM is able to send it the latest information on each aircraft along with any other global parameters that the PGUI needs in order to become current with the rest of the system Similarly since CM receives all messages it is able to record all data necessary for analysis and or playback CM has a GUI that provides several categories of information to the user as well as enabling key user inputs The status information includes a panel showing all the aircraft in the system their aircraft and flight plan types their track status tracked coasting planned etc and their ETA status For each aircraft the user can bring up additional information such as the complete flight plan current track data and current ETA s The CM GUI permits the user to do the following dynamically connect to and disconnect from all valid flight plan and track data sources start and stop data recording or playback initiate two way communications with the Host initiate use of live weather configure the ground speed and vertical speed filters specify which TGUI is in control of the DP and create fake aircraft for testing purposes Another panel allows the user to filter which aircraft are sent to which processes by flight plan type e g arrival departure overflight etc In addition the CM GUI scrolling text window is used by the software to display important messages to the user ADAR ARTS Data Acquisition and Routing The ADAR process provides two way communication between CTAS and the TRACON ARTS computer systems as required for FAST Specifically it is the process that operates between ISM and the TRACON s ARTS Data Gatherer ADG which in turn communicates with the TRACON ARTS computer and FDAD displays The ADAR provides aircraft track and flight plan data from the ARTS It also transmits to ISM controller FDAD inputs of interest to FAST such as runway assignment and missed approach commands From ISM ADAR accepts the FAST runway assignment and sequence number for each aircraft and sends it on to the ADG for processing by the ARTS and display on the FDAD The ADAR software is written and maintained by CSC HDAR Host Data Acquisition and Routing The HDAR process provides CTAS with critical aircraft data from the ARTCC Host computer In addition during operational use HDAR sends CTAS generated data back to the Host for display on the Center controllers PVD s All data passed between HDAR and the rest of CTAS are in the form of messages The messages received from the Host by HDAR and passed to the rest of CTAS include Flight Plans describing the aircraft type route of flight cruise altitude cruise speed and take off time for each aircraft The route as it is converted into individual waypoints by the Host known as the AK route Radar tracking data giving the position altitude and speed of all aircraft at 12 second intervals Amendments to flight plans as they are entered by controllers into the Host Deletion of flight plans Controller commands to CTAS such as manual swap aircraft resequence and suspend unsuspend messages The HDAR also sends data back to the Host whenever CTAS TMA is being used in its operational two way mode The messages sent from CTAS to the Host during two way operations include Aircraft STA s to the outer fix and meter fix and current delay values Various control and health checking messages The HDAR is actually composed of several executable processes The radar daemon is the primary process for the functionality described above In addition for research and evaluation purposes Host data is provided on dedicated serial lines to NASA Ames and other facilities The radar io server process reads the serial line and converts the data into socket based messages For research purposes a single radar daemon can allow many CTAS systems to connect to it ISM Input Source Manager The ISM manages communication and data processing for the many sources of flight plan and track data that CTAS may receive and passes any two way messages back to the relevant data sources via the appropriate daemon The purpose of ISM is to transform disparate data from multiple sources into source independent messages then send them to the CM for distribution to the other CTAS processes In this way CM and all the other processes need not concern themselves with the source of the data This applies in particular to flight plan and track data In addition HDAR and ADAR each send and receive unique message types to from CTAS and for those messages ISM simply passes the data through to CM Another major purpose of ISM is to provide flexible merging of data sources The data merging is critical for FAST in which ARTCC Host and TRACON ARTS track and flight plan data are both required ISM merges the data and handles the case of data from both sources being received for the same aircraft ISM contains the logic required to identify uniquely an aircraft or flight for which data is being received from multiple sources Finally ISM performs track data filtering In the case of the ground speed ISM can either smooth the ground speed signal that comes from the source or can generate its own signal based on position measurements ISM also generates the aircraft course heading and vertical speed signals that the downstream processes require ISM provides the ability to filter data sources individually and or after two sources are merged Currently ISM is able to merge data from one ARTCC and one TRACON source It is also able to process data from PAS as if it were a Center source and to merge PAS data with a single TRACON source Some infrastructure has been developed to prepare for merging of multiple ARTCC s however the precise requirements for this capability have not yet been established WDAD Weather Data Acquisition Daemon The WDAD process is a perl script that is responsible for gathering weather predictions from the Rapid Update Cycle RUC model produced at the National Centers for Environmental Prediction NCEP or other hosts and making them available on the CTAS network file system The primary RUC data set used is the one hour forecast which is generated approximately every hour The data file from NCEP covers the entire continental US and some offshore areas When a new file arrives and is successfully transferred to the designated file system WDAD writes the new file name to a rendezvous file WDPD polls the rendezvous file on a periodic basis and when it is updated WDPD begins its processing tasks on the data file named in the rendezvous file DP Dynamic Planner The DP performs the major automation function of TMA namely the scheduling of aircraft arriving to an airport To perform its function the DP requires flight plan and track data from the Host ETA s to all eligible runways from the RA s and scheduling constraints as input by the controller The DP makes intensive use of site adaptation files that provide the scheduling and runway allocation rules for a particular airport A complete description of the DP functionality is provided in the tma html TMA section of this web site The DP was designed using the Object Modeling Technique an object oriented design method developed by Rumbaugh The DP is implemented in the C language PFS Profile Selector The PFS performs the major automation function for FAST namely generating the runway assignment and sequence to that runway for each aircraft arriving at an airport The runway allocation and sequencing are designed to maximize the efficiency of traffic flow without increasing controller workload To perform its function the PFS requires flight plan and track data from both the Center Host and the TRACON ARTS sources It also requires the results of the RA analysis of all possible routes for an aircraft which it uses to bound its search for the optimum solution Like PFS C and RA the PFS utilizes the TS and its trajectory generation function communicating with it via the shared memory interface The PFS makes extensive use of site adaptation in the form of runway allocation rules and rules that specify how aircraft routes and speeds may be varied from their nominal values A complete description of the PFS functionality is provided in the fast html FAST section of this website PFS C Profile Selector Center The PFS C performs functions required by the EDA and Direct To tools For Direct To it performs probing of all aircraft to identify those that can save significant amounts of flight time by going off of standard routes to follow shorter more direct routes It also identifies conflicts among aircraft on both the standard and direct routes computing how likely the conflicts are to occur where and when The Direct To and conflict data are sent to PGUI for display For EDA PFS C generates descent advisories for arrival aircraft to meet the schedules generated by the DP In other words given a desired time to arrive at the meter fix PFS C computes the aircraft s required cruise speed where and when it should begin to descend and its descent speed The resulting ETA to the meter fix is a close as possible to the input STA When being used for Direct To only PFS C does not rely on having scheduled times as inputs while they are required when running EDA It is possible to use PFS C for both Direct To and EDA simultaneously since the direct to search and conflict probing functions are separate from the advisory generation function Like RA and PFS PFS C uses TS extensively via the shared memory interface Inputs site adaptation data especially analysis category information flight plan and track data RA analysis results in the form of an analysis packet STA s from DP if descent advisories are desired controller inputs from the PGUI Processing EDA and Direct To in use For arrival aircraft only determines fast slow ETA range based on RA analysis sets desired meter fix arrival time equal to DP generated STA accepts any controller constraints entered via the PGUI applies allowable degrees of freedom to iterate on trajectory until ETA meets STA within a tolerance if DOF is within TS TS iterates on various trajectory segments to meet time if DOF is within PFS C PFS invokes TS with different iteration values until ETA meets STA extracts advisory information from solution trajectories including cruise Mach cas descent Mach cas top of descent location meter fix crossing altitude and speed first turn location and heading For ALL aircraft probes all non arrival aircraft for possible direct to routing probes all aircraft trajectories for conflicts as defined by PGUI input criteria computes time and locationof initial loss of separation and minimum separation and probability of conflict for all aircraft pairs that were predicted to be in conflict can compute predicted minimum separation distance of one or more aircraft to a selected reference point Spacing Tool Outputs sends advisory ETA s and descent advisories for arrival aircraft to PGUI sends direct to list to PGUI sends conflict list to PGUI records various data files for analysis RA Route Analyzer Like TS RA is a fundamental algorithmic element for all of the CTAS tools RA determines and generates all possible routes for an aircraft from its current position to its end point in accordance with the site adaptable analysis category decision tree The analysis category is re computed for every radar track update Typical inputs into the determination of the category include aircraft category arrival departure overflight aircraft location engine type destination airport and current runway being analyzed Within each analysis category is defined a set of routes to fly each having different degrees of freedom DOF s The DOF s can include such items as speed slowdown points and turn locations For each of these routes RA determines the ETA and other desired parameters at points of interest along the route The ETA information is passed to the DP as the basis for scheduling and to the GUI processes for display A larger set of data incorporating information about the degrees of freedom used to generate each ETA is sent to PFS and PFS C This analysis packet sets up the ETA limits within which the solution must fall for each aircraft Inputs site adaption data especially the analysis category decision tree which defines how to determine which category an aircraft falls in to and for each category all route and speed degrees of freedom that may be exercised to reach the destination flight plan and track data current airport configuration specifying the runways in use controller constraints entered from the GUI s Processing once per flight plan per aircraft parses the route of flight into a linked list of route segments for each eligible runway or just once for non arrivals determines the analysis category of an aircraft based on flight plan track and controller inputs using the analysis category decision tree for each nominal route defined in the analysis category for each degree of freedom modifies the nominal route speeds and end point conditions versus the nominal sends aircraft state info route waypoints and end point conditions to TS receives and processes end point ETA set and 4D trajectory from TS extracts intermediate ETA distance and ground speed information from 4D trajectory Outputs sends ETA s to every eligible runway to DP and TGUI ETA message includes fast nominal and slow ETA s to outer fix meter fix final approach fix and runway threshold and ground speeds at the meter fix and FAF sends analysis packets to PFS and PFS C sends a derived ETA message to CM for display to support FAST TS Trajectory Synthesizer TS is often referred to as the computational engine of CTAS because it provides the accurate 4 dimensional trajectories and associated ETA s that all of the CTAS tools depend on The 4D trajectories are defined by aircraft x y altitude and future time The time of the last point in the trajectory is the ETA of the aircraft for that set of input parameters Inputs aircraft model data for all aircraft types to be processed including aircraft aerodynamics propulsion characteristics and preferred speeds site adaptation data especially waypoint information weather data from WDPD via CM and calling process RA PFS PFS C from the calling process the aircraft initial condition waypoints to be flown through desired end conditions altitude airspeed and location and intermediate altitude and speed constraints Processing constructs a smooth horizontal path from the input waypoints including turns constructs a vertical profile using forward or backward integration along a series of discrete segments result is the estimated time to fly for Center arrival trajectories computes fast and slow times to fly based on setting the cruise and descent speeds to the limits of the aircraft capability for Center arrival trajectories if requested generates a trajectory that meets a desired arrival time Outputs nominal fast slow and meet time ETA s nominal 4D trajectory The TS has a standalone capability in which single trajectory requests can be input and their results stored in text files This is very useful for development and debugging of the TS software and the aircraft models The TS has recently been redesigned in C using the Object Modeling Technique WDPD Weather Data Processing Daemon The WDPD is responsible for converting raw weather files provided by the WDAD into binary weather files usable by CTAS Currently WDPD processes 80km 40km and 20km forecast files which are provided in the form of a Lambert conformal grid that covers the continental US The grid data includes wind component speeds temperature and pressure as a function of latitude longitude WDPD extracts a site adaptable section of the grid appropriate for the Center of interest and converts the coordinate system of the data into the local Center x y coordinate system The resulting grid points are equally spaced along each of the 3 dimensions to allow for maximum computational efficiency in interpolating between grid points Once the binary file has been successfully processed WDPD writes the new filename to a rendezvous file CM polls the file periodically looking for a new file Once a new file is found CM then forwards the filename in a message to all processes having interest in the weather data and manages the weather update process An associated library provides functions and macros for clients to access the weather data efficiently and to get the desired data easily PGUI Planview Graphical User Interface The PGUI fills several distinct roles within CTAS for several diverse customer groups It is used by Traffic Management Coordinators TMC s in the Traffic Management Unit during TMA and FAST operations to provide a planview of the traffic situation and also to display the CTAS advisories that are being sent to the controllers on the floor is used by CTAS developers to display a wide variety of debugging information is used by CTAS research teams to emulate an individual controller s station for the purposes of simulating what would be seen on the operational floor is used by CTAS research teams to prototype the computer human interface for future systems intended for use on the operational floor The PGUI performs all of these functions in both a Center and a TRACON environment Start up command line options and default files are used to configure the PGUI for the CTAS tool user and environment in which it will be used To support this diversity of uses with as much flexibility as possible the software is both complex and very general For example the user may configure the aircraft full data blocks FDB s which are the tags associated with each aircraft track symbol to have up to five lines of information each line having two fields each field being able to time share a number of items and some items having color override capability These items may all be adjusted during operation of the system Therefore the software to drive the FDB s is very general and makes no assumptions about what might be displayed in any situation The primary inputs to the PGUI are aircraft flight plan and track data ETA s and STA s runway assignments and sequence numbers if PFS is running descent advisories and or conflict prediction and direct to information if PFS C is running responses to user requests such as flight plan RA or PFS routes to be displayed for a particular aircraft developer requested debugging information The PGUI also receives and processes weather information but only for the purpose of displaying it to the user The PGUI design philosophy is that it not do any algorithmic processing of data Therefore its outputs are limited to messages that result from user requests that must be forwarded to other processes These outputs include requests for flight plan route display flight plan amendments emulation of controller inputs such as manual runway assignment and aircraft altitude or speed clearance entries TGUI Timeline Graphical User Interface The TGUI is the TMC s primary interface to the TMA tool The functionality of the TGUI is described fully in the TMA GUI portion of this website In summary TGUI provides the mechanism by which the TMC configures the TMA scheduler and provides situational awareness to the TMC in the form of timeline load graph and textual data In addition the TGUI provides utilities for delay reporting saving TMC s the chore of doing it manually The TGUI is used to support development and in particular provides a debugging interface to the DP The TGUI is also used during FAST operations and displays the FAST STA s generated by the PFS It accepts a set of TMC inputs relevant for FAST operations namely airport landing configuration and runway separation requirements Most of the other scheduling constraints are not meaningful for FAST and so are inhibited when running in the FAST mode Aside from user inputs the primary CTAS messages utilized by TGUI are the ETA and STA messages and messages that support delay reporting such as meter fix crossing events top Go To Top This page was last updated on 11 05 03 Webmaster mailto Gregory L Wong nasa gov
