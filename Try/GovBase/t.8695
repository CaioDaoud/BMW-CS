California Law Revision Commission State Seal California Law Revision Commission Last revised Friday January 10 2003 10 12 AM Unfair Competition This recommendation proposes revisions in the unfair competition law Business and Professions Code Section 17200 et seq to limit the potential for abuse and to help ensure that the interests of the general public are adequately represented The proposal focuses on the need to provide a degree of finality in representative actions to avoid repetitive claims on behalf of the general public and improve the settlement process The proposal also imposes certain formalities that should inhibit the use of claims on behalf of the general public to increase leverage in disputes between business entities Under the proposed revisions A plaintiff seeking to represent the general public would have to be an adequate representative of the interest of the general public pled and meet basic conflict of interest standards The plaintiff s attorney would have to be an adequate legal representative of the interests of the general public pled in the action Notice of commencement of a private representative action and notice of proposed terms of a judgment would be given to the Attorney General and district attorney Notice of the proposed terms of the judgment would also be given to parties in other similar cases against the defendant A fairness hearing would be held to make sure that the judgment in a private representative action is fair reasonable and adequate to protect the interests of the general public Interested persons would be permitted to appear and comment on the proposed terms The determination of a private representative claim on behalf of the general public would bar any further private representative claims on that cause of action Any right to sue for individual claims would not be affected by this rule Prosecutors would be given a degree of procedural priority over private plaintiffs in representing the public The right of the private plaintiff to attorney s fees is recognized in cases where a private plaintiff contributes to a prosecutor s action If you have questions or comments on this study send email to Nathaniel
