24 APPENDIX B APPENDIX B DIRECTORY OF OMC REGIONAL OFFICES 28 APPENDIX C APPENDIX C SOURCES OF PUBLICATIONS 29 OVERVIEW The last few years has witnessed significant changes to the regulations for the transportation of hazardous materials These changes were first introduced under Docket HM 181 Docket HM 181 provided for a phased transition of the hazardous materials regulations which would to the maximum extent possible be compatible with international standards in order to facilitate foreign trade and maintain the competitiveness of U S goods The applicability of the hazardous materials regulations was extended to all intrastate shipments of hazardous materials by highway effective October 1 1998 as published in the final rule Docket HM 200 dated January 8 1997 This final rule also provided exceptions for materials of trade agricultural operations and certain non specification packaging used in commerce The Secretary of the Department of Transportation receives the authority to regulate the transportation of hazardous materials from the Hazardous Materials Act HMTA as amended and codified in 49 U S C 5101 et seq The Secretary is authorized to issue regulations to implement the requirements of 49 U S C The Research and Special Programs Administration RSPA was delegated the responsibility to write the hazardous materials regulations which are contained in 49 CFR Parts 100 180 In order to accomplish his responsibilities under the HMTA the Secretary may authorize any officer employee or agent to enter upon inspect and examine at reasonable times and in a reasonable manner the records and properties of persons to the extent such records and properties relate to 1 The manufacture fabrication marking maintenance reconditioning repair testing or distribution of packages or containers for use by any person in the transportation of hazardous materials in commerce or 2 the transportation or shipment by any person of hazardous materials in commerce In regards to commercial or governmental activities Special Agents of the Department of Transportation can not be denied reasonable access to those areas that fall within the official scope of their duties The Secretary has delegated this authority to the Federal Aviation Administration FAA Federal Highway Administration FHWA Federal Railway Administration FRA Research and Special Programs Administration RSPA and the United States Coast Guard USCG The hazardous materials regulations are constantly changing These changes may be the result of changes to the international regulations Congressional mandates and or advances in technology The challenge facing shippers and transporters is to keep current The Government Printing Office has made the Federal Registers and 49 CFR available on the Internet The website for the Federal Registers is redirect cfm page http www access gpo gov su docs aces aces140html http www access gpo gov su docs aces aces140html The website address for 49 CFR is

Transportation of Hazardous Materials in commerce by and their offering to 1 Interstate Intrastate and Foreign carriers by rail car aircraft motor vehicle and vessel 2 The representation that a Hazardous Material is present in a package container rail car aircraft motor vehicle or vessel 3 The manufacture fabrication marking maintenance reconditioning repairing or testing of a package or container which is represented marked certified or sold for use in the transportation of Hazardous Materials 49 CFR 171 1 a GENERAL DOT HAZARDOUS MATERIALS REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS No person may offer or accept a hazardous material for transportation in commerce unless that person is registered in conformance with subpart G of Part 107 of this chapter if applicable and the hazardous material is properly classed described packaged marked labeled and in condition for shipment as required or authorized 49 CFR 171 2 a Underlined in the preceding extract from the Hazardous Materials Regulations are three important terms person offeror and commerce See Appendix A Definitions The word shipper is frequently used by industry in place of the word offeror For the purpose of this booklet only the term shipper and offeror are used interchangeably These three words are important in that they define when you are subject to the jurisdiction of the Department of Transportation Additionally you may be subject to the requirements of other Federal and or State Laws FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND GOVERNMENT CONTRACTORS Most Federal Agencies including the Department of Defense are considered offerors when they ship hazardous materials by commercial carriers In those rare instances where governmental agencies transport hazardous materials in commerce on government vehicles aircraft the agency is also considered a carrier Contractors were made fully subject to all the requirements of the Federal hazardous materials transportation law The Uniformed Services of the United States generally are not subject to the commerce clause of the Constitution Therefore military shipments transported on military vehicles or aircraft are not subject to Federal jurisdiction However many states require military movements by highway to conform to 49 CFR or compatible state regulations DOD and Service Regulations also require compliance with 49 CFR Parts 100 180 When in peacetime the military services procure commercial transportation offering into commerce the military is engaged in commerce and required to comply with 49 CFR HM REGISTRATION Persons who offer for transportation or transport in foreign interstate or intrastate commerce a any highway route controlled quantity of a Class 7 radioactive material b more than 25 kg 55 lbs of a Division 1 1 1 2 or 1 3 explosive material in a motor vehicle rail car or freight container c more than 1 L per package of a material extremely poisonous by inhalation d a hazardous material in a bulk packaging having a capacity of 3 500 gals for liquids or gases or more than 468 cubic feet for solids or e a shipment in other than bulk packaging of 5 000 lbs gross weight or more of one class of hazardous material for which the transport vehicle requires placarding loaded at one location The following are excepted from the registration requirement 1 An agency of the Federal Government 2 A State Agency 3 An agency or political subdivision of a State 4 An employee of 1 3 5 A hazmat employee including an owner operator of a motor vehicle leased to a registered motor carrier for 30 days or more 6 A person domiciled outside the United States who offers HM solely from outside the United States See 49 CFR 107 606 a 6 for exceptions and reciprocity Registration is required annually and includes a fee For additional information on the registration requirement you may call 1 800 467 4922 or 202 366 4109 The Modal Agencies have established their own programs to prioritize their inspection activities of transporters of hazardous materials Research and Special Program Administration in addition to the Modal Agencies have selection criteria for shippers offerors that are similar i e 1 Investigation of known shipper violations discovered during carrier audits 2 Non frivolous written complaints alleging violations of the Federal Hazardous Materials Regulations 3 NRC and DOT 5800 1 spill and hazmat incident reports 4 Referrals from other governmental agencies and special investigations targeting high risk hazardous materials such as explosives and certain radioactive materials In almost all instances these shipper inspections are unannounced In the event that inspection of your hazardous materials operations disclose violations of the hazardous materials regulations you may be subject to civil and or criminal penalties PENALTIES PER VIOLATION CIVIL MINIMUM 250 00 MAXIMUM 27 500 00 CRIMINAL INDIVIDUAL 250 000 00 CORPORATION 500 000 00 Levels of fine from 18 U S C and includes provision for imprisonment for not more than 5 years Although the Federal Government is exempt from the penalty provisions See definition of person on page 26 of this H O employees of the federal government are not exempt under the HMTA HAZARDOUS MATERIALS SHIPPER RESPONSIBILITIES DETERMINE WHETHER A MATERIAL MEETS THE DEFINITION OF A HAZARDOUS MATERIAL PROPER SHIPPING NAME CLASS DIVISION IDENTIFICATION NUMBER HAZARD WARNING LABEL PACKAGING MARKING EMPLOYEE TRAINING SHIPPING PAPERS EMERGENCY RESPONSE INFORMATION 24 HOUR EMERGENCY RESPONSE TELEPHONE NUMBER CERTIFICATION COMPATIBILITY BLOCKING AND BRACING PLACARDING Listed above are the major responsibilities of HM shippers General shipper responsibilities are contained in 49 CFR Part 173 Identification of a hazardous material is the first step and frequently the most difficult Of all the shipper s offerors responsibilities the requirement to properly classify a hazardous material is very important It is from the proper identification of the hazardous materials that the other requirements are based on The next step is what do I call it The requirement to provide emergency response information is frequently a concern of shippers Who must sign the certification statement on the Bill of Lading May a Carrier remove or alter my blocking and bracing How do I determine what name to use to identify hazardous material being offered for transportation We are currently in the process of transitioning to the new international requirements In order to provide sufficient time to comply with these changing requirements RSPA has provided transition dates contained in 49 CFR 171 14 October 1 1993 was a very important date On that date all the hazard communication requirements except placarding become effective for all HM except Infectious Substances Although the regulation of Marine Pollutants was not a part of the HM 181 Docket the final rule issued on November 5 1992 tied compliance to the transition dates in 49 CFR 171 14 Materials designated as Marine Pollutants are listed in a new Appendix B to Table 172 101 The rule applies to bulk shipments by all modes and non bulk shipments by vessel The current 49 CFR is consistent with the international requirements However there are some differences in the requirements for shipment by international air international vessel and shipments to and from Canada The HMR addresses the requirements for the movement of shipments prepared in accordance with the international and Canadian regulations in 49 CFR sections 171 11 171 12 and 171 12 a respectively HAZARDOUS MATERIALS CARRIER RESPONSIBILITY SHIPPING PAPER PLACARD AND MARK VEHICLE LOADING AND UNLOADING COMPATIBILITY BLOCKING AND BRACING INCIDENT REPORTING EMPLOYEE TRAINING Above lists contain some of the major responsibilities of HM carriers Carrier and offeror shipper responsibilities frequently overlap When a motor carrier performs a shipper function the carrier is responsible for performing that function in accordance with 49 CFR The cargo space of the vehicle should be suitable for the material being shipped The vehicle itself must be in sound mechanical condition The carrier must check to insure that the material offered by the shipper is properly described and packaged In addition to the provisions of 49 CFR Parts 100 180 interstate motor carriers of placarded loads must comply with the hazardous materials requirements in 49 CFR Part 397 INCIDENT REPORTING Immediate notification of a hazardous materials incident by a carrier is required at the earliest practical moment for incidents that occurs during the course of transportation including loading unloading and temporary storage in which as a direct result of the hazardous materials any one or more of the following occurs 1 a person is killed 2 a person receives injuries requiring his or her hospitalization 3 estimated carrier or other property damage exceeds 50 000 00 4 an evacuation of the general public occurs lasting one or more hours 5 One or more major transportation arteries or facilities are closed or shut down for one hour or more 6 fire breakage spillage or suspected radioactive contamination occurs involving shipment of radioactive materials 7 release of a marine pollutant in a quantity exceeding 450 L for liquids or 400Kg for solids 8 any situation of a serious nature that the carrier feels is not covered by 1 7 Each notice shall be given telephonically to the Department at 800 424 8802 Incidents involving etiologic agents may be made to the CDC at 800 232 0124 For content of report and additional information please see 171 15 A written report shall be submitted on DOT Form F 5800 1 for all incidents involving the transportation of hazardous materials unless excepted Detailed reporting requirements are contained in 171 16 HAZARDOUS MATERIALS TABLE 49 CFR 172 101 Table of Hazardous Materials and Special Provisions The purpose of the table is to assign proper shipping names class and division and guidance for packaging and handling requirements for hazardous materials It is important to remember to read the instructions contained in front of table 172 101 when using this section Many violations occur because individuals fail to review these instructions Information that is available from the Table consists of symbols which determine applicability proper shipping name and shipping description hazard class or division identification number packing group label s required special provisions packaging authorizations quantity limitations aboard aircraft and vessel stowage requirements HAZARDOUS MATERIALS The definition of HAZARDOUS MATERIALS include those materials designated by the Secretary of the Department of Transportation as posing an unreasonable threat to the public and the environment The terms Hazardous Materials includes all of the following 1 Hazardous Substances 2 Hazardous Wastes 3 Marine Pollutants 4 Elevated Temperature Material 5 Materials identified in 172 101 and 6 Materials meeting the definitions contained in Part 173 HM REGULATED BY U S D O T UN HAZARD CLASS 171 2 CLASS 1 EXPLOSIVES DIVISION 1 1 MASS EXPLOSIVE HAZARD DIVISION 1 2 PROJECTION HAZARD DIVISION 1 3 MASS FIRE HAZARD DIVISION 1 4 MINOR EXPLOSION HAZARD DIVISION 1 5 VERY INSENSITIVE EXPLOSIVES DIVISION 1 6 EXTREMELY INSENSITIVE EXPLOSIVES Explosives were formerly classified as Class A B C or Blasting Agent A comparison of the old and new classification system is contained in 173 53 In addition to the change in classification systems we are now concerned with compatibility groups which are designated by alpha characters 1 1A 1 2D etc Information on the different compatibility groups are contained in 49 CFR 173 52 CLASS 2 GASES DIVISION 2 1 FLAMMABLE GASES DIVISION 2 2 NON FLAMMABLE GASES DIVISION 2 3 POISONOUS OR TOXIC This class includes materials that are Compressed Dissolved under Pressure or Pressurized Cryogenic Liquids and Liquefied Gases CLASS 3 FLAMMABLE LIQUID Includes materials whose Flash Point FP is not more than 141E F NOTE See Combustible Liquids below CLASS 4 FLAMMABLE SOLIDS DIVISION 4 1 FLAMMABLE SOLID DIVISION 4 2 SPONTANEOUSLY COMBUSTIBLE MATERIAL DIVISION 4 3 DANGEROUS WHEN WET CLASS 5 OXIDIZING SUBSTANCES ORGANIC PEROXIDES DIVISION 5 1 OXIDIZER DIVISION 5 2 ORGANIC PEROXIDE CLASS 6 POISONOUS TOXIC AND INFECTIOUS SUBSTANCES DIVISION 6 1 POISONOUS TOXIC MATERIAL DIVISION 6 2 INFECTIOUS SUBSTANCE CLASS 7 RADIOACTIVE MATERIAL CLASS 8 CORROSIVES CLASS 9 MISCELLANEOUS DANGEROUS GOODS Category includes Environmentally Hazardous Substances Elevated Temperature Material Hazardous Wastes and Marine Pollutants COMBUSTIBLE LIQUIDS Materials whose FP is greater than 141EF but less than 200EF are still regulated domestically as combustible liquids Materials transported domestically only whose FPs are 100EF up to 141EF may be reclassified as combustible in accordance with 173 120 b A COMBUSTIBLE LIQUID which does not sustain combustion is not subject to the requirements of the HMRs See Appendix H Part 173 for the required tests ORM D ORM D material means a material such as a consumer commodity which although is subject to the regulations presents a limited hazard during transportation due to its form quantity and packaging Each ORM D material and category of ORM D material is listed in the 49 CFR 172 101 Table and 173 144 CONSUMER COMMODITIES Consumer commodities means a material that is packaged and distributed in a form intended for or suitable for sale through retail sales In order to determine if a particular hazardous materials may qualify as a consumer commodity refer to the section number in Part 173 identified in column 8 of the 172 101 Table for that material EXCEPTIONS Agricultural Operations The transportation of agricultural products see 49 CFR171 8 by highway may be excepted from some or all of the provisions of the Hazardous Materials Regulations when transported in accordance with the provisions of 49 CFR 173 5 Materials of Trade The transportation of materials of trade see 49 CFR 171 8 by highway may be excepted from many of the requirements of the Hazardous Materials Regulations when transported in accordance with the procedures contained in 49 CFR 173 6 HAZARDOUS MATERIALS COMMUNICATIONS Part 172 of 49 CFR contains the hazardous materials communication requirements in addition to the hazardous materials table emergency response requirements and training The term hazardous materials communications commonly refers to shipping papers marking labeling and placarding Shipping Papers Shipping paper requirements are contained in 49 CFR Part 172 Subpart C For the purpose of the hazardous materials regulations a shipping paper is any shipping document whose purpose is to communicate a hazard and conforms to the requirements contained in this Subpart Each person who offers hazardous materials for transportation shall describe the hazardous materials on a shipping paper that conforms to the requirements of the HMR No carrier may transport a hazardous material unless it is accompanied by a shipping paper that is prepared in accordance with the HMR The description of hazardous materials on a shipping paper is contained in section 172 202 The basic description now includes proper shipping name hazard class identification number and packaging group The class names IMO class and division numbers or subsidiary hazard classes may be entered in parentheses Entries are required for type packaging and weight net or gross It is important to remember that except for materials in the U N Recommendations the ICAO Technical Instructions or the IMDG Code a material that is not a hazardous material according to this sub chapter may not be offered for transportation or transported when its description on a shipping paper includes a hazard class or an identification number specified in 49 CFR 172 101 This provision is most frequently violated when the shipments involve non RCRA Waste which are not considered DOT hazardous materials Depending on the material being transported additional information requirements to be entered on the shipping paper are contained in 49 CFR 172 203 Recent changes include entries for Technical names for n o s and other generic descriptions Organic peroxides to include concentration All poisonous materials subject to 172 203 m where the poisonous constituent is not mentioned in the proper shipping name for materials meeting the definition of poison inhalation hazard see 171 8 Poison Inhalation Hazard as provided in 172 203 m and the words Hazard Zone A Hazard Zone B Hazard Zone C or Hazard Zone D as appropriate Also see 173 133 b The regulation requires an emergency response telephone number to be placed on the shipping paper The telephone number must be monitored at all times when the material is in transportation to include storage incidental to transportation The number must be of a person who is knowledgeable of the hazardous materials being shipped and the appropriate emergency response procedures or a person who has immediate access to a person who has such knowledge If you use the number for a service provider such as CHEMTREC you must have a valid contract in force with the service provider This telephone number must be readily identifiable on the shipping paper A problem with some Bills of Lading are the numerous emergency numbers for various types of problems such as requests for delivery times or request for safe havens Emergency responders may have trouble identifying the DOT emergency response telephone number The DOT does not dictate who signs the certification on the shipping papers The individual who signs the certification should be the individual most knowledgeable of the shipment Public Law 103 311 amended 49 U S C 5110 to require retention of hazardous materials shipping papers for 1 year Marking The requirements for marking of packages is contained in 49 CFR Subpart D Part 172 The basic marking requirement consists of the proper shipping name and identification number of the hazardous materials contained in the package Markings should be durable in English and not obscured by other markings or labels Depending on the material there may be additional marking requirements For non bulk packaging technical names must be marked in parenthesis in association with the proper shipping name if required by 172 203 k Identification numbers are not required for ORM D and limited quantities Bulk packaging requirements are in section 172 302 Identification Numbers must be on each side and each end for packages 3785 L 1 000 gals or more and for cylinders permanently mounted on tube trailer motor vehicle Identification Numbers on two opposing sides for packages less than 3785 L 1 000 gals Technical names not required for bulk packages You may not offer or transport a container unless the HM markings apply to the material contained in the package There is an exception for empty containers if 1 In a vehicle or freight container the package is not visible and is loaded and unloaded by the shipper or consignee or 2 The markings are securely covered during transport The following is a listing of additional marking requirements Authorized Abbreviation Elevated temperature material Class 7 radioactive materials Portable tanks Liquid Hazardous Materials in Non Bulk Packaging Cargo tanks Poisonous Hazardous Materials Tank cars and multi unit tank car tanks ORM D Bulk packagings other than portable tanks cargo tanks tank cars and multi tank car tanks Identification number markings Explosive Hazardous Material Marine Pollutant Hazardous Substances in non bulk packagings LABELING General labeling requirements are contained in 49 CFR subpart E Part 172 Each person who offers for transportation or transports a hazardous material shall ensure the package is properly labeled There are a number of exceptions to the labeling requirements contained in 172 400a Prohibited labeling is contained in 172 401 The following is a list of additional requirements Additional labeling Label Specifications Class 7 radioactive material There is a separate section for each of the authorized labels that gives an example of the label and describes the label Sections 172 411 through 172 450 contain the required design for each label Labels for mixed and consolidated packagings Authorized label modifications Placement of labels PLACARDING General placarding requirements are contained in 49 CFR Subpart F Part 172 Each person who offers for transportation any hazardous materials subject to the HMR shall comply with the applicable placarding requirements Applicability of placarding requirements 172 500 Placarding is not required for infectious substances ORM D limited quantities small quantity shipments and combustible liquids in non bulk packages Placards may not be displayed on any packaging freight container unit load device motor vehicle or rail car unless the placard represents a hazardous material loaded into or onto the conveyance unless the shipment is in accordance with the TDG Regulation the IMDG Code or the UN Recommendations General placarding requirements are contained in 172 504 Each bulk packaging freight container unit load device transport vehicle or rail car containing any quantity of hazardous materials must be placarded on each side and each end with the placards specified in Tables 1 and 2 172 504 contains a number of notes and exceptions to these requirements When two or more Table 2 materials are contained in the same transport vehicle the Dangerous placard may be used instead of the specific placard required for each hazard class However when 1 000 kg 2 205 lbs or more of a single category of HM is loaded on a transport vehicle the placard specified for that material must be displayed 172 504 c contains an exception from the placarding requirement for shipments that contain less 454 kg 1 001 pounds of Table 2 materials A frequent problem encountered involves the 1 001 lb exception The 1 001 lbs is aggregate gross weight Aggregate gross weight is the total weight of all hazardous materials and its packaging loaded on a single transport vehicle There are additional requirements for placarding such as Placarding for subsidiary hazard Bulk packages Providing and affixing placards by Highway Visibility and display of placards Special placarding provisions by Highway General specifications for placards Providing and affixing placards by Rail There is a section for each placard that gives an example and describes it Special placarding provisions by Rail Freight containers and aircraft unit load devices NOTE FOR SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS FOR PREPARATION OF SHIPMENTS YOU MUST USE THE MOST CURRENT EDITION OF 49 CFR HAZARDOUS MATERIALS TRAINING In addition to the communications requirements that took effect on October 1 1993 hazmat employers must have trained hazmat employees hired prior to 07 02 93 For complete definition of hazmat employer and hazmat employee please see definitions contained in appendix A TRAINING REQUIRED General awareness familiarization General awareness and familiarization training is intended to raise the hazmat employees awareness of the HMR and the purpose and meaning of the hazard communication requirements All hazmat employees must have this training Function specific training Function specific training is intended to teach the necessary knowledge skills and abilities for an individual s job function Safety training This training provides information concerning the hazards posed by materials in the work place personal protection measures The training may include basic emergency response procedures but is not intended to satisfy the requirements of 29 CFR 1910 120 Modal specific requirements Any additional training required by 49 CFR PARTS 174 175 176 or 177 The regulation does not specify sources of training It is not the position of DOT to designate sources of training nor certify training courses instructors and or schools It is the hazmat employers responsibility to determine the adequacy of the training being presented Training may be in any appropriate format including lecture conference self paced instruction interactive video etc INITIAL TRAINING A new hazmat employee who changes job functions may perform those functions prior to completion of training provided the employee performs those functions under the direct supervision of a properly trained and knowledgeable hazmat employee and the training is completed within 90 days after employment or job function RECURRENT TRAINING Employees must receive the required training every three years or any time there is a change in job function A change in the Hazardous Materials Regulations constitute a change in job function RECORDKEEPING REQUIREMENTS A record of current training inclusive of the preceding three years in accordance with this subpart shall be created and retained by each hazmat employer for each hazmat employee for as long as that employee is employed by that employer as a hazmat employee and for 90 days thereafter The record shall include 1 The hazmat employee s name 2 The most recent training completion date of the hazmat employee s training 3 A description copy or the location of the training materials used to meet the requirements 4 The name and address of the person providing training and 5 Certification that the hazmat employee has been trained and tested as required by this subpart The records required by this rule must be produced upon reasonable demand by an authorized employee of the Department of Transportation Records may be in any format such as paper or electronic files as long as they contain the required information and are readily available Compliance with the current requirements for a CDL with a tank vehicle or hazardous materials endorsement provides a driver with the general knowledge and skills necessary to safely operate a commercial motor vehicle with hazardous materials cargo This may satisfy the hazardous materials training requirements As a hazmat employee additional specialized training may be required based on the job function and material specific requirements related to the handling of hazardous materials The hazmat employer must determine the extent to which the CDL endorsement satisfies all training requirements note CDL endorsement s may not fulfill the safety training requirement also not all drivers transporting HM are required to get a CDL It remains the responsibility of the hazmat employer to ensure that their hazmat employees are properly trained for each hazmat function in accordance with the requirements of 49 CFR Subpart H Part 172 The training requirements for hazmat employees who also drive commercial motor vehicles are supplemental to the licensing requirements of the CDL program Accordingly RSPA is not providing a blanket exception from this final rule for a hazmat employee who operates a commercial motor vehicle with a tank vehicle or hazardous materials endorsement on a CDL I would recommend that motor carriers review the training material and test for the hazardous materials or cargo tank endorsement to the CDL and compare these with their company operations For those operations not adequately covered by the CDL endorsement the driver must be trained and tested Recurrent training is required every three years If a CDL Endorsement is valid for four years or the regulations change then the CDL Endorsement does not meet the recurrent training requirement EMERGENCY RESPONSE INFORMATION A 24 HOUR EMERGENCY RESPONSE TELEPHONE NUMBER ON THE SHIPPING PAPER EMERGENCY RESPONSE INFORMATION ON THE SHIPPING PAPER OR IN A SEPARATE DOCUMENT MAINTAINED WITH THE SHIPPING PAPER DESCRIPTION OF THE HM IMMEDIATE HAZARDS TO HEALTH IMMEDIATE METHODS FOR HANDLING SMALL OR LARGE FIRES AND SPILLS OR LEAKS PRELIMINARY FIRST AID MEASURES The requirement for Emergency Response information is contained in 49 CFR Part 172 Subpart G The number must be maintained at all times that a shipment is in transit The use of beepers answering machines and switchboards are not authorized The phone number must be to someone capable of providing information on the material The written emergency response sheet must list the DOT proper description If the carrier s equipment has an emergency response guide or similar document on board there is no requirement to provide a separate emergency response document This exception is valid only if the emergency response guide is on the vehicle An MSDS sheet may be used to fulfill this requirement if it contains all the required information FED STD 313C requires all material procured by the government will be supplied with an MSDS that satisfies this requirement For transportation by highway if a transport vehicle contains hazardous materials for which a shipping paper is required and the transport vehicle is separated from it s motive power and parked at a location other than a facility operated by the consignee consignor or carrier the carrier shall 1 Mark the transport vehicle with the telephone number of the motor carrier on the front exterior near the brake hose or electrical connection or 2 have the shipping paper and emergency response information readily available on the transport vehicle This requirement doesn t apply if the identification number for each hazardous materials contained therein is marked on the outside of the vehicle on an orange panel or white square on point placard PACKAGING WHAT IS PERFORMANCE ORIENTED PACKAGING A packaging construction system based on performance standards developed in the form of Recommendations by the United Nations Committee of Experts on the Transport of Dangerous Goods UN Recommendations The UN standards have general requirements for materials construction and a maximum capacity Strength and integrity of containers are established by a series of performance tests which the package must pass or be capable of passing before it is authorized for the carriage of hazardous materials The international standards have general requirements for materials construction and a maximum capacity as compared to detailed DOT specifications for non bulk packagings formerly contained in 49 CFR Part 178 Packaging requirements are based on the Packing Group of the material its vapor pressure and chemical compatibility between the package and the HM Non bulk packaging standards are based upon a number of performance tests In addition to UN Recommendation performance oriented tests a vibration test for non bulk packaging are required domestically Reuse of plastic and metal drums based on minimum thickness requirements This substitutes for the lack of performance tests in UN standards with regard to puncture resistance abrasion resistance and metal fatigue Package manufacturer s written notification to customers of any specification shortfalls or steps to be taken to conform with applicable specification Performance tests for UN packaging including design qualification tests and periodic retests are included in Part 178 PACKING GROUPS The packing group designated in the 172 101 Table column 5 indicates the degree of danger presented by the material The shipper is responsible for determining the appropriate packing group Packing Group Degree of Danger I Great II Medium III Minor If more than one packing group is indicated for an entry the packing group for the HM is determined using the criteria in 49 CFR Part 173 Subpart D Example For Class 3 flammable liquids materials having more than one packing group indicated in 172 101 Table column 5 the packing group is determined by applying the following criteria Packing Group Flash Point Initial Boiling Point I 35 C II 23 C 73 F 35 C III 23 C 60 C 35 C 49 CFR 173 121 PACKAGING RESPONSIBILITIES General requirements are contained in 49 CFR 171 2 c No person may represent certify mark sell or offer a packaging or container as meeting the requirements of the HMR governing its use in transportation of a hazardous material whether or not it is used or is intended to be used for transportation of a hazardous material unless the packaging or container is manufactured fabricated marked maintained reconditioned repaired or retested as appropriate in accordance with the HMR The Shipper s responsibility is to classify and describe the HM in accordance with Parts 172 and 173 Determine that the packaging or container is an authorized packaging including all special requirements and that the package has been manufactured assembled and marked in accordance with the HMR The shipper may accept the manufacturer s certification specification approval or exemption marking in determining the packaging compliance Based on written instructions by the manufacturer 178 2 c perform all actions which need to be taken for the packaging to conform to the requirements of Part 178 Perform any packaging functions required by 173 24 173 24a and 173 24b for which the shipper is responsible such as filling limits compatibility between the HM and container and securing and cushioning It is the responsibility of the packaging manufacturer and the person who offers a hazardous materials for transportation to the extent that assembly functions including final closure are performed by the latter to assure that each package is capable of passing the prescribed tests Performance Tests The following tests are performed as appropriate for each type of package Drop test 178 603 Leakproofness test 178 604 Hydrostatic pressure test 178 605 Stacking test 178 606 Cooperage test for bung type wooden barrels 178 607 Chemical compatibility test for plastic receptacle 178 608 Vibration standard 173 24a a 5 NOTE Each section must be consulted to determine the applicable test for each type of container PACKAGE TESTING consists of the following Design Qualification Testing 178 601 c 1 Periodic Retesting 178 601 c 2 Production Testing 178 601 c 3 Frequency of Periodic Testing 178 601 e Test Samples 178 601 f The person who manufactures a package subject to the requirements of the hazardous materials regulations is responsible to insure the package is in conformance with the requirements contained in 49 CFR Part 178 When a package is required to be marked with a UN standard or DOT specification the package must meet all the requirements of the regulation including testing The manufacturer or person certifying the package is in compliance with Part 178 must inform in writing each person to whom the packaging is transferred of all requirements of Part 178 not met at time of transfer and all actions that need to be taken for

compatibility you are now required to be familiar with two tables which are Segregation Table for Hazardous Materials is used for all materials However this table is only used for Class 1 materials when comparing Class 1 with other classes divisions of hazardous materials Compatibility Table for Class 1 Explosive Materials is used for determining compatibility for one Class 1 material and another Class 1 material When using the aforementioned tables be sure to read the entire section 178 848 be aware there are special instructions and exceptions listed In addition to this section

App U S C 5123 5124 ANY AGENCY OR INSTRUMENTALITY OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SHIPPER The word shipper is not specifically defined in the HMR 49 CFR Parts 170 179 due primarily to the fact that it is
