R D that will improve the technical societal and environmental benefits of hydropower and provide cost competitive technologies that enable the development of new and incremental hydropower capacity adding diversity to the nation s energy supply Program Organization and Management The Hydropower Program is organized under the DOE Office of Wind and Hydropower Technologies in Washington DC A concerted effort is made to coordinate DOE s research and development with that of other federal agencies and industry including both private and public entities involved with hydropower development An open peer review process involving industry and environmental resource agencies ensures that stakeholders are involved and that high priority research needs are being addressed A Technical Committee is maintained to review progress evaluate results and ensure coordination with related R D activities of other agencies and industry This Technical Committee consists of experts from the hydropower industry and state and Federal agencies In addition the reviews of specialists who are not members of the Technical Committee are obtained when appropriate Active coordination provides situational awareness avoids duplication of research efforts and creates a synergy among related research effects Three of DOE s National Laboratories with experience in hydropower issues provide technical support to the Program Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory INEEL Oak Ridge National Laboratory ORNL and Pacific Northwest National Laboratory PNNL The lead laboratory for engineering and program management support in INEEL ORNL is the lead laboratory for environmental and computational support PNNL is involved in biological testing and technology development studies taking advantage of their experience with fish and test facilities A combination of industry universities and federal facilities conduct research activities for the Hydropower Program Where federal facilities have the equipment and personnel to reduce the overall cost to DOE they are used for conducting R D Updated Tuesday August 26 2003 For general inquiries about the INEEL please call 1 800
