composition of the global atmosphere is altered by human activities and natural phenomena and how such changes in atmospheric composition influence climate ozone ultraviolet radiation pollutant exposure ecosystems and human health Research addresses processes affecting the recovery of the stratospheric ozone layer the properties and distribution of greenhouse gases and aerosols long range transport of pollutants and implications for air quality and integrated assessments of the effects of these changes Atmospheric composition issues involving interactions with climate variability and change such as interactions between the climate system and the stratospheric ozone layer or the effects of global climate change on regional air quality are of particular interest at present The USGCRP budget includes 275 million in FY 2003 for ongoing activities in support of research and observations on the composition and chemistry of the atmosphere Atmospheric composition and chemistry is integrally related to climate variability and change the global water cycle the global carbon cycle and other components of global environmental change The contribution to the USGCRP by these atmospheric studies includes many aspects of atmospheric chemistry and the radiation that is affected by it USGCRP supported research on atmospheric composition focuses on major Earth system interactions including How changes in atmospheric composition alter and respond to the energy balance of the climate system The interactions between the climate system and the ozone layer The effects of regional pollution on the global atmosphere The effects of global climate and chemical change on regional air quality Research also focuses on Earth system linkages with human systems including How the composition of the global atmosphere as it relates to climate ozone ultraviolet radiation and pollutant exposure is altered by human activities and natural phenomena and How changes in composition influence human well being and ecosystem sustainability The atmosphere plays several key roles within the Earth system It transports both energy and atmospheric constituents over many time and space scales There is a continual interplay between the composition the chemistry taking place and radiation within the atmospheric environment Many greenhouse gases that are being added to the atmosphere such as the chloroflurocarbons and carbon dioxide have long residence times there This underscores the need to be able to project the likely effects of such climate forcing agents The potential role of atmospheric aerosols also referred to as particulate matter PM in air quality and climate forcing is significant There is much we do not yet know about natural and human induced aerosols both with regard to their particle properties their distributions in space and time and their impacts upon the climate system Both the magnitude and even the sign of their net climate forcing remain uncertain The National Aerosol Climate Interaction Program NACIP which is being developed out of planning efforts at a recently held workshop has concluded that the aerosol climate problem must be attacked from an observationally constrained basis and has identified five key aerosol phenomena that require special measurement focus in order to significantly reduce the uncertainty in aerosol climate forcing 1 the strength of aerosol emissions from fossil fuel combustion and biomass burning 2 the global distribution of black carbon and organic aerosols 3 the alteration of cloud properties and cloud albedo 4 the reduction in precipitation efficiency and 5 the increase in atmospheric solar heating the reduction in solar radiation at the surface and the impact on surface evaporation images ocp2003 ocpfy2003

well understood Recovery of the ozone layer is expected to occur by about the mid 21st century as the chlorine loading of the stratosphere slowly decreases as a result of the concerted international control effort under the Montreal Protocol However as more is learned about the connection between climate change and ozone depletion there is increasing recognition that rising concentrations of greenhouse gases which trap heat near the Earth s surface and contribute to a cooling of the stratosphere are likely to affect the recovery of the ozone layer In addition the increase in stratospheric water vapor is playing a role both in cooling the lower stratosphere and in depleting ozone through chemical interactions thereby contributing to climate processes Both of these are examples of the complex interconnected global change issues that can be addressed by future research and observations Key research challenges in atmospheric composition include evaluating and projecting the rehabilitation of the stratospheric ozone layer developing a more credible representation of the global distributions and chemical radiative properties of atmospheric aerosols quantifying the atmospheric budgets of a growing suite of chemically active greenhouse gases and their effects on the Earth s energy balance characterizing the effects of global scale changes in atmospheric composition on air quality determining the atmospheric inputs to ecosystems on global to regional scales and establishing a scientifically integrated assessment process that comprehensively addresses multiple atmospheric issues See also http www climatescience gov Library stratplan2003 final ccspstratplan2003 chap3 htm Atmospheric Composition also available http www climatescience gov Library
