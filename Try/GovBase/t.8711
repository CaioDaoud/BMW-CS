Piece Release Date December 04 2003 Holiday Fires Can Be Prevented Saving Lives and Preserving Property By Michael D Brown Under Secretary of Homeland Security for Emergency Preparedness and Response The holiday season is a joyful time of generosity and warmth of songs and family and traditions It is also unfortunately a time when we see an increase in house fires fueled in part by holiday decorations candles and Christmas trees Fires caused by candles for instance increase fourfold during the holidays Some 200 house fires occur each year where Christmas trees are the initial source of ignition House fires during the winter holiday season kill 500 and injure 2 000 people and cause more than 500 million in damage From your home to the White House families will soon begin decorating for the holidays You don t have to give up your holiday decorations in the interest of safety but there are some easy commonsense things you can do to reduce your risk of a fire President Bush actively promotes fire safety and prevention and proclaimed a week in October Fire Prevention Week to emphasize the importance of being prepared to protect ourselves our families and our communities The Department of Homeland Security the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the U S Fire Administration offer these safe holiday tips Select a fresh Christmas tree that is kept in water at all times Needles on fresh trees should be green and should not fall off easily Don t put your tree up too early or leave it up longer than two weeks Dried out Christmas trees can ignite easily and boost a fire by spreading it rapidly to nearby combustible materials Place your Christmas tree in a safe place away from heat sources such as a fireplace or heat vent Maintain your holiday lights Inspect your lights before you use them to ensure they don t have frayed wires gaps in the insulation broken or cracked sockets or excessive wear Only use lighting that is listed by an approved testing laboratory and don t leave the lights on when you re not home Avoid overloading electrical outlets Don t link more than three light strands unless the directions indicate it is safe Periodically check the wires They should not be warm to the touch Use only nonflammable decorations that are placed away from heat vents and if you re using an artificial tree make sure that it s flame retardant Avoid using candles If you do use candles ensure they are in stable holders and place them where they cannot be easily knocked down Do not leave lit candles unattended never put candles on a Christmas tree and never leave the house with candles burning Place menorahs away from vents or flammable materials It s also important to know that fires caused by children increase during the holiday season According to our National Fire Incident Reporting System children cause nearly 60 house fires a day in mid December with another sharp increase on New Year s Day Parents should take precautions to prevent such avoidable tragedies Every year the anticipated joy of the holiday season turns to unexpected grief and loss for families hit by residential fires Please heed our advice and take these steps to a safe and happy holiday season Last Updated December 04 2003 09 37 PM index shtm Home sitemap shtm Site Map access shtm Accessibility Help public factsheets espanol espanol shtm En Espa ol
