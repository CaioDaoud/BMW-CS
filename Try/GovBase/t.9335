on various topics at the American Geophysical Union Meeting at the Moscone Convention Center MCC San Francisco December 8 12 http www jpl nasa gov releases 2003 165 cfm THE MARTIAN CLIMATE AS SEEN BY MARS ODYSSEY http www jpl nasa gov releases 2003 165 cfm MARS Odyssey spacecraft Item 1 Odyssey s sensors have measured the movement of carbon dioxide as it accumulates as frost at the winter poles and evaporates during the spring Intriguing images of this dry ice will be shown The Odyssey camera has obtained the most detailed map yet of the south Polar Regions Measurements of water ice in the soil suggest a complex layering indicating recent global climate change Enigmatic hydrogen deposits at warm mid latitudes will be discussed Results from the radiation monitoring experiment show the level of radiation hazard that Mars bound astronauts may face including that from intense solar activity recently measured by the instrument Press conference Monday December 8 noon EST The associated session P21A is Tuesday 11 a m EST in Room MCC 3002 http www gsfc nasa gov topstory 2003 1200coral html NASA LEARNING TO MONITOR CORAL REEF HEALTH FROM THE SKY http www gsfc nasa gov topstory 2003

satellites in the future according to a NASA scientist who is the principal investigator in a collaborative project to develop a method to remotely sense coral health Press Conference Monday December 08 2003 NASA MISSION TO JUPITER S ICY MOONS Jupiter Item 4 NASA s Project Prometheus is developing plans for the Jupiter Icy Moons Orbiter JIMO It will orbit Callisto Ganymede and Europa the three planet size moons of Jupiter that have ingredients necessary for life water energy and necessary chemicals JIMO will be the first spacecraft powered by nuclear electric propulsion Press conference Monday December 8 5 p m EST The associated session P11C is Monday December 8 1 20 p m EST in Room MCC 3009 http www gsfc nasa gov topstory 2003 1208toms html A SEASON IN THE LIFE OF THE ANTARCTIC OZONE HOLE TOMS satellite Item 3 NASA s Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer TOMS instruments have been looking at ozone and making daily maps of the ozone content of the atmosphere TOMS data has shown the evolution of the ozone hole since 1979 This instrument was an essential factor in establishing international agreements that led to the banning of ozone destroying chlorofluorocarbons Press conference Monday December 8 4 p m EST The associated sessions A11A A11G begin on today at 11 a m EST in Room MCC 3018 Poster Session A21D is Tuesday December 9 11 30 a m EST on MCC Level 2 http www

polar ice sheets clouds mountains forestlands and even fires all to help scientists understand how our changing climate affects life on Earth Press conference Tuesday December 9 6 p m EST Special sessions C31A and C31D detail these results on Wednesday December 10 at 11 a m EST in Room MCC 3010 HOW URBANIZATION IS IMPACTING CLIMATE coastal city Item 6 Scientists estimate by 2025 60 percent of the world s population will live in cities The urban environment can impact several aspects of the natural earth system This press conference will highlight some of the impact of urbanization on climate change including temperature changes rainfall modification and aerosol constituents The press conference is Thursday December 11 at 6 p m EST Associated sessions U51A on Friday December 12 at

millennia speakers will discuss the latest research involving climate reconstructions and different models Discussions include how researchers used a climate model that included solar radiation changes volcanic eruptions and natural internal variability to arrive at a more accurate look at Earth s changing climate Press conference Tuesday December 9 5 p m EST The associated session PP51
