subsurface inel gov Search default asp Researchers The Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory s Subsurface Science Initiative SSI is a major research undertaking to expand our understanding of subsurface contaminant fate and transport With more than fifty percent of the U S population depending on groundwater for their drinking water protecting aquifers from contamination is a national priority Responsibility for preventing surface and groundwater contamination is given to several federal agencies the Departments of Energy Interior and Agriculture the Environmental Protection Agency the Army Corps of Engineers among others as well as to state county and municipal agencies Because of a rapidly growing threat of aquifer contamination in our industrialized society each of these organizations needs dramatically improved technology to avert damage to our water supplies The INEEL s Subsurface Science Initiative SSI is a major research undertaking designed to help safeguard our precious groundwater supplies by applying science to a better understanding of subsurface processes and how they control the movement and degradation of contaminants in the subsurface over time The primary motivation for the Subsurface Science Initiative is to develop the scientific basis and new technology needed for the Department of Energy to remediate and monitor sites having radioactive and chemical contaminants in the ground as a result of research to develop weapons and peacetime uses of nuclear energy The SSI effort encompasses a broad range of scientific inquiry including geology geophysics hydrology biology chemistry and computational science to address nationwide environmental management issues A world class review board collaboration with governmental agencies working on groundwater problems and recommendations from the National Research Council guide the INEEL Program Our research focus includes development and validation of predictive models to guide programs aimed at preventing or remediating contamination robust waste contaminant systems to prevent contaminants from reaching groundwater supplies and reliable monitoring systems to provide early warning of problems before extensive damage is done We are developing new research capabilities and recruiting staff to advance subsurface investigations Multidisciplinary research teams are now conducting mesoscale experimental campaigns designed to mimic complex real world hydrological microbiological geochemical and geological subsurface processes Additionally we are planning a Subsurface Geosciences Laboratory user facility to enable experimental verification of predictive models testing of caps and barriers and development of new monitoring systems and sensors The Subsurface Science Initiative creates an exciting opportunity for scientists engineers and students to work in collaboration with INEEL personnel on cutting edge research into problems whose solutions are important for ensuring a clean safe environment for humanity and all life on earth Explore the opportunities and promises of the SSI through this web site Contacts P Michael Wright Ph D Initiative Director 208 526
