Solar Radiation Alert information CARI 6 The CARI 6 computer program developed at the FAA s Civil Aerospace Medical Institute calculates the effective dose of galactic cosmic radiation received by an individual based on an anthropomorphic phantom on an aircraft flying a great circle route or a reasonable approximation between any two airports in the world The program takes into account changes in altitude and geographic location during the course of a flight as derived from the flight profile entered by the user Deviations from a great circle route of up to 200 miles have very little effect on the flight dose Based on the date of the flight appropriate databases are used to account for effects of changes in the earth s magnetic field and MV solar activity heliocentric potentials on galactic radiation levels in the atmosphere The program also calculates reliable estimates of the effective dose rate from galactic radiation at any location in the atmosphere at altitudes up 60 000 feet The dose calculated by the CARI program DOES NOT include the radiation from the sun received during a a solar proton event The program requires MS DOS and can be run on most personal computers Of interest to epidemiologists CARI 6 calculates effective doses and dose rates back to January 1958 LUIN99 and LUIN2000 contain the theoretical transport code used to generate the databases referenced by CARI 6 These two LUINs are computationally identical same radiation doses particle fluxes etc LUIN2000 is more user friendly as a stand alone program Neither code calculates flight doses only dose rates at individual locations The transport code has been extensively tested against measurements INFORMATION ABOUT THE LATEST VERSION OF CARI 6 The current version of CARI 6 is dated January 30 2002 see upper left hand corner of MAIN MENU in the program We made changes in the help file and added a command line driven version for those interested in using the program in batch style processing see the readme

effective dose of galactic cosmic radiation received by an individual based on an anthropomorphic phantom on an aircraft flying a user specified route The main differences between CARI 6 and CARI 6M are a CARI 6 assumes a single great circle route between origin and destination airports With CARI 6M the user enters a route plan consisting of geographic coordinates and altitudes waypoints and the program assumes a great circle route between each successive pair of waypoints b After the first en route altitude CARI 6 combines time climbing or descending to a new en route altitude with time spent at that new altitude CARI 6M calculates the radiation dose received during any change in altitude INFORMATION ABOUT THE LATEST VERSION Decemeber 3 2001 OF CARI 6M The current version of CARI 6M is dated December 3 2001 see upper left hand corner of MAIN MENU in the program Important changes from the April 5 2001 version are additions to the HELP file and Airport database The maximum allowable number of waypoints has been increased to 1000 If you have comments or suggestions please contact us E mail address mailto wallace friedberg faa gov wallace friedberg faa gov DOWNLOAD A FREE

in galactic radiation levels that occur with changes in solar activity The program employs the user entered flight date to select the appropriate heliocentric potential from its database The program will prompt the user in entering heliocentric potentials for dates not already in the database There may be a lag of up to one month in availability of heliocentric potential data on our Web site To estimate flight doses during the current month use the most recent heliocentric potential available Do not use a heliocentric potential more than two months removed from the month of interest Flight doses for specific flight profiles normally change very little in a couple of months To compare CARI 6 or CARI 6M dose estimates with instrument measurements we recommend using heliocentric potentials appropriate for the days or hours of the measurements We will provide these heliocentric potentials on request Heliocentric Potentials for Recent Dates For flights in October 2002 10 2002 use
