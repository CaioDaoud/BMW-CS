website bio title NASA has a long history of transferring aerospace technology and methodology to the biomedical and biotechnology communities A few recent examples from here at NASA Glenn are heart assist pumps bone stress sensors and devices for early detection of cataracts NASA Glenn maintains a broad expertise applicable to the biomedical community spanning a myriad of technologies including instrumentation materials information technology fluid physics and portable power NASA Glenn is now has establisheding a new BioScience and Engineering Program informal initiative called BEGIN Bioscience and Engineering Glenn INitiative that expands and coordinates our efforts In the past the transfer of our knowledge and technology to biomedical concerns has been somewhat ad hoc and only recently has an emphasis been placed on interdisciplinary research that systematically combines our expertise in disciplines of physics chemistry biology and engineering for the widest possible benefit of future space missions and improved terrestrial products and processes BEGIN The BioScience and Engineering Program is composed of the following distinct programs with a range of purposes helping to assure astronaut health and their life support system performance exploring and nurturing basic research in new areas of high promise aiding other NASA Centers by providing our expertise in fluid physics transferring technology that has commercial potential to industries supporting small business innovative research and continuing a broad range of individual research projects with funding from other agencies such as the Department of Defense and the National Institutes of Health In support of these programs we are also expanding a series of academic training courses employing the expertise available through local institutions PROGRAM WHO WHAT http microgravity grc nasa gov grcbio bec html Biomedical Engineering Consortium BEC NASA Glenn National Center for Microgravity Research Case Western Reserve University Cleveland Clinic Foundation University Hospitals of Cleveland Inter institutional research and technology development beginning with ten projects in FY02 that are aimed at applying local expertise in fluid physics and sensor development to mitigate the risks of space flight on the health safety and performance of astronauts It is anticipated that several new technologies will be developed that are applicable to both medical needs in space and on earth http microgravity grc nasa gov grcbio SRF html Strategic Research Fund NASA Glenn research staff
