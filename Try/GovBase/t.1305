The NOAA Aeronomy Laboratory The NOAA Aeronomy Laboratory Advancing Our Understanding of the Earth s Atmosphere http www noaa gov NOAA logo Who We Are The WWWHD Pubdocs aeronomy html Aeronomy Laboratory AL is one of the twelve Laboratories in the http www oar noaa gov Office of Oceanic and Atmospheric Research OAR of the http www noaa gov National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration NOAA The Laboratories of OAR are located in several states from the East Coast to the West Coast The research areas of the individual Laboratories focus on particular aspects of the Earth system and on different research approaches with the common broad aim of improving the understanding and prediction of geophysical phenomena that relate to the well being of humankind Our Mission The ultimate aim of the Aeronomy Lab s research is to improve the capability to observe understand predict and protect the quality of the atmosphere The Aeronomy Laboratory conducts fundamental research on the chemical and physical processes of the Earth s atmosphere This research concentrates on the lower two layers of the atmosphere known as the troposphere and stratosphere see figure below Both the stratosphere and the troposphere have important direct and indirect effects on the well being of humankind In this century it has become increasingly clear that humans are influencing the chemical composition of the troposphere and stratosphere in ways that can impact conditions at the Earth s surface Some of the most challenging environmental issues of our time have arisen At the Aeronomy Lab over 120 scientists engineers students and supporting staff are engaged in studies of these issues working with colleagues from other institutions across the United States and around the world The Regions of the Atmosphere is described below The Regions of the Atmosphere The Earth s atmosphere has layers which are actually characterized by how the temperature of the atmosphere changes with altitude The troposphere begins at the Earth s surface which acts as a source of heat resulting from absorption of visible sunlight The temperature decreases with height in the troposphere and so the air is well mixed in this region Greek tropos a turning Weather phenomena such as thunderstorms and clouds occur in this layer as does most of the commercial airline traffic at present exceptions include the higher flying supersonic aircraft for example the Concorde Near about 9 12 kilometers 16 17 kilometers in the tropics a new region called the stratosphere begins The stratosphere is heated from above absorption of solar ultraviolet radiation by oxygen and ozone and temperature increases with altitude In this region there is much slower mixing Latin stratum layer The ozone layer resides in the stratosphere At about 50 kilometers 30 miles temperature begins to decrease with altitude again and the mesosphere begins As you explore the Aeronomy Laboratory Home Page you will undoubtedly expect to find much information about our scientific work We will meet that expectation but tell you more that perhaps will surprise you because an important part of our work entails a step beyond doing the science And that step is communicating our findings to those who need the information Our customers are many and varied including the general public government officials industry leaders and of course our scientific colleagues around the world Below is the story of our scientific research its relationship to issues of importance to society and our work to communicate our findings to our
