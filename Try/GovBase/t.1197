the announcement that a very strong candidate for a parent body has been discovered in the Quadrantid meteoroid stream This is our main meteor shower and until now the parent was thought to be lost from the stream The shower will be visilbe from the United States on upcoming early morning of Jan 04 2004 under relatively good circumstances More information http aio arc nasa gov leonid EH1 pdf here FIRST RESULTS 2003 LEONIDS The first reports on the 2003 Leonid shower are posted watch html here The 1499 dust trail about 17h UT on Nov 13 was apparently confirmed by Japanese visual observers albeit not as intense as predicted by Esko Lyytinen A broad peak the Filament with ZHR about 50 was observed around November 19 as predicted by Peter Jenniskens Other minor trails at 7h UT 1533 and 17h UT 1733 could not yet be confirmed due to lack of data Clouds interfered with many observing plans LATEST ON PROSPECTS FOR 2003 LEONIDS estimator html applet to calculate expected activity from your site http aio arc nasa gov leonid vaub leo offprint pdf Latest dust trail models 1998 html overview of expected activity This year s Leonids will not see a repeat of the storms of past years That said there are two outbursts predicted that offer exciting opportunities for viewing Esko Lyytinen predicts that on November 13 16h UT Earth will cross the dust trail ejected in 1499 six days prior to the main maximum Peter Jenniskens and Hans Betlem predict that on November 19 there will be a broad Perseid like shower of bright Leonid meteors lasting about a day Jeremie Vaubaillon points out that at 07 27 UT that day an old dust trail from 1533 will be near Earth orbit 2003 DRACONIDS No increased Draconid activity was observed in the evening of October 7 when Earth was predicted to encounter the 1887 dust trail of comet 21P Giacobini Zinner at around 19h UT Esko Lyytinen or 18 10 UT Jeremie Vaubaillon Little was known about the anticipated activity workshopgroupphoto thumb jpg group photo

http leonid arc nasa gov workshop 2003 Leonid MAC Workshop at NASA Ames Research Center CA The shock in meteor images has been confirmed The organic signature reported during the 1999 mission in infrared spectra is confirmed There turns out to be a large diversity in comet meteoroid composition and morphology New molecules have been detected in meteor emissions and there is now an answer to the long standing press release 8 html mystery of persistent trains A report with much more news will follow 2002 URSIDS DEC 22 Look for a possible enhancement of the Ursid meteor shower activity between 18 h and 21 h UT on December 22nd says Esko Lyytinen of Finland There is a chance that dust ejected in 1090 may encounter Earth Unfortunately the parent comet early orbit uncertainties grow quickly when we compare for example the returns around 1100 to leonidnews28 html those near 1400 Moreover these very old trails are expected to be badly distorted and clumpy in nature No ZHR predictions are possible at this time AND OUTBURSTS FROM EARTH THREATENING COMETS Looking further into the future Esko Lyytinen and Peter Jenniskens have a http aio arc nasa gov leonid ICARUSLP final pdf paper in press in the journal ICARUS that predicts the meteor outbursts from Earth threatening long period comets The first possible outbursts are due on February 08 and March 01 2003 leonidnews html Further Leonid news items mainpage recent updates html LEONID MAC mission news Now the storms are over there will be no more Leonid MAC missions Instead ground based observations are planned to detect the predicted dust trail encounters in 2003 which pertain to twice the age of dust trails studied so far Because of that they will also be less intense and more difficult to detect If detected they will provide ground truth for the development of dust trail models http aio arc nasa gov leonid 2002DC8group jpg Group photo DC8 team 2002 NASA DC 8 Airborne Laboratory crew and scientists http

IMAGES The NASA and USAF sponsored 2002 Leonid MAC mission was a great success Both aircraft were above clouds and under perfect conditions for viewing both of the 2002 Leonid storms enroute from Torrejon Spain to Offutt AFB near Omaha Nebraska All instruments worked as expected and aurora moon and meteors made the view scenic and truely spectacular at times First reports can be found here
