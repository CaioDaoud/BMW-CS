years from Earth In 2002 docs dict ad html astronomy astronomers obtained a deep Chandra observation that shows ripples in the gas filling the cluster These ripples are evidence for sound waves that have traveled hundreds of thousands of light years away from the cluster s central black hole We have observed the prodigious amounts of light and heat created by black holes now we have detected the sound said Andrew Fabian of the Institute of Astronomy IoA in Cambridge England and leader of the study In musical terms the pitch of the sound generated by the black hole translates into the note of B flat But a human would have no chance of hearing this cosmic performance because the note is 57 octaves lower than middle C by comparison a typical piano contains only about seven octaves At a docs

are much more than just an interesting form of black hole acoustics said Steve Allen also of the IoA and a co investigator in the research These sound waves may be the key in figuring out how galaxy clusters the largest structures in the universe grow Allen said For years astronomers have tried to understand why there is so much hot gas in galaxy clusters and so little cool gas Hot gas glowing with docs dict qz html X ray X rays should cool and the dense central gas should cool the fastest The pressure in this cool central gas should then fall causing gas further out to sink in toward the galaxy forming trillions of docs dict qz html star stars along the way Scant evidence has been found for such a flow of cool gas or star formation This forced astronomers to invent several different ways to explain why the gas contained in clusters remained hot and until now none of them was satisfactory Heating caused by a central black hole has long been considered a good way to prevent cluster gas from cooling Although docs dict jp html jets jets have been observed at docs dict qz html radio radio docs dict qz html wavelength wavelengths their effect on cluster gas was unclear since this gas is only detectable in X rays and early X ray observations did not have Chandra s ability to find detailed structure Videos news PERSEUS sm web mov Animation of sound waves generated in Perseus

CXC IoA A Fabian et al Previous Chandra observations of the Perseus cluster showed two vast bubble shaped cavities in the cluster gas extending away from the central black hole Jets of material pushing back the cluster gas have formed these X ray cavities which are bright sources of radio waves They have long been suspected of heating the surrounding gas but the mechanism was unknown The sound waves seen spreading out from the cavities in the recent Chandra observation could provide this heating mechanism A tremendous amount of energy is needed to generate the cavities as much as the combined energy from 100 million docs dict qz html supernova supernovae Much of this energy is carried by the sound waves and should dissipate in the cluster gas keeping the gas warm and possibly preventing a cooling flow If so the B flat pitch of the sound wave 57 octaves below middle C would have remained roughly constant for about 2 5 billion years Perseus is the brightest docs dict ad html cluster of galaxies cluster of galaxies in X rays and therefore was a perfect Chandra target for finding sound waves rippling through the hot cluster gas Other clusters show X ray cavities and future Chandra observations may yet detect sound waves in these objects index html Home docs science science html Imagine Science docs features exhibit exhibits html Special Exhibit docs sats n data sats n
