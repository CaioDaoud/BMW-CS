CIO Search Page Search Page Catalog of Infrared Observations There are three ways to interactively access the data in the on line Catalog view Browse the Catalog scroll through the Catalog listings search Access the Catalog data by source name criteria Search the Catalog listings by specifying position wavelength flux You can access the database of bibliographic references for each Catalog data entry biblio Search the Bibliography of Infrared Astronomy 1 Browse the Catalog Listings Use this option to browse through the main Catalog listings as if reading a book This is by far the simplest way to access the infrared database without complicated search procedures To open the Catalog click a green button below The Catalog listings for that hour of RA will be displayed You can scroll up and down through the listings using the mouse or the up down arrow keys Select an hour of RA as a starting point http ircatalog gsfc nasa gov cio browse 00browse html 00 http ircatalog gsfc nasa gov

headings 2 Access the Catalog Data by Source Name It can be difficult to locate a source in the Catalog simply by typing its name because source names and spellings are not standardized and names are often abbreviated in the database However all of the object names contained in the database are listed alphabetically in an Atlas of Infrared Sources which is a supporting tool built into the Catalog Two effective ways of finding an object in the Catalog by name using the Atlas are provided here a Open the Catalog to the page containing the source name of interest Click on the red button to find the source name in the Atlas The Atlas name listed is a link to the source location in the Catalog Click on the link to display the Catalog page containing the source then you can scroll up and down to identify all records for that source This option provides an efficient way to find the source in the Catalog browse listings html Locate Source b Create a summary of Catalog data for the source name of interest You can restrict the search results to those records falling within 2 arcminutes of the source of interest and create a shorter list of records for sources within that search area by using the green button below Choose a source name to generate a summary of the observations within a small region of sky around that source This option returns Catalog listings for all sources within 2 arcminutes of RA and Dec including observations of other sources in the region create summary html Locate Source 3 Search the Catalog Listings by Specifying Position Wavelength Flux This search option creates a summary of all Catalog database records meeting the search criteria you establish below Any one or any combination of the search fields below can be used to limit your search It is not necessary to specify all fields For example if the Right Ascension Declination and R A DEC range are not specified the entire sky will be searched This will result in a longer search time but will result in a complete survey based on the specified parameters Click on search help html SEARCH PARAMETER HELP or the individual links below for an explanation of the format of each search parameter search help html Position Right Ascension hh mm ss or hh mm or hh search help html Range R A Search Range hr R A min R A sec R A You may change the value by typing any range search help html Position Declination dd mm ss or dd mm or dd search help html Range Dec Search Range degrees arcmin arcsec You may change the value by typing any range Under gif UNDER CONSTRUCTION THE EQUINOX OPTION IS UNDER CONSTRUCTION Equinox At the present time the Catalog uses equinox 1950 coordinates An option to enter positions based on a different equinox and return the search results in the equinox specified will be implemented in the future UNDER CONSTRUCTION search help html Wavelength Wavelength Enter the range limits of the wavelength search in the two boxes below To restrict the search to a single wavelength enter it in the From box To search over a range of wavelenghts enter beginning and ending values in the FROM and TO boxes A search over a range of wavelengths is NON INCLUSIVE For examples and options click on search help html Wavelength Wavelength Help From m To m search help html Flux Flux Enter the range limits of the flux search in the two boxes below To restrict the search to a single flux enter it in the From box To search over a range of fluxes enter beginning and ending values in the FROM and TO boxes A search over a range of fluxes is NON INCLUSIVE For examples and options click on search help html Flux Flux Help From Units of flux can be specified below To search help html Units Units of Flux NOTE A search can be made for data in specific UNITS without specifying the FLUX above The vast majority of units listed in the Catalog are either Magnitudes or Janskys If you don t specify the UNITS OF FLUX the search will return all listings however most will be either Magnitudes or Janskys with only a few of the less commonly used units The less commonly used units are identified below and explained further in search help html Units Units Help Relative
