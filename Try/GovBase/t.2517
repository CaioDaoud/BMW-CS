an eight year coal mine employment history but the ALJ only found four years of such employment C Physicians qualifications 1 Treating or examining physician a Prior to applicability of December 2000 regulations In Consolidation Coal Co v Director OWCP Held 314 F 3d 184 4th Cir 2002 the court held that it was improper to accord great weight to the opinion of a physician merely because he treated Claimant and examined him each year over the past ten years The court stated the following The ALJ s treatment of Dr Tsai Claimant s treating physician was inconsistent with the law In Grizzle v Pickands Mather and Co 994 F 2d 1093 4th Cir 1993 we clearly stated that n either this circuit nor the Benefits Review Board has ever fashioned either a requirement or a presumption that treating or examining physicians opinions be given greater weight than the opinions of other expert physicians citations omitted That statement is still true today Thus while Dr Tsai s opinion may have been entitled to special consideration it was not entitled to the great weight accorded it by the ALJ In Wolf Creek Collieries v Director OWCP Stephens 298 F 3d 511 6th Cir 2002 F2 2 the court held that the ALJ properly accorded greater weight to the opinion of the miner s treating physician who examined the miner on numerous occasions from 1981 through 1989 as opposed to the opinions of employer s physicians who never examined the miner or who only examined the miner once in 1981 Citing to Tussey v Island Creek Coal Co 982 F 2d 1036 6th Cir 1993 the court stated that the opinions of treating physicians are not presumed to be entitled to greater weight but they must be properly weighed and credited Further although the court found that the amended regulatory provisions at 20 C F R 718 104 d were not directly applicable because the evidence was developed prior to January 19 2001 it did state that these provisions were instructive In particular the amended regulations provide that In appropriate cases the relationship between the miner and his treating physician may constitute substantial evidence in support of the adjudication officer s decision to give that physician s opinion controlling weight provided that the weight given to the opinion of a miner s treating physician shall be on the credibility of the physician s opinion in light of its reasoning and documentation other relevant evidence and the record as a whole Slip op at 10 In Jericol Mining Inc v Director OWCP Napier 301 F 3d 703 6th Cir 2002 the court cited to its decision in Stephens which is summarized above to hold that the factors set forth at 20 C F R 718 104 d 5 2001 are relevant for determining the appropriate weight that should be assigned to the opinions of treating physicians However the court concluded that the ALJ did not properly discuss each of the factors before according the treating physician s opinions greater weight i e nature and duration of relationship and frequency and extent of treatment The court then determined that the same factors that justify placing greater weight on the opinions of a treating physician are appropriate considerations in determining the weight to be given an examining physician s views In this vein the court concluded that the ALJ did not provide sufficient reasoning to accord greater weight to the opinion of Dr Baker who examined the miner four times over a four year period of time as opposed to the opinion of Dr Dahhan who examined the miner twice over the same time period The court noted that the problem with the ALJ s analysis is that he did not specifically consider whether the four annual examinations by Dr Baker were materially different from the two examinations that Dr Dahhan performed during the same time frame The court reasoned that this would render claimants unable to stack the deck by frequently visiting a physician who provided a favorable diagnosis and then arguing that the opinion of that examining physician should automatically be accorded greater weight In Peabody Coal Co v Groves 277 F 3d 829 6th Cir 2002 the Sixth Circuit held that it was proper for the ALJ to accord greater weight to the opinion of a miner s treating physician Citing to its decision in Tussey v Island Creek Coal Co 982 F 2d 1036 6th Cir 1993 the court stated that treating physicians opinions may be entitled to greater weight than the opinions of other physicians of record but it noted that ALJs are not required to credit treating doctors opinions either standing alone or where there is conflicting proof in the record The court cited to the amended regulatory provisions at 20 C F R 718 104 d 5 2000 which provide that weight accorded to the treating physician s opinion must also be based on the credibility of the physician s opinion in light of its reasoning and documentation and other relevant evidence as a whole In Gray v Peabody Coal Co Case No 01 3083 6th Cir Apr 19 2002 unpublished the Sixth Circuit held that the ALJ erred in according greater weight to the consultative opinions of Drs Fino and Branscomb over the opinion of a treating physician on grounds that Drs Fino and Branscomb had superior credentials Citing to Tussey v Island Creek Coal Co 9982 F 2d 1036 6th Cir 1993 the court held that an ALJ may discount a treating physician s opinion if it is not well reasoned or well documented or is problematic in some other way However the court stated that w here the ALJ determines that the treating physician s opinion is well reasoned and well documented the ALJ must give more weight to that opinion than to those of other physicians even where those other physicians have superior qualifications In Peabody Coal Co v Odom F 3d Case No 02 0385 6th Cir Aug 25 2003 the court held that a treating physician s opinion that the miner suffered from coal workers pneumoconiosis was entitled to additional weight because 1 the treating physician was a highly qualified board certified pulmonary specialist 2 he treated the miner for 16 years and wrote probative and persuasive medical reports and 3 he had extensive treatment notes from 1980 through 1996 The court noted that the ALJ properly considered the other medical reports of record but determined that the treating physician s report was well documented and well reasoned In Eastover Mining Co v Williams F 3d Case No 00 0362 BLA 6th Cir July 31 2003 a case filed prior to promulgation of the December 2000 regulatory amendments the court held that the opinion of a treating physician is not automatically entitled to greater weight simply because of the physician s status and as a result the court retreated from its holding in Tussey v Island Creek Coal Co 982 F 2d 1036 6th Cir 1993 that a physician s opinion should be accorded controlling weight The court cited with approval the amended regulatory provisions at 20 C F R 718 204 d 2001 stating that a simple principle is evident in black lung litigation the opinions of treating physicians get the deference they deserve based on their power to persuade In this case the court found that while the treating physician had an almost certainly benevolent intent towards the miner s family the fact that he did not diagnose pneumoconiosis during 14 years of treatment but only after the miner allegedly died from it rendered the physician s conclusion dubious 2 Non examining or consultative physician By unpublished decision in Consolidation Coal Co v Director OWCP Wasson Case No 98 1533 4th Cir Nov 13 2001 the court upheld the ALJ s use of the American Medical Association s Guides to the Evaluation of Permanent Impairment to conclude that a miner s single breath diffusing capacity DLCO study was abnormal Turning to medical opinion evidence the court noted that i n his practice of pulmonary medicine Dr Rasmussen had examined some 24 000 to 25 000 miners and the employer conceded on the record that he is an expert in his field Dr Rasmussen found that the miner suffered from obstructive and restrictive impairments arising from coal dust exposure and smoking The court determined that his opinion was supported by the objective medical data of record On the other hand the court agreed that Dr Fino s opinion was entitled to less weight Dr Fino concluded that the miner did not suffer from a restrictive or interstitial disease because his diffusing capacity values were normal which rules out the presence of clinically significant pulmonary fibrosis and pneumoconiosis is an example of a pulmonary fibrosis However the ALJ properly found that the diffusing capacity values were abnormal according to the AMA guidelines and therefore Dr Fino s conclusions were accorded less weight In Freeman United Coal Mining Co v Summers 272 F 3d 473 7th Cir 2001 the court upheld the ALJ s weighing of the medical opinion evidence concluding that the ALJ properly accorded greater weight to the opinion of Dr Cohen particularly in light of his remarkable clinical experience and superior knowledge of cutting edge research The court also found that the ALJ properly gave less weight to the opinions of Dr Fino based on a finding that they were not supported by adequate data or sound analysis Of importance the court made reference to the comments to the amended regulations and stated the following Dr Fino stated in his written report of August 30 1998 that there is no good clinical evidence in the medical literature that coal dust inhalation in and of itself causes significant obstructive lung disease citation omitted During a rulemaking proceeding the Department of Labor considered a similar presentation by Dr Fino and concluded that his opinions are not in accord with the prevailing view of the medical community or the substantial weight of the medical and scientific literature Slip op at n 7 Citation updated Chester v Hi Top Coal Co BRB No 00 1000 BLA July 31 2001 unpub F3 3 3 Criminal conviction of the physician See also Middlecreek Coal Co v Director OWCP 91 F 3d 132 4th Cir 1996 Matney v Lynn Coal Co 995 F 2d 1063 4th Cir 1993 D Equivocal or vague conclusions In Kentland Elkhorn Coal Corp v Director OWCP Hall 287 F 3d 555 6th Cir 2002 the Sixth Circuit applied the amended regulatory provisions at 20 C F R 718 204 b 2002 and affirmed the ALJ s finding that the miner s total disability was due to coal workers pneumoconiosis In so holding the court concluded that the ALJ properly accorded greater weight to the opinions of Drs Saha Younes and Sikder over the contrary opinion of Dr Fino on grounds that Dr Fino s opinion was equivocal or vague In particular Dr Fino concluded that the degree of the miner s obstruction could not be determined but then concluded that the miner could return to his usual coal mine work The court found that Dr Fino s conclusion that the miner could return to his previous coal mine employment to be problematic given that Dr Fino stated that he could not measure the level of the miner s obstruction On the other hand the court found that each of the remaining physicians conducted a thorough examination of the miner and found that he was totally disabled The court noted that c ombined with the fact that Hall s previous work in the coal mines required heavy exertion and exposure to large amounts of dust the ALJ properly concluded that Hall was totally disabled as 20 C F R 718 204 b 1 defines that term In Amax Coal Co v Director OWCP Chubb 312 F 3d 882 7th Cir 2002 a case arising under Part 727 the court held that the ALJ properly discredited the opinion of Dr Meyers as too equivocal The court noted that Dr Meyers found that the miner suffered from a significant limitation but it appeared more cardiac than pulmonary E Silent opinion As a point of clarification in Toler v Eastern Assoc Coal Co 43 F 2d 109 4th Cir 1995 the Fourth Circuit held that it was clear that a physician s opinion regarding disability causation carries little weight if s he has not diagnosed pneumoconiosis contrary to the ALJ s finding of the disease At the very least an ALJ who has found or has assumed arguendo that a claimant suffers from pneumoconiosis and has total pulmonary disability may not credit a medical opinion that the former did not cause the latter unless the ALJ can and does identify specific and persuasive reasons for concluding that the doctor s judgement on the question of disability causation does not rest upon her disagreement with the ALJ s finding as to either or both of the predicates in the causal chain However in Hobbs v Clinchfield Coal Co 45 F 3d 819 4th Cir 1995 the court carefully circumscribed the Toler holding In this vein the Fourth Circuit noted that the concept of legal pneumoconiosis at 20 C F R 718 201 is broader than the phrase coal workers pneumoconiosis First 718 201 includes coal workers pneumoconiosis as only one of several possible ailments which could satisfy the legal definition of pneumoconiosis Furthermore the comparative breadth of the legal definition contained in 718 201 is indicated by its inclusion of certain disorders which medically are different from pneumoconiosis Although all of the disorders explicitly mentioned in 718 201 are medically similar what is important is that a medical diagnosis finding no coal workers pneumoconiosis is not equivalent to a legal finding of no pneumoconiosis Clearly the legal definition of pneumoconiosis contained in 718 201 is significantly broader than the medical definition of coal workers pneumoconiosis As a result the court held that it was improper to accord little weight to the opinions of physicians who concluded that the miner did not suffer from coal workers pneumoconiosis contrary to the ALJ s findings that the miner suffered from the disease as defined at 718 201 of the regulations Specifically the court stated that the medical conclusions of Drs Sargent and Kress that Hobbs is not impaired by coal workers pneumoconiosis do not necessarily conflict with the ALJ s legal conclusion that Hobbs suffers from pneumoconiosis The court found that Drs Sargent and Kress attributed the miner s respiratory problems to coal dust exposure but they concluded that his disability arose from skeletal problems rather than from pneumoconiosis See also Dehue Coal Co v Director OWCP Ballard 65 F 3d 1189 4th Cir 1995 physicians concluded that smoking induced lung cancer caused the miner s respiratory or pulmonary impairment and that the miner did not suffer from coal workers pneumoconiosis this was not contrary to the ALJ s finding that the miner suffered from simple pneumoconiosis within the meaning of 718 201 such that physicians opinions entitled to consideration coal workers pneumoconiosis is only one of many ailments which would satisfy the legal definition of pneumoconiosis In Scott v Mason Coal Co 289 F 3d 263 4th Cir 2002 the court held that the ALJ erroneously accorded greater weight to the opinions of Drs Castle and Dahhan who found that the miner s disability was not caused by coal workers pneumoconiosis because the physicians concluded that the miner did not suffer from the disease contrary to the ALJ s findings Citing to Toler v Eastern Assoc Coal Co 43 F 3d 109 4th Cir 1995 and Grigg v Director OWCP 28 F 3d 416 4th Cir 1994 the court stated the following A n ALJ who has found or has assumed arguendo that a claimant suffers from pneumoconiosis and has total respiratory disability may not credit a medical opinion that the former did not cause the latter unless the ALJ can and does identify specific and persuasive reasons for concluding that the doctor s judgment on the questions of disability causation does not rest upon her disagreement with the ALJ s finding as to either or both of the predicates in the causal chain The fact that Drs Dahhan and Castle stated that their opinions would not change even if the miner suffered from pneumoconiosis did not alter the court s position that the opinions could carry little weight pursuant to its holding in Toler Both Dr Dahhan and Dr Castle opined that Scott did not have legal or medical pneumoconiosis did not diagnose any condition aggravated by coal dust and found no symptoms related to coal dust exposure Thus their opinions are in direct contradiction to the ALJ s finding that Scott suffers from pneumoconiosis arising out of his coal mine employment bringing our requirements in Toler into play Under Toler the ALJ could only give weight to those opinions if he provided specific and persuasive reasons for doing so and those opinions could carry little weight at most Indeed the court found that the opinions of Drs Dahhan and Castle could not outweigh a contrary poorly documented opinion linking the miner s disability to his pneumoconiosis because the contrary opinion was based on a finding of coal workers pneumoconiosis consistent with the ALJ s findings In Abshire v D L Coal Co 22 B L R 1 BRB No 01 0827 BLA Sept 30 2002 en banc the Board held that although Dr Broudy based his opinion regarding the etiology of the miner s total disability on a finding that the miner did not suffer from coal workers pneumoconiosis it was error for the ALJ to accord the opinion less probative value where Dr Broudy also opined that even if claimant suffered from coal workers pneumoconiosis his opinion with respect to claimant s pulmonary difficulties would not change In Amax Coal Co v Director OWCP Chubb 312 F 3d 882 7th Cir 2002 the court held that the ALJ properly discounted Dr Tuteur s opinion that pneumoconiosis did not contribute to the miner s total disability because Dr Tuteur s opinion was based on a finding that the miner did not suffer from the disease contrary to the ALJ s findings which were supported by substantial evidence G Better supported by objective medical data By unpublished decision in Consolidation Coal Co v Director OWCP Wasson Case No 98 1533 4th Cir Nov 13 2001 the court upheld the ALJ s use of the American Medical Association s Guides to the Evaluation of Permanent Impairment to conclude that a miner s single breath diffusing capacity DLCO study was abnormal Turning to medical opinion evidence the court noted that i n his practice of pulmonary medicine Dr Rasmussen had examined some 24 000 to 25 000 miners and the employer conceded on the record that he is an expert in his field Dr Rasmussen found that the miner suffered from obstructive and restrictive impairments arising from coal dust exposure and smoking The court determined that his opinion was supported by the objective medical data of record On the other hand the court agreed that Dr Fino s opinion was entitled to less weight Dr Fino concluded that the miner did not suffer from a restrictive or interstitial disease because his diffusing capacity values were normal which rules out the presence of clinically significant pulmonary fibrosis and pneumoconiosis is an example of a pulmonary fibrosis However the ALJ properly found that the diffusing capacity values were abnormal according to the AMA guidelines and therefore Dr Fino s conclusions were accorded less weight In Freeman United Coal Mining Co v Summers 272 F 3d 473 7th Cir 2001 the court concluded that the ALJ properly gave less weight to the opinions of Dr Fino based on a finding that they were not supported by adequate data or sound analysis Of importance the court made reference to the comments to the amended regulations and stated the following Dr Fino stated in his written report of August 30 1998 that there is no good clinical evidence in the medical literature that coal dust inhalation in and of itself causes significant obstructive lung disease citation omitted During a rulemaking proceeding the Department of Labor considered a similar presentation by Dr Fino and concluded that his opinions are not in accord with the prevailing view of the medical community or the substantial weight of the medical and scientific literature Slip op

Medical literature and studies In Freeman United Coal Mining Co v Summers 272 F 3d 473 7th Cir 2001 the court concluded that the ALJ properly gave less weight to the opinions of Dr Fino based on a finding that they were not supported by adequate data or sound analysis Of importance the court made reference to the comments to the amended regulations and stated the following Dr Fino stated in his written report of August 30 1998 that there is no good clinical evidence in the medical literature that coal dust inhalation in and of itself causes significant obstructive lung disease citation

the court upheld the ALJ s use of the American Medical Association s Guides to the Evaluation of Permanent Impairment to conclude that a miner s single breath diffusing capacity DLCO study was abnormal A conflict arose in the interpretation of the test Dr Rasmussen questioned the lower predicted value used by Dr Bercher s laboratory in the 1991 test stating that he believed that the claimant s diffusing capacity on that test would be abnormal if a higher predicted value was used Thus a controversy arose as to whether the claimant s actual performance on the 1991 test was within normal or abnormal range i e whether the lower predicted value was in fact the appropriate or correct value against which to measure the claimant s test result Id The ALJ properly notified the parties that the AMA guidelines would be used to determine the proper predicted value for the test Employer objected to the use of the AMA guides because inter laboratory differences would render the AMA guidelines unreliable The court disagreed however and held that the guide already takes such differences into account Consequently the court concluded that the employer had adequate notice yet offered no specific evidence to show that the use of the AMA guide was unfair or inaccurate when applied to the case at hand By unpublished decision in Bethenergy Mines Inc v Director OWCP Rowan Case No 01 2148 4th Cir Sept 4 2002 the Fourth Circuit upheld the ALJ s finding that Dr Rasmussen s opinion that the miner s centrilobular emphysema was caused by or aggravated by coal dust exposure was entitled to greater weight than contrary opinions of record The court stated the following The ALJ explained that he found Dr Rasmussen s testimony most persuasive because Dr Rasmussen offered extensive research to support his opinion Dr Rasmussen cited seven articles from medical journals and six epidemiologic studies to support his position No other doctor offered such extensive research In his opinion ALJ Burke offered concrete reasons for discounting the opinions of other doctors who were critical of Dr Rasmussen He noted that Dr Renn s testimony lacked the definitiveness to outweigh the better reasoned and better supported report of Dr Rasmussen Dr Kleinerman s disagreement with the medical experts Dr Rasmussen cited were in the most general of terms Dr Kleinerman did not critique any particular study or any specific data behind a study Furthermore the ALJ found that Dr Fino s criticisms of studies cited by Dr Rasmussen are insufficient to dismiss the studies that support Dr Rasmussen s opinion because while Dr Fino disputed the underlying data of studies offered by Dr Rasmussen he did not specify which studies of Dr Ruckley had evidentiary problems Further the ALJ stated that Dr Fino doesn t contend that Dr Rasmussen is incorrect in his interpretation of a study supporting the relationship between coal dust exposure and centrilobular emphysema While Dr Fino discussed a more recent study that purported to support his position he did not identify the study by title or author Slip op at 8 citations omitted N CT scan evidence new In Consolidation Coal Co v Director OWCP Stein 294 F 3d 885 7th Cir 2002 the Seventh Circuit upheld the ALJ s award of benefits In reaching this determination the court rejected Employer s argument that d espite the fact that two qualified B readers including a board certified radiologist determined that Stein s x rays were positive Dr Bruce s negative reading of Stein s CT scan is conclusive because it ostensibly is the most sophisticated and sensitive diagnostic test available Citing to comments underlying the amended regulations the court noted that the Department has rejected the view that a CT scan by itself is sufficiently reliable that a negative result effectively rules out the existence of pneumoconiosis 65 Fed Reg 79 920 79 945 Dec 20 2000 The court concluded that the ALJ reasonably accorded less weight to the negative CT scan interpretation by a physician without any radiological qualifications as compared to the positive chest x ray interpretations by physicians who are B readers and one physician who his also a board certified radiologist O Reliance on testing which is later interpreted to the contrary new In Furgerson v Jericol Mining Inc 22 B L R 1 BRB No 01 0728 BLA Sept 24 2002 en banc the Board held that the ALJ did not reconcile a physician s diagnosis of pneumoconiosis based upon the positive x ray and the miner s significant duration of coal dust exposure with the fact that Dr Baker s positive interpretation was reread as negative by a physician with superior qualifications As a result the Board directed that the ALJ address whether this rereading impacts the physician s opinion and his diagnosis of pneumoconiosis II Autopsy reports A Principles of weighing autopsy evidence In Thomas v Director OWCP BRB No 01 0308 BLA Dec 11 2001 unpub F5 5 the Board held that it was proper to discredit Dr Jones s opinion based on his review of autopsy slides because it was totally at variance with the findings reported by Drs Potter and Green In Livermore v Amax Coal Co 297 F 3d 668 7th Cir 2002 the Seventh Circuit upheld the ALJ s finding that coal workers pneumoconiosis did not hasten the miner s death based on autopsy evidence because the ALJ reviewed all the opinions qualifications of the experts and resolved the conflicting reports in a thorough and logical manner In Consolidation Coal Co v Director OWCP Kramer 305 F 3d 203 3d Cir 2002 F6 6 the court upheld the ALJ s award of benefits based on a preponderance of the autopsy evidence Employer maintained that the ALJ improperly considered an autopsy report which did not contain a microscopic description of the lungs in violation of the quality standards at 20 C F R 718 106 a Citing to the Board s decision in Dillon v Peabody Coal Co 11 B L R 1 113 1 114 and 1 115 1988 the court concluded that a lthough the regulations require that the report include a microscopic description of the lungs they contain no express requirements in the form or nature thereof The court noted that the autopsy report stated that the microscopic findings were consistent with i e confirmed the gross autopsy findings and incorporated by reference the detailed findings contained elsewhere in the report As a result the court

20 C F R 725 101 a 32 in Freeman United Coal Mining Co v Summers 272 F 3d 473 7th Cir 2001 the court utilized the 125 day rule to determine the miner s length of coal mine employment In satisfying this requirement the court stated the following Summers was not required to establish that he worked underground for more than 125 days per annum See Landes v Director OWCP 997 F 2d 1192 1198 7th Cir 1993 quoting Yauk v Director OWCP 912 F 2d 192 195 8th Cir 1989 Nor did he have to prove that he was around surface coal dust for a full eight hours a day on any given day for that day to count towards the 125 day total citation omitted All that Summers had to show was that he worked in or around a coal mine for any part of 125 days in a calendar year for a total of 15 years This he unquestionably did by demonstrating that he was exposed to worked related dust five or six days each week from May 1948 to April 1965 and from April 1975 to October 1980 On this record we conclude that the ALJ properly invoked the 15 year presumption In ARMCO Inc v Martin 277 F 3d 468 4th Cir 2002 the court applied the pre amendment provisions at 20 C F R 725 493 a 1 1999 to hold that the 125 day rule may only be used to determine the proper responsible operator and it cannot be used to determine the claimant s length of coal mine employment for purposes of the entitlement presumptions at 20 C F R 718 301 F7 7 In this vein the court noted that 20 C F R 725 493 b 1999 provides a two step inquiry in determining whether the named operator is properly responsible for the payment of benefits Under the first step a court must determine whether a miner worked for an operator for a period of one year or partial periods totaling one year 20 C F R 725 493 b 1999 If the court determines that this one year requirement has been met it must then undertake the second inquiry of whether a miner s employment during that one year was regular i e whether during the one year the miner was regularly employed in or around a coal mine Id at 474 In particular the court found that the regulations provide that responsible operator liability does not arise unless an operator employed a miner for one calendar year during which the miner regularly worked for that operator defining regularly worked to be a minimum of 125 days In support of its position the court cited to Board and circuit court decisions which reached the same result Croucher v Director OWCP 20 B L R 1 68 1 72 to 1 73 1998 Northern Coal Co v Director OWCP 100 F 3d 871 876 10th Cir 1996 and Director OWCP v Gardner 882 F 2d 67 71 3rd Cir 1989 The court noted that the Third Circuit explained that This two step inquiry means that the one year employment requirement sets a floor for the operator s connection with the miner below which the operator cannot be held responsible for the payment of benefits The 125 day limit relates to the minimum amount of time the miner may have been exposed to

1192 1195 7th Cir 1993 and Yauk v Director OWCP 912 F 2d 192 195 8th Cir 1989 that if a miner works for 125 days then s he will be credited with one year of coal mine employment for purposes of 20 C F R 725 301 1999 In Clark v Barnwell Coal Co 22 B L R BRB Nos 01 0876 BLA and 02 0280 BLA Apr 30 2003 the ALJ calculated the length of coal mine employment for purposes of determining the proper responsible operator using three different methods The Board stated that 20 C F R 725 493 b 2000 contemplates a two step inquiry into the miner s employment to determine if an employer is the responsible operator The inquiry is as follows First the administrative law judge must determine whether the miner worked for an operator for one calendar year or partial periods totaling one calendar year Then if the administrative law judge finds that the threshold one year requirement is met the administrative law judge must determine whether the miner s employment was regular citations omitted Thus a mere showing of 125 working days does not establish one year of coal mine employment citations omitted In determining the length of the miner s coal mine employment the administrative law judge may apply any reasonable method of calculation citation omitted Under the first method to calculate length of coal mine employment the ALJ compared the miner s earnings with Barnwell Coal Company Barnwell for 1978 and 1979 against earnings with other coal operators during the same time period The Board found this method to be problematic and unexplained and concluded that a finding that the miner s Barnwell wages exceeded his wages from other coal mine employment of undefined duration during 1978 and 1979 does not establish that he worked a calendar year for Barnwell Under the second method the ALJ utilized a Bureau of Labor Statistics BLS table to determine that the miner worked for Barnwell for a period of one year The Board noted that u pon review of the BLS table utilized by the administrative law judge it is apparent that the yearly figures set forth in column two and relied upon by the administrative law judge are not based on a one year employment period but represent only 125 days of earnings The Board then reiterated that 125 working days does not establish the threshold one year of coal mine employment The Board determined that this method of calculating length of coal mine employment was unreasonable The third method of calculating length of coal mine employment utilized by the ALJ was under 20 C F R 725 101 a 32 iii Here the ALJ determined the total amount of wages earned by Claimant during the year for Barnwell and divided that amount by the coal mine industry s average daily earnings reported at column three of the BLS table which produced the number of days the miner would have worked for the year The ALJ concluded that the miner worked a total of 206 days for Barnwell using this method of calculation The Director asserted on appeal that the ALJ should have then divided the total of 206 days by 125 to determine the part of the year devoted to coal mine employment The Director stated that when 206 days is divided by 125 then it demonstrates that the miner worked 1 64 years for Barnwell The Board noted the following Although the additional computation suggested by the Director appears nowhere in 20 C F R 725 101 a 32 iii the Director argues that the need for it is obvious in order to ascertain the fractional year where a miner has worked fewer than 125 days citation omitted In support of this interpretation the Director cross references 20 C F R 725 101 a 32 i which provides in part that where a calendar year of employment is established but the miner actually worked fewer than 125 working days in a year he or she has worked in a fractional year based on the ratio of the actual number of days worked to 125 The Board disagreed with the Director s approach and held the following For purposes of determining the threshold one year requirement we conclude that the Director s interpretation of 20 C F R 725 101 a 32 iii is not reasonable because it collapses the two step analysis required by 20 C F R 725 493 b 2000 to determine whether one year of employment is established The suggested formula at 20 C F R 725 101 a 32 iii as written yields the number of days actually worked in coal mine employment That total here is 206 days In dividing this number by 125 the Director confuses the threshold inquiry of whether the miner had a calendar year of employment with the second stage inquiry of whether having actually worked 125 days as a miner or credited with a fractional year having working worked fewer than 125 days as a miner during the year Here by contrast the question is whether the threshold calendar year has been established In this context dividing the number of days worked by 125 effectively credits the miner with a year of coal mine employment if he or she worked 125 days contrary to the standard that a mere showing of 125 working days does not establish the threshold one year of employment Based on the ALJ s finding of 206 days of employment as a miner for Barnwell the Board concluded that the miner did not meet the requirement of working for a cumulative period of one year for the employer F8 8 Consequently the Board concluded that substantial evidence did not support a finding that Barnwell employed the miner for as least one year as required at 20 C F R 725 493 a and b 2000 E Periods included in computing length of coal mine employment 1 Vacation time a Prior to

cited in Chapter 6 Section III E In Kentland Elkhorn Coal Corp v Director OWCP Hall 287 F 3d 555 6th Cir Apr 24 2002 the Sixth Circuit initially found that Desperado Fuels was not the responsible operator as it did not employ Claimant for a period of one year In so holding the court concluded that time spent receiving disability benefits should be excluded in computing the length of time Claimant worked for Employer Specifically the miner worked for Desparado Fuels from March 6 1989 to July 7 1989 He suffered a work related injury and received disability benefits from July 8 1989 until June 12 1990 The court held that the time period during which the miner received disability benefits could not be used to satisfy the requirement of one year of employment with Desperado Fuels Distinguishing the Board s holding in Boyd v Island Creek Coal Co 8 B L R 1 458 1986 the court noted that the miner in Boyd was kept on the payroll after his injury and continued to work for the employer after the injury In the present case Claimant quit working for Desparado Fuels after his injury and he did not even work for the company for 125 days prior to his injury The court then determined that the ALJ erroneously dismissed the other named operators Coleman and Grassy Creek Upon review of the evidence the court concluded that these entities had a predecessor successor relationship and the Claimant worked for the entities for more than one year However because the claim was fully litigated on the merits and Claimant was determined to be entitled to benefits the court found that the parties would be prejudiced by a remand to the ALJ to designate Coleman Grassy Creek as the proper responsible operator As a result the court dismissed Kentland from the case and held that the Black Lung Disability Trust Fund was liable for the payment of benefits J Due process rights of the employer violated Trust Fund held liable for payment of benefits 2 Delay in notice of claim In Amax Coal Co v Director OWCP Chubb 312 F 3d 882 7th Cir 2002 the court concluded that a 16 year delay in the adjudication of the miner s claim from the time of the 1978 filing to the 1994 order by the Board to start afresh did not constitute a violation of Employer s due process rights As a result Employer s request to transfer liability to the Black Lung Disability Trust Fund was denied Citing to C K Coal Co v Taylor 165 F 3d 254 3d Cir 1999 the court noted that Employer received timely notification of the claim and had been able to develop its evidence even though the delayed processing of the claim was inexcusable The court distinguished the holdings in Consolidation Coal Co v Borda 171 F 3d 175 183 4th Cir 1995 and Lane Hollow Coal Co v Director OWCP 137 F 3d 799 4th Cir 1998 where the Fourth Circuit transferred liability to the Black Lung Disability Trust Fund because of the Department s inordinate delay in notifying the employers of the viability of a claim and their potential liability for the payment of benefits The court noted that in Borda and Lane Hollow the due process rights of the employers were denied when the defendants had not received timely notice of the proceeding and that under the facts in Chubb Amax received notice of and participated in all of the proceedings dealing with Mr Chubb s claim since 1978 bbb10 htm Chapter 10 Living

305 F 3d 203 3d Cir 2002 F9 9 Employer challenged that a finding that pneumoconiosis was progressive in this case because the miner s pulmonary function and blood gas studies up to two and one half years preceding his death were within normal limits such that pneumoconiosis could not have hastened the miner s death Employer noted that the miner was diagnosed with colon cancer which had metastasized to his liver and lungs and which caused the miner s death The court stated that the tenet that pneumoconiosis is non progressive is simply inconsistent with the assumption of disease progressivity that underlies much of the statutory regime Moreover the court stated that even assuming that the disease was not progressive the absence of a clinically significant pulmonary impairment two and one half years prior to the miner s death certainly does not establish that Kramer had incurred no damage to his lung tissue and no pulmonary burden of any degree whatsoever as a result of his occupational exposure The court further noted that nothing in the evidence that Consolidation points to would negate the conclusion that a preexisting pulmonary burden albeit insufficient standing alone to result in measurable loss of lung function could nonetheless in combination with a further affront to the pulmonary system through advancing cancer have decreased to some degree the lungs ability to continue to compensate 3 Evidence relevant to finding pneumoconiosis a Anthracosis and anthracotic pigment By unpublished decision in Taylor v Director OWCP BRB No 01 0837 BLA July 30 2002 unpublished the Board noted that a physician concluded on autopsy that no coal workers pneumoconiosis was present and yet he also stated that there was minimal anthracosis in the mediastinal lymph nodes As a result the Board remanded the case to the ALJ to determine whether the legal definition of pneumoconiosis at 20 C F R 201 which includes anthracosis was satisfied The Board held that anthracosis found in lymph nodes may be sufficient to establish the existence of pneumoconiosis Updated citation Hapney v Peabody Coal Co 22 B L R 1 106 2001 en banc B Regulatory methods of

Circuit the Board declined to apply the Fourth Circuit s holding in Island Creek Coal Co v Compton 211 F 3d 203 4th Cir 2000 which required that a determination of the presence of pneumoconiosis be based on weighing all types of evidence under 20 C F R 718 202 together Rather the Board noted that the Sixth Circuit has often approved the independent application of the subsections of Section 718

R BRB No 02 0365 BLA Feb 12 2003 the Board upheld the ALJ s equivalency determination that a 1 5 centimeter lesion on autopsy would constitute a 1 0 centimeter or greater opacity on a chest x ray thus establishing the presence of complicated pneumoconiosis under 20 C F R 718 304 In support of the ALJ s finding the Director argued that the autopsy prosector and a reviewing pathologist found a lesion larger than one centimeter in the miner s lungs The Director stated that although another reviewing pathologist Dr Naeye found a 0 9 centimeter lesion on the slides this would not disprove the existence of a nodule larger than one centimeter in the miner s lungs The Director noted that one of Employer s experts Dr Kleinerman acknowledged that a tissue sample shrinks by about 10 15 when prepared for a slide See also Hawker v Zeigler Coal Co B L R BRB No 99 0434 BLA Aug 23 2000 By unpublished decision in Keene v G A Coal Co BRB No 96 1689 BLA A Sept 27 1996 the Board affirmed a finding of complicated pneumoconiosis under 20 C F R 718 304 It held that the ALJ properly found that a chest x ray in conjunction with CT scan findings was sufficient to find complicated pneumoconiosis The ALJ specifically noted that physicians reviewing a CT scan confirm ed the presence of a large irregular density or mass greater than one centimeter in diameter The Board further held that a finding of complicated pneumoconiosis need not be accompanied by findings of Category 2 or Category 3 simple pneumoconiosis contrary to Employer s argument The Board also found that the ALJ properly concluded that Dr Wheeler s opinion that claimant s large opacity is compatible with tuberculosis did not negate its compatibility with complicated pneumoconiosis 2 Fifteen years of coal mine employment In Freeman United Coal Mining Co v Summers 272 F 3d 473 7th Cir 2001 the court held that the ALJ properly invoked the 15 year presumption at 30 U S C 921 c 4 having found that the miner s work at the surface of the mine was under conditions substantially similar to those in an underground coal mine The ALJ found similarity based on the miner s un refuted testimony about his employment conditions The miner worked as an electrician in the mines during some of his coal mine employment but most of his work occurred when he worked inside the offices and shops that were built above ground on the coal company s property The court found that the miner described in detail the dusty conditions in his work areas and it noted the following Summers intermittently labored underground or in buildings located atop subterranean coal mines performing tasks inexorably intertwined with coal production Therefore he is a miner according to the regulations and we will not require him to prove similarity in a different manner merely because he did not wield a pickaxe and a shovel while he worked Id IV Etiology of the pneumoconiosis In Wisniewski v Director OWCP 929 F 2d 952 3d Cir 1991 the court held that an inference that the miner s pneumoconiosis was caused by coal dust exposure may be raised if the record affirmatively indicates that there was no other potential dust exposure V Establishing total disability C Methods of demonstrating total disability 4 Reasoned medical opinions a Burden of proof Citation correction The assessment of medical opinion evidence has been re codified from former section 718 204 c 4 to the amended 718 204 b 2 iv 2000 VI Etiology of total disability A Contributing cause standard In Scott v Mason Coal Co 289 F 3d 263 4th Cir 2002 the court held that the ALJ erroneously accorded greater weight to the opinions of Drs Castle and Dahhan who found that the miner s disability was not caused by coal workers pneumoconiosis because the physicians concluded that the miner did not suffer from the disease contrary to the ALJ s findings Citing to Toler v Eastern Assoc Coal Co 43 F 3d 109 4th Cir 1995 and Grigg v Director OWCP 28 F 3d 416 4th Cir 1994 the court stated the following A n ALJ who has found or has assumed arguendo that a claimant suffers from pneumoconiosis and has total respiratory disability may not credit a medical opinion that the former did not cause the latter unless the ALJ can and does identify specific and persuasive reasons for concluding that the doctor s judgment on the questions of disability causation does not rest upon her disagreement with the ALJ s finding as to either or both of the predicates in the causal chain The fact that Drs Dahhan and Castle stated that their opinions would not change even if the miner suffered from pneumoconiosis did not alter the court s position that the opinions could carry little weight pursuant to its holding in Toler Both Dr Dahhan and Dr Castle opined that Scott did not have legal or medical pneumoconiosis did not diagnose any condition aggravated by coal dust and found no symptoms related to coal dust exposure Thus their opinions are in direct contradiction to the ALJ s finding that Scott suffers from pneumoconiosis arising out of his coal mine employment bringing our requirements in Toler into play Under Toler the ALJ could only give weight to those opinions if he provided specific and persuasive reasons for doing so and those opinions could carry little weight at most Indeed the court found that the opinions of Drs Dahhan and Castle could not outweigh a contrary poorly documented opinion linking the miner s disability to his pneumoconiosis because the contrary opinion was based on a finding of coal workers pneumoconiosis consistent with the ALJ s findings 2 After applicability of December 2000 regulations In Tennessee Consolidated Coal Co v Director OWCP Kirk 264 F 3d 602 6th Cir 2001 the Sixth Circuit interpreted the amended provisions at 20 C F R 718 204 c 2000 which provide that pneumoconiosis is a substantially contributing cause to the miner s total disability if it ii Materially worsens a totally disabling respiratory or pulmonary impairment which is caused by a disease or exposure unrelated to coal mine employment 20 C F R 718 204 c 2000 Under the facts presented to the court Employer argued that the miner s chronic obstructive pulmonary disease was primarily if not entirely a consequence of the estimated quarter of a million cigarettes he had smoked Said differently Employer maintained that there is no substantial evidence that Kirk s total disability which was not caused by pneumoconiosis in 1988 had suddenly become caused by this disease in 1992 The court found that under the amended regulatory provisions the mere fact that Claimant s non coal dust related respiratory disease would have left him totally disabled even without exposure to coal dust this would not preclude entitlement to benefits The court held that Claimant may nonetheless possess a compensable injury if his pneumoconiosis materially worsens this condition By unpublished decision in Pittsburgh Midway Coal Mining Co v Sanchez 2001 WL 997947 Case No 00 9538 10th Cir Aug 31 2001 the court declined to apply the causation standard set forth in the amended regulations at 20 C F R 718 204 c 1 and stated

of onset for the payment of benefits was not the date on which the miner retired from working in the coal mines Rather the court cited to 20 C F R 725 503 which requires that if the date of onset cannot be determined from the medical evidence then it is the date on which the miner filed his claim which in this case is August 1978 The court then noted that the miner returned to coal mine work in September 1981 for a period of one year Pursuant to 20 C F R 725 504 formerly 20 C F R 725 503A the court determined that the payment of benefits would be suspended for that period of time Employer argued that the regulatory provisions regarding onset were invalid because they were in conflict with Section 7 c of the Administrative Procedure Act APA To the contrary the court held that the

to determine whether the miner s medical bills were related to his respiratory impairment arising from coal dust exposure Employer argued that the regulations adopted the Fourth Circuit s presumption set forth in Doris Coal Co v Director OWCP Stiltner 938 F 2d 492 4th Cir 1991 which was specifically rejected by the Sixth Circuit in Seals v Glen Coal Co 147 F 3d 502 6th Cir 1998 Citing to the district court s ruling in United Mining Ass n v Chao 160 F Supp 2d 47 D D C 2001 the Board upheld the validity of the revised regulation which provides that any pulmonary disorder for which treatment is required is presumed to be caused or aggravated by the miner s condition The Board further noted that Employer s burden to defend against the compensability of the disputed expenses has not been altered Turning to the merits of the case the Board upheld the ALJ s finding that the miner s hospitalization was related to his coal dust induced lung disease notwithstanding the fact that the records did not specifically reflect treatment for pneumoconiosis The ALJ noted that the miner s chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and chronic bronchitis had been found to be related to coal dust exposure and therefore because his hospitalization records reflected treatment for such a disease the costs were compensable Moreover it was proper to give little weight to Dr Branscomb s opinion that the medical expenses were not compensable because his opinion was premised on a finding that the miner did not suffer from legal pneumoconiosis In Kenner v Tennessee Consolidated Coal Co 22 B L R 1 BRB No 02 0594 BLA June 27 2003 the ALJ concluded that the miner was entitled to reimbursement for costs associated with a lung transplant The Board upheld the ALJ s ruling that statutory and regulatory provisions which require that Employer furnish all medical treatment for conditions arising out of coal mine employment are controlling over the Department of Labor s Provider Manual that excluded organ transplants from coverage The Board concluded that the Manual does not rise to the level of interpretive rules or formal policy Rather the Manual contains informal instructional guidelines that do not have the force and effect of law and the fact finder has discretion to determine based on the facts of each case whether or not a lung transplant constitutes a covered procedure under the Act and the regulations However the Board remanded the case holding that Employer was entitled to a hearing on the contested issue of whether the miner s lung transplant was reasonable and necessary to treat the miner s pneumoconiosis pursuant to the standard enunciated in Glen Coal Co v Seals 147 F 3d 502 6th Cir 1998 since the case arose in that circuit Consequently the case was

v Peabody Coal Co F 3d Case No 01 4358 6th Cir June 2 2003 the Sixth Circuit held that the ALJ has decision making authority over the determination of whether a black lung benefits claim exists but that jurisdiction for the enforcement of agency orders lies in the district courts pursuant to 30 U S C 934 B 4 A Under the facts of the case the miner was overpaid black lung benefits during his lifetime as the result of falsifying his receipt of state benefits Upon his death his spouse was automatically entitled to survivor s benefits The survivor and Employer negotiated an agreement to the effect that any future survivor s benefits owed to the spouse by Peabody Coal would be setoff against the amount of overpayment The district director subsequently reinstated survivor s benefits and Employer objected to the payment of these benefits The district director referred the matter to this Office for adjudication but the ALJ determined that he was without jurisdiction to decide the matter of collection and reimbursement The court agreed stating that Employer did not challenge the survivor s entitlement to benefits rather Employer sought enforcement of the negotiated agreement which provided that survivor s benefits would be offset by the amount of overpaid benefits in the living miner s claim Horizontal Rule bbb23 htm Chapter 23 Petitions for Modification Under 725 310 Back to Top Back to Top Horizontal Rule II Procedural issues D Exclusion of evidence on modification By unpublished decision in Andrews v Director OWCP BRB No 02 0228 BLA Dec 23 2002 a case involving

medical report was available and could have been submitted at the time of the original hearing The Board agreed with Claimant and the Director who argued that the ALJ should not have excluded Dr

Manufacturing Co BRB No 97 1121 June 26 1998 unpub wherein the Board held that the ALJ erred in admitting evidence on modification as part of the Director s exhibits where the evidence was in

administrative law judge s discretion to order that a claimant be re examined on modification The Board stated that the issue to be determined by the administrative law judge is whether the employer has raised a credible issue pertaining to the validity of the original adjudication such that an order compelling a claimant to submit to examinations or tests would be in the interest of justice F12 12 Moreover the Board held that because the district director listed modification as an issue on the CM 1025 the parties need not move to amend the CM 1025 to specifically include the medical issues

Employer petition for Section 22 modification was its second It petitioned for modification of an award of survivor s benefits based in part on evidence which could have been submitted at the original hearing or during an earlier modification proceeding The ALJ denied Employer s petition for modification as not in the interest of justice under the Act She reasoned that all of the evidence that Old Ben proffered or attempted to obtain in the second modification proceeding had been available during the first modification proceeding and that a modification proceeding is not intended to allow a party to simply retry its case when it thinks it can make a better showing by presenting evidence that it could have but did not present earlier t o do so would allow the Employer under the guise of an allegation of mistake to retry its case simply because it feels that it can make a better showing the next time around Old Ben appealed to the Benefits Review Board who affirmed the ALJ decision The Board held that the ALJ acted within her discretion by finding that reopening the case would not render justice under the Act The Board reasoned that Old Ben is bound by the actions of its original counsel no matter how negligent or incompetent and that a party dissatisfied with the actions of its freely chosen counsel has a separate action against such counsel in another forum Old Ben appealed to the Seventh Circuit The Director Office of Workers Compensation Programs filed a brief in support of the position of Old Ben arguing that the ALJ and the Board applied the incorrect legal standard that the ALJ should be required to reopen the matter and reevaluate the award of benefits The Director argued to the Court that a timely requested modification of a mistaken decision should be denied only if the moving party has engaged in such contemptible conduct or conduct that renders its opponent so defenseless that it could be said that correcting the decision would not render justice under the Act The Seventh Circuit accepted the position of Old Ben and the Director It found that it owed the usual deference to the Director given by Courts to agencies that interpret its own statutes and regulations The Court cited the Supreme Court decisions in Banks v Chicago Grain Trimmers Ass n 390 U S 459 1968 and O Keefe v Aerojet General Shipyards Inc 404 U S 254 1972 for the employment of a broad reading of Section 22 to permit reconsideration of the ultimate question of fact without submitting any new evidence The Court determined that the language structure and case law interpreting Section 22 articulates a preference for accuracy over finality in the substantive award The Court held that whether requested by a miner or an employer a modification request cannot be denied out of hand based solely on the number of times modification has been requested or on the basis that the evidence may have been available at an earlier stage in the proceeding The Court discussed the factors to be considered in determining whether granting modification serves justice under the Act we do not believe that only sanctionable conduct constitutes the universe of actions that overcomes the preference for accuracy For example just as the remedial purpose of the Act would be thwarted if an ALJ were required to brook sanctionable conduct the purpose also would be thwarted if an ALJ were required to reopen proceedings if it were clear from the moving party s submissions that reopening could not alter the substantive award So too an ALJ would be entitled to determine that an employer was employing the reopening mechanism in an unreasonable effort to delay payment In making that determination the ALJ will no doubt need to take into consideration many factors including the diligence of the parties the number of times that the party has sought reopening and the quality of the new evidence which the party wishes to submit These and other factors deemed relevant by the ALJ in a particular case ought to be weighed not under an amorphous interest of justice standard but under the frequently articulated justice under the Act standard O Keefe 404 U S at 255 This distinction is not simply one of semantics The latter formulation cabins the discretion of the ALJ to keep in mind the basic determination of Congress that accuracy of determination is to be given great weight in all determinations under the Act The Court reiterated that finality simply is not a paramount concern of the Act and a remand of the case is required because the ALJ gave no credence to the statute s preference for accuracy over finality Horizontal Rule bbb24 htm Chapter 24 Multiple Claims Under 725 309 Back to Top Back to Top Horizontal Rule I Generally In Peabody Coal Co v Odom F 3d Case No 02 3085 6th Cir Aug 25 2003 the court held that pneumoconiosis is a progressive and latent disease which can arise and progress even in the absence of continued exposure to coal dust IV Proper review of the record A Prior to applicability of December 2000 regulations material change in conditions In Tennessee Consolidated Coal Co v Director OWCP Kirk 264 F 3d 602 6th Cir 2001 the Sixth Circuit held that under Sharondale Corp v Ross 42 F 3d 993 6th Cir 1994 it is insufficient for the ALJ to merely analyze the newly submitted evidence to determine whether an element previously adjudicated against the claimant has been established Rather the court stated that the ALJ must also compare the sum of the newly submitted evidence against the sum of the previously submitted evidence to determine whether the new evidence is substantially more supportive of claimant Although the ALJ did not conduct a comparison of the old and new evidence to determine whether the new evidence was substantially more supportive the court nevertheless affirmed the finding of material change as supported by the record as a whole VI Affect of three year statute of limitations In Tennessee Consolidated Coal Co v Director OWCP Kirk 264 F 3d 602 6th Cir 2001 the Sixth Circuit held that under proper circumstances the three year statute of limitations for filing a black lung claim at 20 C F R 725 308 c would apply to the filing of a subsequent claim under 20 C F R 725 309 Under the facts before it the court determined that the miner had not received a reasoned medical opinion finding him totally disabled due to pneumoconiosis which would have commenced the running of the limitation period The court stated the following The three year limitations clock begins to tick the first time that a miner is told by a physician that he is totally disabled by pneumoconiosis This clock is not stopped by the resolution of a miner s claim or claims and pursuant to Sharondale the clock may only be turned back if the miner returns to the mines after a denial of benefits There is thus a distinction between premature claims that are unsupported by a medical determination like Kirk s 1979 1985 and 1988 claims and those claims that come with or acquire such support Medically supported claims even if ultimately deemed premature because the weight of the evidence does not support the elements of the miner s claim are effective to begin the statutory period F14 14 Three years after such a determination a miner who has not subsequently worked in the mines will be unable to file any further claims against his employer although of course he may continue to pursue pending claims Slip op at 5 italics in original By unpublished decision in Peabody Coal Co v Director OWCP Dukes 2002 WL 31205502 6th Cir Oct 2 2002 unpub F15 15 the Sixth Circuit held that a subsequent claim filed by a miner under 20 C F R 725 309 is not barred by the three year statute of limitations at 725 308 a because denial of the miner s first claim on grounds that he did not suffer from pneumoconiosis necessarily renders any prior medical opinion to the contrary invalid The court reaffirmed its holding in Tennessee Consolidated Coal Co v Director OWCP Kirk 264 F 3d 602 6th Cir 2001 that the three year statute of limitations does apply to subsequent claims However the Kirk court also stated that prior medical opinions in the miner s favor which were premature because the weight of the evidence did not support entitlement in an earlier claim were effective to begin the statutory period The Dukes court concluded that this was dicta and held otherwise Specifically the Dukes court adopted the Tenth Circuit s holding in Wyoming Fuel Co v Director OWCP Bandolino 90 F 3d 1502 1507 10th Cir 1996 and concluded the following We agree with the reasoning of the Tenth Circuit and likewise expressly hold that a mis diagnosis does not equate to a medical determination under the statute That is if a miner s claim is ultimately rejected on the basis that he does not have the disease this finding necessarily renders any prior medical opinion to the contrary invalid and the miner is handed a clean slate for statute of limitation purposes If he later contracts the disease he is able to obtain a medical opinion to that effect which then re triggers the statute of limitations In other words this statute of repose does not commence until a proper medical determination Slip op at 5 In Furgerson v Jericol Mining Inc 22 B L R 1 BRB No 01 0728 BLA Sept 24 2002 en banc F16 16 a case arising in the Sixth Circuit the Board remanded the case for a determination of whether the statute of limitations applied to the miner s subsequent claim which was filed under 20 C F R 725 309 Citing to Tennessee Consolidated Coal Co v Kirk 264 F 3d 602 6th Cir 2001 which was issued after the ALJ issued his decision and order Employer argued that the miner s claim was time barred pursuant to 20 C F R 725 308 because it was not filed within three years of the date that Dr Kabani s medical determination of total disability due to pneumoconiosis was communicated to the miner The Board initially noted that there is a presumption that every claim for benefits is timely filed but Employer has the opportunity to rebut that presumption It concluded that the ALJ must determine 1 whether Dr Kabani s opinion meets the requirements of 20 C F R 725 308 a and 2 whether a medical opinion with meets the requirements of 725 308 but like Dr Kabani s opinion is rejected as unpersuasive in a prior claim proceeding would prevent the statute of limitations from running The Board concluded that if the ALJ determines that the subsequent claim is untimely filed then he must give claimant the opportunity to prove that extraordinary circumstances exist that may preclude the dismissal of the claim 20 C F R 725 308 c The Board issued a related decision in Abshire v D L Coal Co 22 B L R 1 BRB No 01 0827 BLA Sept 30 2002 en banc a case also arising in the Sixth Circuit In Chaffin v Peter Cave Coal Co 22 B L R 1 BRB No 02 0643 BLA June 17 2003 Employer argued that the miner s duplicate claim was untimely under 20 C F R 725 308 because it was not filed within three years of a physician s opinion diagnosing the miner with totally disabling pneumoconiosis The Board held however that Employer waived this argument because it withdrew its contest of the issue at the hearing before the ALJ after the Sixth Circuit issued Tennessee Consolidation Coal Co v Kirk 264 F 3d 602 6th Cir 2001 On the merits of the multiple claim the Board held that the ALJ did not determine whether the newly submitted evidence differs qualitatively from the previously submitted evidence as required by Sharondale Corp v Ross 42 F 3d 993 6th Cir 1994 since the case arose in that circuit As a result the case was remanded to the ALJ for further consideration Horizontal Rule bbb25 htm Chapter 25 Principles of

1950 III Res judicata and collateral estoppel B Collateral estoppel 2 Examples of application f Miner s and survivor s claims existence of pneumoconiosis In Zeigler Coal Co v Director OWCP Villain 312 F 3d 332 7th Cir 2002 the court applied the concent of offensive nonmutual issue preclusion to hold that an employer was collaterally estopped from re litigating the issue of pneumoconiosis in a survivor s claim where the disease was established in the miner s lifetime claim and no autopsy evidence was submitted When deciding that Eugene was disabled by pneumoconiosis the agency necessarily concluded that he had that disease and as this is one element of the widow s claim too it makes sense to treat it as established Although the widow was not a party to the miner s claim Zeigler itself was Treating Zeigler as bound by the outcome is a straightforward application of offensive nonmutual issue preclusion In Collins v Pond Creek Mining Co B L R Case No 02 0329 BLA Jan 28 2003 the Board held that generally an employer is collaterally estopped from re litigating the issue of whether pneumoconiosis is present if 1 there is a prior decision awarding benefits in a miner s claim and 2 no autopsy is performed in the survivor s claim However the Board upheld the ALJ s denial of application of collateral estoppel where the miner was awarded benefits on February 25 1988 at which time evidence sufficient to establish pneumoconiosis under one of the four methods set out at Section 718 202 a 1 4 obviated the need to do so under any of the other methods The ALJ properly noted that since the award of miner s benefits the Fourth Circuit issued Island Creek Coal Co v Compton 211 F 3d 203 4th Cir 2000 requiring that all types of evidence be weighed together to determine whether the disease is present As a result the Board held that the issue is not identical to the one previously litigated and collateral estoppel does not apply In assessing the x ray evidence the ALJ excluded certain interpretations submitted by Employer on grounds that the employer had an opportunity to submit those readings in the living miner s claim The Board held that this was error and reasoned that s ince the survivor s claim is a separate claim and this evidence was admitted into the record at the hearing without objection by any party pursuant to 20 C F R 725 456 2000 it must be weighed with all other relevant evidence of record In Zeigler Coal Co v Director OWCP Villain 312 F 3d 332 7th Cir 2002 the court held that an employer is collaterally estopped from re litigating the existence of coal workers pneumoconiosis in a survivor s claim where the miner was awarded benefits based on a lifetime claim and no autopsy evidence is presented in the survivor s claim In this vein the court noted the following Not all kinds of black lung are progressive the milder forms of the condition do not get worse over time unless the miner inhales more dust Yet unless pneumoconiosis sometimes goes into remission there is no reason to hold a new hearing on the question whether a person who had that condition during life also had it at death Zeigler does not offer us and did not introduce before the agency any medical evidence suggesting that black lung can be cured Radiologists frequently disagree about the interpretation of x ray films only for the most serious forms of the disease are the opacities indicative of pneumoconiosis easy to distinguish from opacities with other causes Death offers a considerably better source of evidence analysis of the lung tissue removed in an autopsy The Benefits Review Board therefore has created an autopsy exception to the rule of issue preclusion Both a mine operator and a survivor are allowed to introduce autopsy evidence in an effort to show that the determination made during the miner s life was incorrect As a result the court held that because no autopsy evidence was submitted in the survivor s claim Employer was collaterally estopped from re litigating the issue of whether the miner suffered from coal workers pneumoconiosis By unpublished decision in Howard v Valley Camp Coal Co BRB No 00 1034 BLA Aug 24 2001 the Board circumscribed application of collateral estoppel to preclude re litigation of the existence of pneumoconiosis in a survivor s claim in a case arising in the Fourth Circuit The Board stated the following S ubsequent to the issuance of the award of benefits in the miner s claim the Fourth Circuit held that although Section 718 202 a enumerates four distinct methods of establishing pneumoconiosis all types of relevant evidence must be weighed together to determine whether a miner suffers from the disease See Island Creek Coal Co v Compton 211 F 3d 203 4th Cir 2000 see also Penn Allegheny Coal Co v Williams 114 F 3d 22 3d Cir 1997 In light of the change in law enunciated in Compton the issue of whether the existence of pneumoconiosis ha been established pursuant to Section 718 202 a which the administrative law judge found precluded in the survivor s claim pursuant to the doctrine of collateral estoppel is not identical to the one previously litigated and actually determined in the miner s claim citations omitted Thus inasmuch as each of the prerequisites for application of the doctrine of collateral estoppel is not present we hold that the doctrine of collateral estoppel is not applicable in this survivor s claim regarding the existence of pneumoconiosis pursuant to 20 C F R 718 202 a As a result the case was remanded to the administrative law judge for reconsideration of the evidence under 718 202 a of the regulations Horizontal Rule bbb26 htm Chapter 26 Motions Back to Top Back to Top Horizontal Rule VII Dispose of a claim A Withdrawal In Clevenger v Mary Helen Coal

not awarded In Childers v Drummond Co B L R BRB No 01 0585 BLA June 20 2002 en banc Judges McGranery and Hall dissenting the miner s and survivor s claims were filed prior to January 19 2001 and as a result the Board denied an award of pre controversion attorney s fees In so holding the Board noted that imposition of pre controversion attorney fees on employers may be made only where the district director has initially denied benefits as an adversarial relationship arises at that point F19 19 The Board further stated that in a case where the district director initially awards benefits a claimant cannot receive pre controversion attorney s fees The Board reasoned that no adversarial relationship arises unless and until employer controverts the award and therefore claimant has no reason to seek professional assistance in pursuing the claim Moreover the Board determined that an employer s controversion of a miner s claim is separate and distinct from its controversion in a survivor s claim and the controversions do not merge Claimants are liable for fees incurred prior to the employer s receipt of the formal notice of claim notice of its potential liability and subsequent refusal to pay compensation III Amount of the fee award B Necessary work defined Sentence correction However in Kerns v Consolidation Coal Co 247 F 3d 133 4th Cir 2001 the Fourth Circuit

enhancement based upon unique circumstances c Risk of loss and contingency multipliers In Pennsylvania v Delaware Valley Citizen s Council for Clean Air 107 S Ct 3078 1987 the Supreme Court considered an award of attorney s fees for successful prosecution of a claim under the Clean Air Act The Court noted that delay and the risk of nonpayment are often mentioned in the same breath but that adjusting for the former is a distinct issue that is not involved in this case The Court further stated that w e do not suggest however that adjustments for delay are inconsistent with the typical fee shifting statute Turning to an enhancement for risk of loss the Court held that such an enhancement under fee shifting statutes should be utilized only under exceptional circumstances It reasoned as follows P ayment for the time and effort involved the lodestar is presumed to be the reasonable fee authorized by the statute the enhancement for the risk of nonpayment should be reserved for exceptional cases where the need and justification for such enhancement are readily apparent and are supported by the evidence in the record and specific findings by the courts Id at 3088 The Board has generally held that enhancement for risk of loss in black lung claims is inappropriate See Gibson v Director OWCP 9 B L R 1 149 1986 Helton v Director OWCP 6 B L R 1 176 1983 risk of loss is a constant factor in black lung litigation and is therefore deemed incorporated into the hourly rate In recent cases the Fourth Circuit has declined to use a contingency multiplier to account for the risk of loss in black lung claims In Broyles v Director OWCP 974 F 2d 508 4th Cir 1992 the court declined to consider risk of loss to enhance a fee award and stated the following A multiplier is not necessary to encourage attorneys to handle black lung litigation These cases are argued before our court almost every term While some of these claims are unsuccessful the claimants win a sufficient number to encourage lawyers to handle this type of litigation through the administrative proceedings and into the federal court Id at 510 See also Simkins v Director OWCP 53 F 3d 329 4th Cir 1995

s fee for Sandra Fogel based on an hourly rate of 200 00 In support of its holding the court noted that Ms Fogel filed affidavits by various black lung attorneys nationwide who stated that 200 per hour was reasonable in light of Ms Fogel s expertise a letter from the vice president of the local bar association stating that the fee was reasonable in the area and the fact that Ms Fogel was awarded that hourly rate in 22 out of 27 fee applications she filed with various ALJs and the Benefits Review Board In Braenovich v Cannelton Industries Inc B L R BRB No 02 0365 BLA Feb 12 2003 the Board upheld an hourly rate of 200 where the ALJ properly considered the factors at 20 C F R 725 366 b including the high quality of counsel s representation her professional credentials and experience and the complex issues involving complicated pneumoconiosis presented in the case F20 20 VALIDATION OF REGULATIONS The Department s amended black lung regulations challenged by the National Mining Association were upheld by the D C Circuit Court of Appeals in National Mining Ass n et al v Dep t of Labor 292 F 3d 849 D C Cir 2002 with the exception of a few provisions found to be impermissibly retroactive and a cost shifting provision found to be invalid 1 Retroactivity a Affirmed Upon review of the challenged regulations the court held that the following provisions were not impermissibly retroactive the treating physician rule at 20 C F R 718 104 d is not retroactive because it codifies judicial precedent and does not work a substantive change in the law the amended definition of pneumoconiosis at 20 C F R 718 201 a 2 which provides that legal pneumoconiosis may include any chronic restrictive or obstructive pulmonary disease arising out of coal mine employment is not impermissibly retroactive because it does not create any presumption that an obstructive impairment is coal dust related rather it is the claimant s burden to establish that his her restrictive or obstructive lung disease arose out of coal mine employment the amended provisions at 20 C F R 718 201 c which provide that pneumoconiosis is recognized as a latent and progressive disease which may first become detectable only after the cessation of coal mine dust exposure are not impermissibly retroactive The court noted that both parties agreed that in rare cases pneumoconiosis is latent and progressive As a result the court found that the amended regulation simply prevents operators from claiming that pneumoconiosis is never latent and progressive the provisions at 20 C F R 725 309 d related to filing multiple claims are not improperly retroactive and the provisions at 20 C F R 725 101 a 6 wherein the definition of benefits includes expenses related to the Department sponsored medical examination and testing of the miner under 725 406 is not impermissibly retroactive Under the amended provisions as with the prior version of the regulations the Trust Fund is reimbursed by the employer for the costs of the Department sponsored examination in the event that the claimant is successful b Not affirmed The court did however remand the case for further proceedings regarding certain provisions which were impermissibly retroactive The court defined an impermissibly retroactive regulation as applied to pending claims where the new rule reflects a substantive change from the position taken by any of the Courts of Appeals and is likely to increase liability With this criteria in mind the court concluded that the following regulations are improperly retroactive the total disability rule at 20 C F R 718 204 a is impermissibly retroactive because the amendments provide that an independent disability unrelated to the miner s pulmonary or respiratory disability shall not be considered in determining whether a miner is totally disabled due to pneumoconiosis contrary to the Seventh Circuit s holding in Peabody Coal Co v Vigna 22 F 3d 1388 7th Cir 1994 holding that a non respiratory or non pulmonary disability such as a stroke will preclude entitlement to black lung benefits the provisions at 20 C F R 725 101 a 31 which provide that a payment funded wholly out of general revenues shall not be considered a payment under a workers compensation law are impermissibly retroactive The court cited to a contrary decision from the Third Circuit in Director OWCP v Eastern Associated Coal Corp 54 F 3d 141 3d Cir 1995 wherein the court declined to adopt the Director s policy of not reducing a miner s black lung benefits by any amount s he received from general revenues under a state occupational disease compensation act the medical treatment dispute provisions at 20 C F R 725 701 are impermissibly retroactive as they create a rebuttable presumption that medical treatment for a pulmonary disorder is related to coal dust exposure contrary to the Sixth Circuit s holding in Glen Coal Co v Seals 147 F 3d 502 6th Cir 1998 and the amended provisions at 20 C F R 725 204 725 212 b 725 213 c 725 214 d and 725 219 c and d are impermissibly retroactive because they expand the scope of coverage by making more dependents and survivors eligible for benefits 2 Arbitrary and capricious not found In addition to reviewing the regulatory amendments to determine whether they could be retroactively applied the court also analyzed substantive changes in the following regulations and determined that they were not arbitrary and capricious The definition of pneumoconiosis at 20 C F R 718 201 a to include legal and medical pneumoconiosis is proper as it merely adopts a distinction embraced by all six circuits to have considered the issue the provisions at 20 C F R 718 201 c which state that pneumoconiosis is recognized as a latent and progressive disease which may first become detectable only after cessation of coal mine dust exposure is not arbitrary and capricious given the government s narrow construction of the regulation during oral argument that pneumoconiosis may be latent and progressive as well as a study cited at 62 Fed Reg 3 338 3 344 Jan 22 1997 which supports a finding that pneumoconiosis is latent and progressive as much as 24 of the time the change in condition rule at 20 C F R 725 309 is not arbitrary and capricious because the burden of proof continues to rest with the claimant to demonstrate that one of the applicable conditions of entitlement has changed the treating physician rule at 20 C F R 718 104 d provides that a treating physician s opinion may be accorded controlling weight but the rule is not mandatory As a result the court concluded that it did not arbitrary and capricious nor does it improperly shift the burden of proof from the claimant to the employer the hastening death rule at 20 C F R 718 205 c 5 is not arbitrary and capricious because the regulation nowhere mandates the conclusion that pneumoconiosis be regarded as a hastening cause of death but only describes circumstances under which a hastening cause conclusion may be made the responsible operator designation provisions at 20 C F R 725 495 c are not arbitrary and capricious w here as here the Secretary affords a mine operator liable for a claimant s black lung disease the opportunity to shift liability to another party it is hardly irrational to require the operator to bear the burden of proving that the other party is in fact liable the medical treatment dispute regulation at 20 C F R 725 701 e is not arbitrary and capricious and the total disability rule at 20 C F R 718 204 is not arbitrary and capricious merely because it abrogates the Seventh Circuit s decision in Peabody Coal Co v Vigna 3 Burden of proof not improperly shifted The court also upheld the following regulations on grounds that they did not improperly shift the burden of proof the regulation at 20 C F R 725 408 which sets a deadline for an operator to submit evidence if it disagrees with its designation as the potentially liable operator does not improperly shift the burden of proof from the Director to the employer to identify the proper responsible operator rather the court found that the regulation shifts the burden of production not the burden of proof it requires nothing more than that operators must submit evidence rebutting an assertion of liability within a given period of time and the medical treatment dispute regulation at 20 C F R 725 701 e does not improperly shift the burden of proof to the employer to disprove medical coverage rather the Secretary explains that it shifts only the burden of production to operators to produce evidence that the treated disease was unrelated to the miner s pneumoconiosis the ultimate burden of proof remains on claimants at all times 4 Limitation of evidence upheld The court also upheld the evidence limitation rules on grounds that the Administrative Procedure Act at 5 U S C 556 d as well as the Black Lung Benefits Act permit the agency to exclude irrelevant immaterial or unduly repetitious evidence as a matter of policy Moreover the circuit court noted that the amended regulations afford ALJs the discretion to hear additional evidence for good cause See 20 C F R 725 456 b 1 The court also determined that the evidentiary limitations were not arbitrary and capricious 5 Cost shifting not upheld where claimant unsuccessful Finally the court found that the cost shifting regulation at 20 C F R 725 459 invalid on its face because it improperly permits ALJs in their discretion to shift costs incurred by a claimant s production of witnesses to an employer regardless of whether the claimant prevails The court noted that the Secretary is authorized to shift attorney s fees under 33 U S C 928 d only in the event that the claimant prevails Table

compliant physicians willing to give the miner an overly favorable diagnosis that cannot be supported by the weight of the medical evidence A miner who develops total disability due to pneumoconiosis three years after such a premature determination will find that the friendly doctor has done him no favor Indeed the chief danger with this rule even given the constraint of communication to the miner could be that u nscrupulous employers could conveniently avoid all liability by purposely making premature determinations Gov t Br at 37 n 12 We have no occasion in this case to address the risk
