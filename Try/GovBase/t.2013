Web White Sands Test Facilty Welcome to the NASA JSC White Sands Test Facility White Sands Test Facility WSTF is a preeminent resource for testing and evaluating potentially hazardous materials space flight components and rocket propulsion systems These services are available to NASA the Department of Defense other federal agencies universities and commercial industry Propulsion Default htm Rocket Propulsion The primary mission of WSTF is to support NASA s Space Shuttle and Space Station Programs We support these and other Government and commercial efforts As the official Johnson Space Center JSC Propulsion Systems Development Facility our rocket propulsion program is a leader in propulsion systems testing with unique test expertise in hypergolic propellant handling and training and is the Shuttle Fleet Leader for testing orbital maneuvering and reaction control subsystems Chem Default htm Chemical and Physical Properties of Materials Our engineers chemists and scientists in WSTF state of the art laboratories conduct testing of hazardous materials and propellants air quality aerospace hardware and ground support equipment and all materials used in space flight We routinely perform Standard Testing for ASTM and NASA as well as ignition and flammability testing We continually seek to better understand and improve materials components and systems and to ensure safety during manned space flights Hazard Default htm Hazards Assessment Hazards assessment is a large part of what we do for NASA the Department of Defense aerospace and other areas of industry Our laboratory facilities conduct hazardous fluid assessment hypervelocity tests and explosive hazard assessment The High Energy Blast Facility performs explosive testing with solid cryogenic hypergolic propellants and other high explosives oxygen default htm Oxygen Systems Oxygen compatibility is a critical issue in space aircraft medical and industrial applications At WSTF we investigate the effects of increased oxygen concentration on the ignition and burning of materials and components used in these applications Hazards analyses are performed on materials components and systems and failure analyses determine the cause of fires Training courses about design and operation of safe oxygen systems are provided by WSTF personnel under the auspices of ASTM FltHardware Default htm Space Flight Hardware The Propulsion Component Test Facility at WSTF is an Orbiter and International Space Station Depot Repair Facility We perform flight hardware assembly repair and acceptance testing for private aerospace manufacturers as well We refurbish hypergolic propellant components for the Space Shuttle handle advanced pyrovalve testing at two of our laboratory facilities and perform failure investigations WSSH Default htm Launch and Landing Support White Sands Space Harbor WSSH is the primary training area for Space Shuttle pilots flying practice approaches and landings in the shuttle training aircraft and T 38 aircraft Our runways navigational aids runway lighting and control facilities continuously stand ready as a backup Shuttle landing site Other Areas of Interest About Default htm About WSTF
