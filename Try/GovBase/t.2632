COMMUNITIES PROVIDE EARLY HIV AIDS CARE HHS Secretary Tommy G Thompson today announced 45 grants totaling 23 million to help communities provide outpatient and primary care services for low income medically underserved Americans who are living with HIV AIDS or are at risk for contracting the virus These grants help community based organizations reach out to those who may be HIV positive but don t know it and get them into care Secretary Thompson said Early and continuous care can help these individuals live longer more productive lives Today s awards are competitive continuation grants and new grants for existing service areas The grants help ensure that early HIV care is targeted to those communities that need it most particularly in rural and remote areas and inner cities In addition to counseling testing and referral and medical evaluation and clinical care the grants also support oral health care adherence counseling nutritional counseling outpatient mental health outpatient substance abuse and appropriate referral for specialty and subspecialty care HIV AIDS continues to grow among traditionally underserved and vulnerable groups and people of color women and youth in particular remain disproportionately affected by the epidemic said Elizabeth M Duke administrator of HHS Health Resources and Services Administration HRSA Today s grants provide services that many of
