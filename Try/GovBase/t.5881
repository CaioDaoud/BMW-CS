Networking continues to evolve The demand for a High Speed Network Infrastructure has been growing at an alarming rate Just a few short years ago 4 Mbps Million bits per second Token Ring and 10 Mbps Ethernet shared networks were the norm Now they can t keep up with the growing demands from end users End user applications and files are growing in size and number This is an introduction to networking terminology and network infrastructure For an introduction to Local Area Networks LANs please see whatislan html What is a LAN One of the early types of networking topologies was Token Ring Token Ring uses a token passing access method In token passing collisions between packets are prevented by assuring that only one station can transmit at any given time This is accomplished by passing a special packet called a token from one station to another in a ring topology To learn more about ring topologies please see whatislan html What is a LAN When a station gets the token it can transmit a packet which travels in one direction around the ring When the packet passes by the station it is addressed to it is copied The packet continues to travel around the ring until it returns to the sending station which removes it and sends the token on to the next station on the ring Another popular network technology is Fiber Distributed Data Interface FDDI FDDI provides data transport at 100Mbps Originally FDDI networks required fiber optic cable but today they can accommodate twisted pair cable as well Fiber optic cable is still preferred in many FDDI networks because it can be used over much greater distances than twisted pair cable FDDI uses a token passing access method and is usually configured in a ring topology FDDI is used primarily as a backbone a segment of network that links several individual LANs together in building or campus environments One of the most common types of networks is Ethernet Originally Ethernet cables were coaxial similar to cable TV wires but now twisted pair cables similar to telephone wires are more common Fiber optic cables are used for higher speeds and greater distances than copper wires are capable of providing One version of Ethernet called 10BASE T consists of twisted pair cables and can transmit data at 10Mbps 10 million bits per second Another version Fast Ethernet is 10 times faster than 10 Base T Two of the common types of Fast Ethernet are 100Base T and 100Base FX 100BASE T consists of twisted pair cabling similar to 10Base T except the cables have to be of a higher quality to transmit the data reliably and the distance limitation is 100 meters 100Base FX is Fast Ethernet that runs over fiber optic cabling The fiber optic cable extends the distance to 2 000 meters over Multi mode cable The newest version of Ethernet is called Gigabit Ethernet and it can transmit data at 1000Mbps Gigabit Ethernet can use either Category 5 twisted pair cable or fiber optic cable to transmit the signals Soon 10 Gigabit Ethernet will be available It will only use fiber optic cables 10 Gigabit Ethernet will primarily be used for backbone applications Ethernet can support both bus and star topologies To learn more about bus and star topologies please see whatislan html What is a LAN The most popular is the star topology which makes use of a central hub or switch through which all information is passed All stations on the network are connected to the hub or switch and can sense packets as they are sent across the wire Because each station can send a packet at any time collisions between packets do occur These are common and are corrected instantaneously Ethernet networks are replacing Token Ring and FDDI networks daily Ethernet with its speed simplicity and low cost has won the war of the LAN Many sites are migrating their legacy networks to Ethernet Hubs also referred to as repeaters or concentrators are a very important part of the networking process Hubs are wiring concentrators which make use of structured wiring to connect stations on a LAN They contain user ports into which each station s cable is connected Many hubs are called intelligent or manageable which means that each of the ports on the hub can be configured monitored enabled and disabled by a network operator from a hub management console There are three different types of hubs A stand alone hub is as the term implies a single unit with a fixed number of ports Stand alone hubs usually include some method of linking them to other stand alone hubs A stackable hub looks and acts like a stand alone hub except that several of them can be stacked together usually joined by short lengths of cable When they are linked together they can be managed as a single unit A modular hub consists of modules that each act like a stand alone hub but like the stackable hubs they can be managed as a single unit Modular hubs consist of a chassis and the modules that go into the chassis The chassis links the modules together with an internal backplane and handles the management of individual modules All of these hubs can be linked together to broaden the network In order to create an internetwork linking LANs together other more complex devices are used Bridge device that connects two or more networks and forwards packets among them Usually bridges operate at the physical network level For example an Ethernet bridge connects two physical Ethernet cables and forwards from one cable to the other exactly those packets that are not local Bridges differ from repeaters because bridges store and forward complete packets while repeaters forward electrical signals They differ from IP Gateways or IP Routers because they use physical addresses instead of IP addresses Routers use Network Layer Protocol Information within each packet to route it from one LAN to another This means that a router must be able to recognize all of the different Network Layer Protocols that may be used on the networks it is linking together Switches devices with multiple ports each of which can support an entire Ethernet FDDI or Token Ring segment With a different segment connected to each of the ports it can switch packets between them as needed In effect a switch acts like a very fast multi port bridge because packets are filtered based on the destination address A new network technology called Asynchronous Transfer Mode ATM is based on the switch concept Switches are starting to replace hubs and routers in many installations Switching technology is increasing the efficiency and speed of networks This technology is making current systems more powerful while at the same time facilitating the migration to faster networks Switching directs network traffic in a very efficient manner It sends information directly from the port of origin to only its destination port Switching increases network performance enhances flexibility and eases moves adds and changes Switching establishes a direct line of communication between two ports and maintains multiple simultaneous links between various ports It proficiently manages network traffic by reducing media sharing traffic is contained to the segment for which it is destined be it a server power user or workgroup There are many different types of Switches some common examples are Unmanaged switch These switches come in many port varieties Anywhere from 4 to 24 ports Unmanaged switches are inexpensive but lack features for management Comparable to an unmanaged hub except they have the speed of a switch Workgroup switch Similar to unmanaged switch except provide management of the unit Sometimes provide Gigabit ports to uplink to larger backbone switches Stackable switch Usually has a proprietary cable to interconnect them together It allows a stack of switches to only use one IP address for management Some use Gigabit links to interconnect them and to uplink them to backbone switches Chassis Switch Backbone Switch or Core Switch Usually support Layer 3 switching along with Layer 2 switching and many high level protocols The Chassis have blades similar to high end routers So you can mix and match different interfaces for connecting different types of networks together Layer 2 switches The Data Link Layer operate using physical network addresses Physical addresses also known as link layer hardware or MAC layer addresses identify individual devices Most hardware devices are permanently assigned this number during the manufacturing process Switches operating at Layer 2 are very fast because they re just sorting physical addresses but they usually aren t very smart that is they don t look at the data packet very closely to learn anything more about where it s headed Layer 3 switching The Network Layer and all of its related terms e g multilayer switching IP switching routing switches etc was introduced as the router killer Layer 3 switching attempts to reduce the performance bottlenecks associated with traditional routers Layer 3 switches use network or IP addresses that identify locations on the network They read network addresses more closely than Layer 2 switches they identify network locations as well as the physical device A location can be a LAN workstation a location in a computer s memory or even a different packet of data traveling through a network Switches operating at Layer 3 are smarter than Layer 2 devices and incorporate routing functions to actively calculate the best way to send a packet to its destination But although they re smarter they may not be as fast if their algorithms fabric and processor don t support high speeds Layer 4 The Transport Layer of the OSI Model coordinates communications between systems Layer 4 switches are capable of identifying which application protocols HTTP SMTP FTP and so forth are included with each packet and they use this information to hand off the packet to the appropriate higher layer software Layer 4 switches make packet forwarding decisions based not only on the MAC address and IP address but also on the application to which a packet belongs Because Layer 4 devices enable you to establish priorities for network traffic based on application you can assign a high priority to packets belonging to vital in house applications such as Smartstream with different forwarding rules for low priority packets such as generic HTTP based Internet traffic Layer 4 switches also provide an effective wire speed security shield for your network because any company or industry specific protocols can be confined to only authorized switched ports or users This security feature is often reinforced with traffic filtering and forwarding features Hubs vs Switches Traditional Ethernet LANs run at 10Mbps over a common bus type design Stations physically attach to this bus through a hub repeater or concentrator creating a broadcast domain Every station is capable of receiving all transmissions from all stations but only in a half duplex mode This means stations cannot send and receive data simultaneously Nodes on an Ethernet network transmit information following a simple rule they listen before speaking In an Ethernet environment only one node on the segment is allowed to transmit at any time due to the CSMA CD protocol Carrier Sense Multiple Access Collision Detection Though this manages packet collisions it increases transmission time in two ways First if two nodes begin speaking at the same time the information collides they both must stop transmission and try again later Second once a packet is sent from a node and Ethernet LAN will not transfer any other information until that packet reaches its endpoint This is what slows up networks Countless hours have been lost waiting for a LAN to free up When a single LAN station is connected to a switched port it may operate in full duplex mode Full duplex does not require collision detection there is a suspension of MAC protocols A single device resides on that port and therefore no collisions will be encountered Full duplex switching enables traffic to be sent and received simultaneously Hubs between a workgroup and a switch will not run full duplex because the hub is governed by collision detection requirements The workgroup connected to the hub is unswitched Ethernet The bottom line is a 24 port 100Mbps hub is only capable of sharing the full 100Mbps with all 24 ports which averages out to 4 16Mbps for each port While at the same time a 24 port 100Mbps Switch has 24 individual 100Mbps ports The switch is capable of 2400Mbps or 2 4 Gigabits per second Also a switch can operate in full duplex mode so it has a theoretical throughput of 4800Mbps or 4 8 Gbps Virtual LANs VLANs When something is virtual it appears to be real but it is not A virtual LAN or VLAN appears to be one large network It is actually a collection of multiple networks While these networks are physically connected logically they are separate The protocol of each can be different A switch can control and regulate traffic of a number of networks creating a virtual LAN but it cannot connect a user on one VLAN with a user on another A router is required for that kind of connection A switched virtual LAN is a broadcast domain connecting a group of LANs at wire speed Ethernet switches have evolved from creating VLANs based on port assignment They can now create VLANs based on MAC addressing and network addressing This enables VLANs to be divided into closed logical user groups called subnets determined by administrative controls An Ethernet VLAN can be established through software allowing a network administrator to group a number of switch ports into a high bandwidth low latency switched workgroup For network management identification purposes each virtual LAN gets a unique network number VLANs function on a bridge architecture switching and transmitting data by media access control MAC source and destination addresses Traffic between virtual LANs is filtered secured and managed by a router at the software level separate from the virtual LAN switching logic To learn more about the NCI Frederick network please see infrastructure html
