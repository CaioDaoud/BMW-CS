level What are the different sex offender levels update How often is this information updated Sex offenders have always lived in our communities However it wasn t until passage of the Community Protection Act of 1990 which mandates sex offender registration that law enforcement agencies routinely tracked where sex offenders were living The King County Sheriff s Office is releasing information on registered sex offenders in King County in accordance with the Community Protection Act of 1990 and related statutes This information is not intended to create alarm or panic Our intent is to inform our citizens and to enhance community safety and awareness These individuals have served the sentence imposed by the courts and in compliance with the Community Protection Act have advised the King County Sheriff s Office that they will be living in King County Please note that these individuals are not wanted by the police at this time In addition because there are no court ordered restrictions about their residences the King County Sheriff s Office has no legal authority to direct where a sex offender may or may not live Citizen abuse of this information to threaten intimidate or harass registered sex offenders will not be tolerated In fact such abuse could end law enforcement s ability to notify the public The King County Sheriff s Office believes the only person who wins if community notification ends is the sex offender since sex offenders gain their power through secrecy Check out the feature links below http access wa gov Link to Access Washington
