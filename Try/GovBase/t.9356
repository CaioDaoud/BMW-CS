bestlinks html Links About the UCSC Genome Bioinformatics Site This site contains working drafts for the human genome and the mouse genome The human genome is over 90 complete Approximately 85 of the sequence is in a highly accurate finished state The other 15 is merely draft quality Some care must be taken when interpreting draft regions but these are still very useful to the working scientist The mouse genome is largely the result of a full genome shotgun assembly While there are many gaps in the sequence the order and orientation of the contigs on either side of a gap are known in almost all cases We estimate that 90 96 of the mouse genome is present in the assembly We encourage you to explore the working drafts with the genome browser which displays the work of many annotators worldwide The Genome Browser and the data it displays are freely available for academic nonprofit and personal use with a few exceptions Check the README txt file in the download directory of a particular assembly to view the use restrictions specific to that release Interactive use is limited to a maximum of 10 000 hits day or 10 hits minute News goldenPath newsarch html Aug 6 2002 We have fixed an error with six of the chr3 contigs in the bigZips contigAgp zip file The following agp files were corrected NT 005684 agp NT 005663 agp NT 022554 agp NT 022459 agp NT 006031 agp and NT 022419 agp The chr3 agp file in bigZips chromAgp zip was also modified This change does not affect the gl files the fa files the lift files or the annotations Alignments made on the previous version of chr3 are still good Updated versions of the contigAgp zip and chromAgp zip files were uploaded to our site today You can download the new versions via ftp at ftp genome cse ucsc edu goldenPath 28jun2002 ftp genome cse ucsc edu goldenPath 28jun2002 or via the Downloads link in the left sidebar Aug 2 2002 The problems with the June 2002 Build 30 hg12 RepeatMasker track have been resolved The new RepeatMasker track along with regenerated Fish Blat and Genscan tracks are now available in the Browser and through our Downloads link We ve also added a few new annotation tracks for the June 2002 release and will be adding more over the next 2 weeks The latest Genome Browser has 2 new features We ve added filter functionality to the Table Browser accessible via the Filter Fields button on the Table Browser main page Also some of the Dec 2001 human genome tracks eg RefSeq Genes now have a Comparative Sequence link from the details page that shows annotated codons and translated protein with alignment to the mouse genome July 26 2002 Bulk downloads of the June 2002 Build 30 human genome assembly hg12 are now available from ftp genome cse ucsc edu goldenPath 28jun2002 ftp genome cse ucsc edu goldenPath 28jun2002 You can also access the data via the Downloads link in the left sidebar This initial release of the annotation database download contains a limited set of tables Additional files will be available for download next week July 24 2002 The BLAT server and the coordinates conversion feature for human genome assembly Build 30 hg12 are now functional July 23 2002 We re pleased to announce the pre release of a browser for human genome assembly Build 30 from NCBI UCSC version hg12 This assembly was produced at NCBI based on sequence information submitted into GenBank as of June 28 2002 Build 30 release notes and statistics will soon be available from the http www ncbi nlm nih gov genome guide human NCBI web site Build 30 is an excellent high quality assembly It contains nearly 87 finished sequence and 94 97 coverage The sequence coverage of this build is much higher than in previous releases and there is a high level of correspondence between the sequence and the map Currently the human genome project appears to be on track to achieve the goal of finishing at least 95 of the human genome using Bermuda standards by April 2003 UCSC has generated a set of high level comparisons of the Build 30 draft sequence against various types of information STS maps BAC end pairs and clone overlaps accessible from the http hgwdev cse ucsc edu goldenPath chromReports 24Jun2002

available but should be accessible from this site later this week Data for the mitochondrial genome and several more annotation tracks will be posted for this release as they become available Bulk
