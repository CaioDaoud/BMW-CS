Natural Hazards The Earth is a living system that continuously reshapes itself through climatolgical and geological changes Powerful events including hurricanes and other great storms tornadoes floods volcanoes earthquakes landslides and droughts can be beneficial in bringing much needed rainfall altering the land and bringing about evolutionary changes to organisms over time But particularly as the human population encroaches into regions of high risk for the occurence of a natural hazard event the end result of a great storm or geological phenomenon can be massive damage to both property and life A diverse group of NOAA researchers collect archive and anyalyze natural hazard data in collaboration with many other Federal state and local agencies and organizations By careful examination and analyses of both historical and real time data scientists can aid in the hurricane satellite image hurricane satellite image protection of property and in reducing the accompanying injuries trauma and deaths that occur as a result of a natural hazard event Rigorous monitoring and studying of geological and meteorological conditions in the U S and worldwide has enabled the United States to develop some of the best predictive capabilities in the world This helps prevent catastrophic loss of life and aids the efforts of those agencies which deal directly with an ongoing crisis both domestically and internationally The National Oceanographic Data Center holds global physical chemical and biological oceanographic data sets that can be utilized by researchers and hazard management agencies which research and track extreme natural events The BUOY buoy html NOAA Marine Environmental Buoy Database holds wind wave and other marine data collected by the NOAA National Data Buoy
