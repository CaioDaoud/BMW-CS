stakeholders is expected to improve in 2003 Net farm income a measure of the sector s profitability is forecast to be up 20 billion 58 percent from the 35 3 billion earned in 2002 and 18 percent above the 10 year average Weather through July was favorable for crop production with the corn harvest projected to total a near record 10 billion bushels Prices available to farmers have been rising as a result of strong domestic and foreign demand Government payments to farmers are up substantially With continued appreciation in farmland prices supported by demand for nonfarm purposes the balance sheet for the farm sector continues to strengthen Go to Data FarmIncome Finfidmu htm Farm Income Forecast 1998 2003F Data The sector s value of production is now forecast to be up 22 3 billion 10 percent in 2003 Farmers will realize both greater production and higher commodity prices when they do choose to market their products Crops livestock and the service forestry sectors of the agricultural economy will all contribute to the sectorwide increase in value of production with crops up by 11 billion and livestock by more than 10 billion over 2002 Government payments are projected to be up 8 7 billion in 2003 see Data FarmIncome Finfidmu htm state income estimates The farm sector is forecast to contribute 100 billion to the U S economy in net value added a level exceeding the previous record of 97 7 billion contributed in 1996 Of that total 44 3 billion is projected to be earned by the stakeholders laborers landlords and lenders who contribute resources for a predetermined payment thereby avoiding the risks inherent in production and marketing The residual net farm income of 55 8 billion will accrue to those farm operators and contractors who contribute resources with the expectation of receiving financial rewards for sharing in the risks of production Over the last 10 years hired labor has averaged 18 percent of net value added followed by lenders at 15 percent and landlords at 12 percent In 2003 labor is expected to earn about 20 percent and the other two a little less than their 10 year average About 20 percent of net farm income is expected to accrue to contractors with the proprietors partners and corporate stockholders who operate farms earning the balance The mix of stakeholders varies by type of farm and region One would expect hired labor to be more prominent in areas growing specialty commodities like fruits and vegetables Contractors would be more important to hog poultry tobacco and vegetable farming operations and in areas producing those commodities Farms that are operated through various business arrangements such as informal partnering among family members and alternative legal structures are located throughout the country and in all types of commodity production Relative to the previous 2003 forecast in September the forecast for gross farm income is up 2 9 billion 1 1 percent and production expenses are essentially unchanged Consequently the forecasted rise in revenue and decline in expenses combine to raise the expectations for net farm income by 3 2 billion 6 percent As the residual income accruing to operators and investors the change in net farm income is the sum of the change in these two much larger components Net farm income is equivalent to about 20 percent of gross farm income and 25 percent of production expenses so the percent change in net farm income as a consequence of a change in either component is greater by a multiple of up to 5 Gallery NFIrevisions htm Effects of income account revisions on net farm income from June forecast The sector s improved financial picture will be shared broadly among U S farmers and ranchers and other stakeholders engaged in farm production The all time high for value of production in 2003 supplemented by government payments easily outpaces an increase in production costs However the distribution of the income changes will not be proportionate across all those who share in the sector s earnings Income and value added will differ among farm households farms and major regions of farm production The value of production of major field crops is expected to be up in 2003 Higher prices recovery from drought and improved yields should bolster the value of crop production by 11 billion A portion of the new crop could be retained in inventory at the end of the year to replenish the drawdown that occurred over the last 2 years If inventory replenishment occurs cash receipts for crops will increase by less than the value of production but the potential for sales is there if economic or personal financial conditions warrant Moreover the increase in crop receipts will extend across all segments of crop production except tobacco which has been in decline recently Price increases in the livestock sector are expected to offset slight drops in production The value of livestock production this year will not reach 2001 s record level but will exceed the average of the last 10 years by nearly 9 billion and will be the second largest value on record The improvement in receipts will be shared across all segments of the livestock industry Government payments are expected to show a large increase over last year Much of the growth is a result of the shift of 2002 direct payments into calendar year 2003 due to farmers signing up for payments in 2003 rather than 2002 This year s forecast of 19 7 billion is being driven by large increases in direct counter cyclical and ad hoc emergency payments associated with legislation enacted in the past 2 years Expenses for inputs purchased from other sectors of the economy are expected to rise by about 6 percent from 2002 to 2003 the largest increase since 1997 Fertilizers hired labor and fuels are expected to lead the rise in input costs The incomes of farm households are also expected to show an increase of about 3 100 per household or 4 8 percent over the amount earned in 2002 An increase in both the off farm and farm components of household earnings are expected to contribute to the rise in income Income from off farm sources continues to become more important to farm households data sources The current income update is based on USDA s most recent October supply and demand estimates for 2003 These estimates in turn are based on survey data of crop progress in late July and early August and give a good indication of what can be expected from this year s harvest The value of crop and livestock production are both up 11 percent over 2002 This forecast has the value of crop production remaining little changed from the September forecast but the value of livestock production up 3 billion from the September forecast This update also incorporates information from the latest Agricultural Resource Management Survey ARMS conducted annually by USDA s National Agricultural Statistics Service NASS and the Economic Research Service ERS ARMS provides USDA with observed annual data on expenses that farmers and ranchers incur in running their businesses and in managing their households ARMS is the only source of data reported by farmers that enable USDA to replace model based forecasts with observed data that reflect farmers actions and reported results see ARMS Agricultural Resource Management Survey ARMS With rapid changes such as those that have occurred in energy and land rental markets having observed data is important to USDA s ability to reflect current earning conditions In a companion effort for the farm ARMS reports current wage salary and other earnings for farm households Given rapid changes in nonfarm sectors of the economy with regard to employment and earnings ARMS provides USDA with an up to date fact check on the total incomes of farm families from all sources and enables USDA to monitor the ability of these families to repay debt and support basic household needs The ability to repay debt and cover basic household expenditures provides USDA with indicators of potential stress for farm businesses and for farm families see wealth htm assets debt and wealth and forenew htm farm household income farmers benefit from improving market conditions The dynamics of weather and market forces are now expected to raise the farm sector s value of production by 22 3 billion in 2003 with crop production contributing 11 billion supplemented by an additional 10 billion gain in livestock production The remainder derives from services and forestry Production has been strong across the board with little adverse effect on market prices The hot dry weather in Europe has lowered their agricultural production and thereby reduced the competition for U S exports The decline in the dollar relative to the Euro has also improved the competitive position of U S exports crop receipts up over 6 billion Receipts for all major crops are forecast up in 2003 with the exception of corn and tobacco Most will be at their highest levels in the past 5 years Food grains oilseeds and cotton could show double digit rises this year Corn the number one crop in receipts is expected to be down slightly about 1 percent Rising receipts in 2003 for field crops can be explained by the cooler and wetter than normal spring in most grain producing States These growing conditions could result in higher yields and production For example winter wheat is forecast at 46 7 bushels per acre 8 bushels more than a year ago and spring wheat at 40 bushels up 10 bushels with the quality of both classes expected to be good The forecast is for the average corn yield to rise from 2002 by 4 bushels per acre to 142 Soybeans are an exception Soybean yields are expected to be off in 2003 by 6 bushels to 34 bushels per acre because of the hot dry summer lowers the number of pods per plant and the pod size and an infestation of soybean aphids removes sap from plants The Iowa soybean crop could underperform by 90 million bushels while crops in Minnesota and Missouri could have shortfalls individually of about 30 million bushels U S wheat exports could get a big boost this year with Ukraine suffering a substantial winter kill early melt followed by a refreezing into an ice crust and suffocating the winter wheat and Russia a limited winter kill Cold weather in the winter and spring followed by summer dryness has taken its toll on wheat production in Eastern Europe Germany and France Australia and Canada endured severe drought in 2002 which lowered their wheat yields and reduced their harvested acreage but production is expected to rebound in both countries and compete with U S exports for the markets normally supplied by the European producers As these events unfold domestic wheat prices could fall by 6 percent from 2002 levels to 3 34 per bushel Even though exports of corn could strengthen slightly in 2003 corn used domestically for ethanol is expected to expand over 30 percent Firms are taking advantage of State ethanol production incentives to use more of existing capacity and to bring new plants on line With the record yield hanging over this market corn prices are expected to slip to around 2 10 per bushel or by 9 percent With lower soybean yields prices are expected to rise substantially around 20 percent during the 4th quarter and push cash receipts for soybeans upwards in 2003 to 16 2 billion 2 8 billion more than in 2002 The decline in U S world soybean supplies will cause world prices to rise also As a result South American producers are expected to sell off their stocks and businesses that crush soybean into meal and oil will sell their stocks on the export market livestock receipts up from last year Cattle will be a major contributor to the increased receipts expected in the livestock sector with cattle receipts anticipated to rise over 14 percent from 2002 Leading forces are the reduction in beef imports primarily from Canada with the cattle ban since May 20 Relaxed rules allow cattle under 30 months of age to enter the United States sharply lower fed cattle slaughter weights from last year due to poor feeding conditions since late February more cattle being brought to market earlier than normal to boost production and larger than normal female slaughter Pork production is expected to rise slightly in 2003 due to slightly higher dressed weights Japan increased its imports of U S pork by nearly 9 percent in the first half of 2003 Even with Canadian exports up sharply since June U S hog prices and receipts are expected to climb over 13 percent in 2003 Dairy receipts could improve in the last half of 2003 with prices showing an upward trend Milk prices in 2002 were low relative to 2001 by about 3 per hundredweight and have weakened more in the first half of 2003 by about another dollar Factors holding prices down have been rising production due to milk herd expansion caused by good returns during the previous 5 years continued weakening of demand for dairy products and burdensome stocks With American and Russian officials resolving issues on veterinary standards U S broiler exports are expected to strengthen with receipts expected to rise by better than 14 percent in 2003 After reaching a record in 2001 livestock receipts fell by 12 9 billion 12 percent in 2002 but are expected to recover almost all of that loss this year The sector could see sales rise to about 104 billion in 2003 up 11 billion over last year and 10 billion above the 10 year average government payments forecast at 19 7 billion Government payment terms ERS has used the term direct government payments to represent payments made directly to farmers and ranchers Other government policies provide indirect benefits to farmers For example the government purchases and stores dairy products increasing the demand for milk which raises the market price for milk With the Farm Security and Rural Investment Act of 2002 a new category of direct payment was introduced that is referred to as fixed direct payments This is not to be confused with the more general term of direct payments which actually refers to the total payments made directly to producers from all sources Direct government payments are expected to total 19 7 billion in 2003 up from 2002 s new estimate of 11 0 billion Total direct government payments in 2003 are expected to be nearly the same as those realized by farmers from 1999 through 2001 Farmers will receive much of the 2002 crop fixed direct and counter cyclical payments in calendar year 2003 Loan deficiency payments are expected to change little from 2002 This follows a 77 percent decline in 2002 because of lower production and higher prices for program eligible crops In the Data GP T7 htm government payment table the categories of conservation emergency assistance and miscellaneous government programs have been redefined to reduce the confusion about the classification of specific programs and to address other issues Conservation which previously included only the Conservation Reserve Program Agricultural Conservation Program Emergency Conservation Program and Great Plains Program now includes all conservation programs Ad hoc and emergency includes all programs providing disaster and emergency assistance to farmers In prior forecasts emergency assistance included only emergency assistance payments attributed to supplemental legislation The redefinition of the two categories reduces the number of programs that remain under the category of miscellaneous Within these categories the forecast of disaster and emergency payments for 2003 was raised to reflect the expectation that all these payments will be received this year Also the increase in the forecast of conservation program payments for 2003 is attributed to an increase in the number of programs and payments out of the Natural Resources Conservation Service total farm production expenses to rise in 2003 The forecast of 2003 total Data pe t4 htm production expenses including operator dwellings is 10 6 billion 5 5 percent above 2002 the largest absolute increase since 1979 The drop in farm production expenses estimated for 2002 was the first since 1999 and the largest percentage drop since 1986 Production expense estimates are based on ARMS results and are the results of the Agricultural Statistics Board deliberations reported in http usda mannlib cornell edu reports nassr price zpe bb NASS Farm Production Expenditures A comparison of expense estimates incorporated in the ERS income accounts and estimates included in NASS Farm Production Expenditures is available see Data FarmIncome val add ERSVERSUSNASS2002 xls table Feed purchased livestock fertilizers interest and hired labor make up the largest expense components For 2003 there is a forecast rise of between 3 and 6 percent across the whole range of expenses The largest increase is a 20 percent rise in fuel and oil expenses due primarily to a 24 percent increase in composite foreign and national prices for petroleum Double digit increases are also projected for fertilizer due to higher prices marketing storage and transportation due to a rise in general input prices and the anticipated 8 percent increase in crop output and net rent to nonoperators due to the increase in crop output and government payments The only expense that will likely fall in 2003 will be non real estate interest as the result of a decrease in interest rates crop related expenses The principal crop related expenses seeds fertilizer and pesticides are forecast to be 28 billion in 2003 7 percent above the 2002 estimate Fertilizer expenses are forecast to jump 13 percent in 2003 following an 8 percent drop in 2002 The price for natural gas the primary ingredient in nitrogen fertilizers is rising although not as rapidly as in late 2001 and early 2002 The price of natural gas is predicted to rise 25 percent overall in 2003 In the fourth quarter of 2002 and the first quarter of 2003 gas prices were 44 percent and 137 percent higher than in the previous year Consequently fertilizer prices rose through April 2003 and remain above 2002 prices Seed expenses are expected to rise around 7 percent Prices paid for seed in 2003 are forecast up 8 percent a continuation of the significant increases in 2000 and 2001 One factor in the rise of seed expenses has been the greater use of genetically modified seeds in corn soybeans and cotton which increases the necessity of purchasing seed rather than providing one s own seed from the previous harvest The slight rise in forecast pesticide expenditures is due to an increase in prices paid for pesticides more than offsetting lower expected quantities from fewer planted acres and preliminary indications that application rates may be reduced Corn uses about 60 percent of herbicides applied With corn acreage nearly the same in 2003 as in 2002 herbicide use will likely be flat The increase in cotton acreage which accounts for around 69 percent of insecticides contributes to an increase in insecticide use The decrease in potato acreage which uses about 80 percent of fungicides and other pesticides is the major factor in the reduced use of these pesticides livestock related expenses Feed expenses are forecast to rise nearly 3 percent in 2003 Feed prices were up in the first half of 2003 but larger crop production in 2003 will likely put downward pressure on prices in the latter part of the year The calendar year simple average price for corn which constitutes around 90 percent of the grain used for feed will be higher than in 2002 The price for soybean meal will also be higher while the price of hay is forecast to be down On the quantity side livestock production is forecast up slightly with a slight increase in poultry and egg production being nearly offset by a decrease in red meat animals Purchased livestock and poultry expenses are forecast up 2 billion 14 percent Since cattle and calves comprise nearly 80 percent of livestock and poultry purchases the situation in the beef business drives this expense Improved forage conditions in some areas the fall in the price of hay and the diminished cattle inventory will finally contribute to cattle prices rising in 2003 A slight increase in broiler production and a 15 percent rise in farmgate value of production will increase these expenses With flat turkey and egg production and prices the demand and price for turkey pullets and egg type chickens will likewise be flat payments to stakeholders In value added accounting payments to stakeholders are the returns that nonoperators receive for the land labor and capital they contribute to the farm sector s net value added In traditional net farm income accounting these contributions are considered expenses Net rent to nonoperators i e the return to land is projected to rise 1 3 billion 14 percent in 2003 The 11 percent increase in the value of 2003 crop production and a 90 percent increase in government payments to landlords account for the rise over 2002 net rent Employee compensation also referred to as hired labor is now projected to rise 1 3 billion 7 percent in 2003 as the result of an increase in wage rates and increases in production on most types of farms In 2002 the greatest percentage of hired labor was on greenhouse and nursery operations Other types of farms with a high percentage of labor costs were vegetable and melon fruit and nut and dairy farms The projected increase in value of production for grains oilseeds and cotton also means more hired labor on these farms as well The projected increase in 2003 agricultural wage rates is slightly lower than expected in nonagricultural wage rates and is the first time since 1996 that farm wage rates have risen less than nonagricultural rates However it continues a trend of year over year increases of 4 percent or more that stretches back to 1997 The 1 2 percent increase in interest expenses in 2003 is the result of an increase in real estate interest and a drop in nonreal estate short term interest This contrasts with the 2001 and 2002 estimates in which both types of interest expense decreased End of year debt in both categories continues to rise The increase in 2003 real estate interest expense is the product of a increase in end of year debt only partially offset by a decline in interest rates The decrease in nonreal estate interest is due to a increase in end of year debt being more than offset by a fall in nonreal estate interest rates With the farm level data provided by the ARMS it is possible to allocate net value added and net income among the various stakeholders Of this year s 100 billion in net value added farm operators are expected to earn around 45 billion and contractors are expected to earn around 11 billion as their net incomes for contributing resources and assuming the major risk of production Financial lenders landlords and contractors will likely each receive 11 14 percent of total net value added from production agriculture Hired workers will receive another 20 22 percent and operators get the remainder about 45 percent Thus the earnings from agricultural production are widely distributed among many different persons and enterprises and have a broad impact across the agricultural and local economies new state and national estimates for 2002 ERS has just completed its 18 month process of going from a first forecast to an estimate of farm income for the 2002 calendar year that is based on farmer reported survey and administrative record data see box This also means that the 2003 forecasts are now based on 2002 data rather than on 2001 This 2002 estimate will only be revised in the future as new data become available such as data from the ongoing 2002 Census of Agriculture new survey data from farmers or ranchers or new data on payments for USDA agencies In the case of 2002 estimates the 1999 Agricultural Economics and Land Ownership Survey AELOS a follow on survey to the 1997 Census of Agriculture was used to update the basis for estimates of landlord components of income and to revise value added for 1988 2002 From Forecast to Estimate An 18 Month Timeline of Data and Procedures Jan 02 First forecast of 2002 ERS 2000 estimates as base year May 02 Second forecast of 2002 new

incorporated Nationally net farm income was 35 3 billion in 2002 down 30 3 percent from the previous year and 13 5 billion below the 10 year average of 48 8 billion for 1992 2001 The all time high occurred in 1996 when producers of major field crops livestock and service and forest producers all enjoyed sharp increases in output Net cash income was 49 1 billion in 2002 down 17 1 percent from 2001 Net farm income is a measure of income created within the year from production activities regardless of whether sold by December 31 Net cash income is cash income generated within the calendar year and potentially available to pay debt principal and family living expenses Go to Data FarmIncome Finfidmu htm Farm Income Forecast 1998 2003F Data 2002 government payments were down from 2001 Historical estimates of government payments are based on administrative data from FSA and NRCS The 2002 estimate of 10 961 5 million was obtained from the FSA s preliminary End of the Year Payments to Producers Report 2002 and NRCS provides additional payments to producers for programs falling under their umbrella of responsibility According to USDA s 2002 Agricultural Resource Management Survey ARMS 44 percent of all farms received government payments in 2002 This was up from 2001 when 41 percent of farms reported receiving payments Gross cash income of farms receiving government payments in 2002 averaged 120 739 nearly three times that of farms not receiving payments Only for very large family farms and nonfamily farms was the average gross cash income for farms receiving government payments less than the gross cash income for farms not receiving government payments Payments average 10 670 for those operations receiving payments contributing 9 percent of gross cash income to these farms see table Data DistributionGovernmentPayments wk1 Lotus Data DistributionGovernmentPayments XLS Excel Although less than one percent of government payments went to limited resource farms these payments provided 16 percent of those farms gross cash income Only 33 percent of residential lifestyle farms received any government payments As in past years the largest government payments went to very large family farms Nearly 65 percent of very large family farms received government payments However the average payment of 57 364 represented less than 6 percent of their gross cash income Looking at the composition of average government payments received by those farms receiving payments production flexibility contract payments contributed 26 percent of the total Gallery FarmsReceivingPayment htm see figure Direct program payments a program authorized by Farm Security and Rural Investment Act of 2002 to replace production flexibility contracts contributed 13 percent of the total The combined level of contribution from these two programs toward total payments was about the same level across farm typology except for retirement farms and residential lifestyle farms where the combined programs contributed less toward total payments Government payments for retirement and residential lifestyle farms were largely from conservation programs For retirement farms more than 50 percent of government payments were conservation payments Less than 7 percent of all farms received loan deficiency payments see table Data AverageGovernmentPayments wk1 Lotus Data AverageGovernmentPayments XLS Excel For these farms loan deficiency payments contributed 32 percent of government payments Government payments represented 11 percent of gross cash income These all represent significant reductions from what participating farms reported in ARMS 2001 In years of large loan deficiency payments incentives for eligible farmers to make use of commodity certificates increase as they approach the per person payment limitation of 75 000 total for marketing loan gains and loan deficiency payments As such there was reduced incentive for eligible farms to make use of commodity certificates in 2002 Less than one percent of all farm types including rice and cotton farms reported income from net value of commodity certificates However for farms that reported certificates net value of commodity certificates represented nearly 40 percent of government payments Government payments contributed about 21 percent of their gross cash income About 12 percent of all farms reported receiving conservation program Conservation Reserve Program Wetlands Reserve Program and Environmental Quality Incentive Program payments Average conservation payment received on participating farms was 5 446 representing 42 percent of their total government payments For these farms government payments contributed 12 percent of gross cash income Forty two percent of the farms receiving conservation payments were in the Heartland region These farms represent 25 percent of all farms in the Heartland The average conservation payment of 4 160 below the national average payment was 43 percent of total government payments Government payments were 10 percent of gross cash income Large and very large family farms reported the largest average conservation payments However the largest contribution that conservation program payments provided to farm income was realized by retirement farms Conservation programs provided 89 percent of total government payments to retirement farms Government payments were 41 percent of retirement farms gross cash income The Farm Security and Rural Investment Act of 2002 terminated marketing quota programs for peanuts and authorized compensation payments to peanut quota holders for loss of quota asset value Less than one percent of all farms reported receiving peanut quota compensation payments Average quota compensation payment received by these farms was 33 934 This payment was nearly half of the government payments received by these farms and government payments were 27 percent of gross cash income Only 28 percent of the farms reporting compensation payments were peanut farms over 50 percent of gross agricultural production from peanuts However about 60 percent of peanut farms reported receiving compensation payments in 2002 under the single payment option eligible quota holders may have chosen to receive their quota compensation payment another fiscal year The Act provides for the determination of peanut base acres and payment yields for acres that was planted to peanuts during any or all of 1998 through 2001 crop years Historic peanut producers become eligible for direct payments counter cyclical payments marketing assistance loans and loan deficiency payments Direct government payments have historically been associated with production of program commodities and therefore have not been evenly distributed across all U S regions and farm types Ninety six percent of cotton farms over 50 percent of gross agricultural production from cotton receive direct government payments These farms received the highest average payment 54 423 of any commodity specialization Although cotton farms represent only about one percent of all payments farms they receive 7 percent of all payments Eighty eight percent of the cash grains and soybean farms receive direct payments These farms about 30 percent of all payment farms receive 40 percent of all payments About 40 percent of beef farms receive payments With average payment level at 5 921 beef farms receive 16 percent of all government payment Eighty five percent of dairy farms receive government payments These farms received the highest average payment at 19 924 of the farms that specialized in livestock Farms in the Heartland Northern Great Plains and Prairie Gateway have traditionally been large producers of program crops and have received a large share of the government commodity program payments In 2002 these regions accounted for 39 percent of all farms but received 57 percent of direct government payments Nearly 80 percent of farms in the Northern Great Plains received payments Average payment to these farms was 15 238 Payment farms in the Mississippi Portal region received the highest average payment at 21 564 These farms about 4 percent of all payment farms received 9 percent of all payments A large share of cotton farms is located in the Mississippi Portal region Farms in the Eastern Uplands received the smallest payments These farms 9 percent of all payments farms received about 3 percent of all payments 2002 is the first year that ARMS asked operators about the amount of State and local program payments received by the farm Nearly 5 percent of all reporting farms received State and local program payments Average payment was 6 684 representing 41 percent of the total government payments received by these farms Twenty five percent of the farms in the Heartland region received State and local program payments Farms in the Fruitful Rim received the largest average payment However this payment was realized by less then 2 percent of Fruitful Rim farms aggregate farm income masked divergent trends among states in 2002 Economic conditions varied significantly across States Those States where livestock and specialty crops rank high in the commodity mix generally fared better than those relying on the major field crops Program payments generally go to the major field crops corn wheat cotton and soybeans and Government payments were down 47 percent in 2002 For more details see Data FarmIncome Finfidmu htm States net farm income Another factor was that production expenses declined 3 percent in 2002 Gallery nfave2003 htm Relationship of 2002 net farm income to 1992 2001 average Agriculture contributes about 1 percent to U S GDP This percentage has remained fairly constant At the State level however the contribution can vary dramatically For 2001 the last year for which the Department of Commerce has published State level gross sector product estimates the value added from agricultural production to total State product ranged from 0 06 percent in Massachusetts to 8 5 percent in South Dakota Gallery StatesGSP2001 htm Agriculture s contribution to States economies 2001 1 Two factors help determine the importance of agriculture the net value added of agriculture itself and the amount of product coming from other sectors of the State s economy For example in 2001 New York had value added from agriculture of 1 5 billion and North Dakota had value added from agriculture of 1 6 billion However New York agriculture made up only 0 2 percent of that State s product while North Dakota agriculture made up 8 2 percent The economy of New York is characterized by many nonagricultural industries North Dakota is primarily an agricultural state with much less output from nonagricultural subsectors Agriculture was less important as a component of States total value added in the Northeast from Virginia into New England The Great Plains and Delta ranked among the highest What this means for agriculture is that the economic performance of certain commodity industries can have a greater impact one State s economy than another s The States where agriculture ranks highest in the economy tend to be more heavily dependent on cattle and calves and on hogs Small grains are also important Livestock receipts in 2001 were at record levels and these contributed to the beef States rankings for more information contact mailto rogers ers usda gov Roger Strickland web administration mailto webadmin ers usda gov webadmin ers usda gov page updated November 13 2003
