Software of the Year award winner http www links2go com topic Air Traffic Control Key Resource logo Links2Go Air Traffic Control Dr Heinz Erzberger The Center TRACON Automation System or CTAS is a set of tools designed to help air traffic controllers manage the increasingly complex air traffic flows at large airports The tools in CTAS benefit air traffic controllers by reducing stress and workload and benefit air travelers by reducing delays and increasing safety CTAS is more than a set of tools By combining the skill of controllers with computer generated advisories the CTAS environment inaugurates a new approach to air traffic control referred to as human centered automation In human centered automation controllers increase both their effectiveness to manage complex traffic situations and their awareness of the evolving traffic situation while retaining their traditional responsibilities for control and safety CTAS was conceived and is being prototyped at the NASA Ames Research Center In 1991 it was chosen by the Federal Aviation Administration FAA as the future automation system for the terminal area In a unique design process scientists engineers and controllers combined their talents to create the algorithms software and human interfaces in CTAS fashioning them into tools that controllers can use effectively to solve complex traffic problems What are the fundamental technical innovations that make CTAS work First and foremost is a technique for computing and predicting aircraft trajectories with high accuracy in real time In CTAS this technique is embodied in a large and complex software algorithm referred to as the trajectory synthesizer Second is an algorithm for scheduling aircraft to land at runways with the least possible delay Third are methods for communicating between CTAS and controllers through special graphical interfaces These three innovations together with radar tracks and weather data are brought together in a complex real time software system that generates CTAS information The development of CTAS should not be confused with FAA s ongoing effort to replace the obsolete and failure prone infrastructure of the current air traffic control system While that effort is independent of the CTAS development the new infrastructure especially color display consoles for controllers will be highly beneficial for implementing advanced CTAS tools still in laboratory development CTAS is a work in progress NASA and FAA are installing prototype CTAS tools in several stages at air traffic control facilities serving the Denver and Dallas Fort Worth airports At these sites CTAS tools are being evaluated by controllers who are using them in the management of arrival traffic All three major tool sets in CTAS which are the Traffic Management Advisor TMA Descent Advisor DA and Final Approach Spacing Tool FAST have undergone initial field evaluation at these airports However much additional field testing as well as laboratory development must still be done before the full potential of CTAS is realized This CTAS Home Page will keep you informed with up to date information on news items progress reports and
