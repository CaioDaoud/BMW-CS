the San Francisco Bay Area specifies how some 87 billion 2001 dollars of anticipated federal state and local transportation funds will be spent in the nine county Bay Area during the next 25 years rtp View the 2001 RTP The Commission determined the plan was in conformity with federal air quality regulations in March 2002 In November 2002 a strategy to increase ridership was adopted as an amendment to the plan The 2001 RTP sets aside nearly 11 billion for major new rail and bus projects that will improve mobility and enhance connectivity for residents throughout the region This component of the plan is known as the rtep htm Regional Transit Expansion Program adopted as Resolution 3434 Included are a BART extension from Fremont to San Jose and Santa Clara a Central Subway that would extend the San Francisco Muni s Third Street light rail line to Chinatown a BART connector to the Oakland Airport electrification of the Caltrain route and extension of the line to downtown San Francisco a significant downpayment on BART extensions or other rail improvements to Livermore and Antioch the addition of several new regional express bus services the replacement of the Transbay Terminal in San Francisco and AC Transit rapid bus service linking Berkeley Oakland and San Leandro Resolution 3434 is the successor to MTC s Resolution 1876 which was adopted by the Commission in 1988 and delivered such critical projects as the BART extensions to Pittsburg Bay Point and Dublin Pleasanton the Tasman light rail extension in Silicon Valley and the BART extension to the San Francisco International Airport which is scheduled to open next year Among the other initiatives that will receive funding through the plan are a lifeline htm Lifeline Transportation Network that will enhance low income residents access to the region s transit systems during both peak commute periods and off peak hours a two year pilot program through which MTC will provide up to 1 73 million to subsidize bus passes for low income students in the region the TransLink universal fare card now being tested on several Bay Area transit systems the Freeway Service Patrol that assists motorists in distress on the region s freeways rideshare programs that set up carpool vanpool ride matches and the TravInfo traveler information service with a single regionwide phone number 817 1717 to provide up to the minute traffic information and connect to transit agencies The 2001 Regional Transportation Plan provides funding for dozens of congestion relief projects on Bay Area freeways as well These include a fourth bore for the Caldecott Tunnel widening U S 101 from the Novato Narrows in Marin County to Windsor in Sonoma County reconfiguring the Interstate 80 Interstate 680 Route 12 interchange in Fairfield adding a high occupancy vehicle HOV lane to Interstate 680 over the Sunol Grade and widening U S 101 from Metcalf Road in San Jose to Cochrane Road in Morgan Hill The plan also includes new bicycle and pedestrian trails around the Bay Area While focused on mobility investments the Regional Transportation Plan also triples funding for MTC land use oriented initiatives such as the Transportation for Livable Communities program and the Housing Incentive Program that promote transit and pedestrian oriented development These programs signify the plan s commitment to smart growth principles designed to address urban sprawl Of the total 87 4 billion in transportation revenues that MTC anticipates coming to the Bay Area during the next quarter century 77 percent 67 7 billion is devoted to maintaining and operating the region s existing road highway and transit network The remaining 23 19 7 billion provides for new projects or system expansion Roughly 77 percent of the total funding outlined in the plan will go to public transit for operations rehabilitation and expansion The Regional Transportation Plan also includes a Blueprint section that envisions what could be accomplished if more money becomes available One new source of funding is Proposition 42 approved by voters on the statewide ballot in March 2002 The state constitutional amendment permanently dedicates 100 percent of the existing state sales tax on gasoline for transportation investments 2001 REGIONAL TRANSPORTATION PLAN Download in Acrobat PDF format Entire downloads final RTP 2001 all pdf 2001 RTP 13 7 MB downloads
