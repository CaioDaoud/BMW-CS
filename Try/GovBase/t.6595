energy and matter at a fundamental level by investigating the elementary particles and the forces between them This program is the major sponsor of high energy physics research in the US providing 90 of the Federal support Until the Large Hadron Collider in Europe is completed in 2007 the US will be the primary center of international activity for experimental research in the field of high energy physics There is the potential for exciting new discoveries and the program is positioning itself to take advantage of these opportunities The mission of the Nuclear Physics NP program is to advance our knowledge of the properties and interactions of atomic nuclei and nuclear matter and the fundamental forces and particles of nature The NP program provides about 85 of the Federal support for nuclear physics research With this funding the program seeks to understand how quarks bind together to form nucleons and nuclei to create and study the quark gluon plasma that is thought to have been the primordial state of the early universe and to understand energy production and element synthesis in stars and stellar explosions Sub Organization program offices HEPflier pdf HEP Program
