FNAL Workshop on Structure Formation and Dark Matter Halos Workshop on Structure Formation and Dark Matter Halos Fermilab 10 12 May 2001 The meeting will focus on how recently or soon to be released data sets can best be used to constrain models of hierarchical clustering Galaxy surveys Observations and models clustering as a function of colour morphological type evolution of clustering as a function of colour type redshift space distortions halo models Cluster surveys optical X ray Sunyaev Zeldovich Gravitational lensing surveys strong weak galaxy galaxy quasar galaxy shear and magnification bias In direct dark matter searches Problems cuspy cores and halo substructure Local organizing committee Scott Dodelson Josh Frieman Wayne Hu Roman Scoccimarro Ravi Sheth Schedule of talks All talks will be in the room called Curia II in the building called Wilson Hall which is the high rise structure on the Fermilab site The schedule of talks is available talks html here A list of people who have registered is available ehc01 part pdf here Registration Please register using this http cpaq55668 fnal gov ehc01 registration htm registration form There is no registration fee and there will be no proceedings published General information and accomodation General information about Fermilab travel between Chicago s O Hare airport and Fermilab and hotels in the area is available http www fnal gov pub visiting index html here Rooms at Red Roof Inn or at Extended Stay America should get a discounted rate if you mention Fermilab when making your reservation A http www ppd fnal gov conferences conf HotelMap pdf hotel map is available here We will not be organizing any special transportation between Fermilab and the hotels Last modified Fri May 4 11 06 13 CDT 2001 mailto sheth fnal gov sheth fnal gov
