Science Division at NASA Glenn Research Center is responsible for planning advocating directing and implementing space experiments in technology and microgravity science This Division both conducts and sponsors ground based scientific and technology studies that may lead to experiments in space The focus of these efforts is to enhance the understanding of the role of gravity in a wide range of physical processes ie materials science power propulsion combustion fluid physics plasma physics etc This work is carried out by scientists in the external community and by scientists in this Division as well as in other Center organizations The technology experiments for which the Division is responsible provide enabling technology for future space missions including the Space Station and the planned programs in Human Exploration and Development of Space Enterprise A very significant and substantial part of the Division s effort is the design buildup testing and integration of hardware for experiment packages to be launched aboard the Space Shuttle This division is also responsible for planning the utilization of the Space Station for scientific and technological missions This includes defining experimental facilities and developing experimental hardware for the Space Station This table is used for layout only Station Time in Orbit This table is used for layout only MSD Hardware in
