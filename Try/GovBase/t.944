Why is Hispanic separated from the race catergories In general the Census Bureau defines ethnicity or origin as the heritage nationality group lineage or country of birth of the person or the person s parents or ancestors before their arrival in the United States People who identify their origin as Spanish Hispanic or Latino may be of any race The federal Office of Management and Budget s OMB standards for data on race generally reflect social definition recognized in this country and do not conform to any biological anthropological or genetic criteria According to the revised OMB standards race is considered a separate concept from Hispanic origin ethnicity and wherever possible separate questions should be asked on each concept How do I compare race data now that the categories have changed In 1997 the Office of Management and Budget OMB revised the Standards for the Classification of Federal Data on Race and Ethnicity to include Pacific Islanders as a separate category as well as allow respondents to mark more than one race Since the new standards were used in Census 2000 the race categories are no longer comparable with data from previous years The
