Cytoskeleton Research Lab Research in the lab focuses on how actin binding proteins affect the architecture of the actin cytoskeleton in various mammalian tissues during exposure to altered gravity conditions Another project in collaboration with Stuart Kim of Stanford University involves evaluation of responses in the nematode C elegans upon exposure to mechanical stimulation including altered gravity conditions such as hypergravity simulated by centrifugation and microgravity during spaceflight Principal Investigator mailto cconley mail arc nasa gov Dr Catharine A Conley 20 G centrifuge Research Facilities http lifesci arc nasa gov CGBR CGBR html Center for Gravitational Biology Research Ground Based Facility The Center for Gravitational Biology Research facilities are operated by the Life Sciences Division Facility Utilization Office FUO Each facility is under the direction of a Principal Investigator Science Director supported by a team of dedicated engineers and laboratory technicians The FUO staff is available to assist visiting investigators with experiment planning and implementation These NASA facilities are a National Resource available to qualified researchers throughout the world The FUO encourages investigators to send detailed proposals explaining how they would exploit the unique capabilities of the hardware Diagram of Centrifuge Accomodation Module http brp arc nasa gov Space Station Biological Research Project Space Flight Facility Features of the Space Station Facilities will include multiple habitats to support a variety of organisms a centrifuge with a selectable rotation rate to house specimen habitats at a variety of gravity levels a holding rack to house specimens at microgravity and a fully equipped workstation glovebox The laboratory will also provide microscopes freezers and other research equipment to conduct experimental procedures To request information on this web site in a Section 508 accessable format please
