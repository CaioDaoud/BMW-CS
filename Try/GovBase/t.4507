Center Data Services Branch EDC has stored processed and distributed a variety of data including cartographic data satellite data and aircraft data The EDC houses a variety of USGS digital cartographic data products collectively referred to as US GeoData The EDC s archives also hold the world s largest collection of civilian remotely sensed data covering the Earth s land masses housing millions of satellite images and aerial photographs As part of its role as a data archive the EDC operates the National Satellite Land Remote Sensing Data Archive a legislatively mandated program designed to maintain a high quality data base of space acquired images of the Earth for use in studying global change and other related issues Link to USGS Homepage http www usgs gov Geography http

value The artists of this collection come from three sensors aboard satellites orbiting the Earth Landsat 7 ASTER and MODIS Products available include a Light Jet print and digital media For further

Research Carbon plays a fundamental role in regulating the climate of the Earth system Yet much about how carbon cycles through the environment particularly the terrestrial environment remains poorly quantified The USGS EROS Data Center EDC is applying its expertise in satellite remote sensing biogeochemical modeling analysis of large spatial data sets and geographic information systems applications to develop a quantitative understanding of the terrestrial carbon cycle This understanding will be the basis for tools to help policy makers and resource managers evaluate the carbon consequences of land management options including implications for climate change mitigation strategies The research is focused on the United States Central Asia and the Sahel For more information

Landsat Mosaics Education CD ROM US Digital Landsat Mosaics Educational CD ROM A new CD ROM set of satellite images provides a valuable record of land surface conditions in the U S in the early 1990 s Over 500 Landsat 4 and Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper scenes were mosaicked to create the views of the United States Scenes were selected from collections covering nearly a three year period in order to get quality cloud free coverage The mosaicking process was done by Earth Satellite Corporation under agreement with the USGS and NASA For more information or to order please visit http edcdaac usgs
