Electric Power Monthly Executive Summary The Electric Power Monthly EPM presents monthly electricity statistics provides monthly statistics at the State Census division and U S levels for net generation fossil fuel consumption and stocks quantity and quality of fossil fuels cost of fossil fuels electricity retail sales associated revenue and average revenue per kilowatthour of electricity sold In addition data on net generation fuel consumption fuel stocks quantity and cost of fossil fuels are also displayed for the North American Electric Reliability Council NERC regions energy

Generation and Consumption of Fuels Total generation of electric power in August 2003 increased by 2 percent compared to August 2002 Coal fired plants provided the bulk of the increase generating 4 percent more power than in August 2002 Generation from petroleum and hydroelectric plants was also higher than in August 2002 increasing by 34 and 11 percent respectively During August 2003 64 percent of electric power generation was produced at utility power plants 32 percent by independent power producers and the remainder at industrial and commercial combined heat and power plants Utility operated power plants consumed 77 percent of the coal for electric power generation in August 2003 compared to 21 percent by independent power producers While utilities accounted for the largest share of coal consumption the reverse was true for natural gas with independent power producers consuming 55 percent of the gas compared to 36 percent by utilities The balance of coal and gas consumption is attributable to combined heat and power plants For year to date 2003 compared to 2002 total net generation showed little change increase of 0 4 percent Year to date nuclear generation is down 2 percent and natural gas generation is down 8 percent The slack has been taken up by coal generation a 3 percent increase petroleum fired generation a 40 percent jump and hydroelectric power a 3 percent increase The large increase in petroleum fired generation is likely a result of the high price of natural gas throughout 2003 see price discussion immediately below High gas prices drive plant operators to run oil fired units in place of gas fired generation and to switch plants that can burn either fuel from gas to oil Fuel Costs and Receipts July 2003 Relatively mild early summer weather across much of the country depressed electric power demand for natural gas in June and July 2003 The modest cooling season demand for gas allowed storage operators to inject large volumes of gas into underground storage facilities By the end of July working gas in storage was estimated to have been only about 9 percent below the previous 5 year average for July much improved from earlier months The improved storage situation contributed to a decline in market prices for natural gas Cash prices at the Henry Hub which had consistently been above 5 per million Btu on a monthly basis since the beginning of the year fell below 4 70 per million Btu during the last week in July Only two months earlier the Henry Hub price topped 6 per million Btu In contrast to the decline in natural gas prices crude oil prices in July 2003 were static Average prices for July were little changed from June averages In July the West Texas Intermediate WTI spot average price was 30 75 per barrel compared to 30 66 in June Consistent with the trends noted above the average price paid for natural gas by electric generators in July 2003 of 5 33 per MMBtu was lower than the price of 5 81 in June 2003 The average price paid for fuel oil was almost unchanged averaging 4 28 per MMBtu in July 2003 compared to 4 27 per MMBtu in June 2003 f1 1 Both of these prices were well above 2002 levels continuing the pattern seen throughout 2003 The average price of natural gas to the electric power industry in July 2003 was 58 percent higher than a year earlier fuel oil was 30 percent above the June 2002 price Year to date natural gas and fuel oil prices were running respectively 72 percent and 54 percent above comparable 2002 levels Retail Sales Revenue and Average Revenue August 2003 Sales August 2003 retail electricity sales were 0 6 percent higher compared to August 2002 The sales increase was driven by the commercial sector which was up 1 5 percent Residential sector sales declined by 0 1 percent and industrial sector sales increased by 0 2 percent Year to date total sales were up 0 9 percent compared to 2002 led by the residential sector with a 1 7 percent gain Commercial sales were up 0 8 percent while industrial sales decreased by 0 3 percent Revenue Electricity revenues continue to show significant increases in 2003 compared to 2002 In August 2003 residential sector revenues increased by 4 9 percent from August 2002 commercial revenues were up 5 1 percent and industrial sector revenues grew by 4 5 percent The increase across all sectors was 5 1 percent Year to date total revenues were up 4 1 percent compared to 2002 Residential sector revenues increased by 4 4 percent and commercial revenues grew by 4 5 percent Industrial revenues were up by 2 2 percent The increase in revenues and average prices see immediately below are likely attributable to higher fuel prices Prices The average price of retail electricity increased 4 4 percent in August 2003 compared to August 2002 The residential sector showed the largest increase at 5 0 percent while the commercial sector increased by 3 6 percent and the industrial sector price increased by 4 4 percent Year to date the average price of electricity was up 3 0 percent compared to 2002 The commercial sector showed the largest increase at 3 7 percent followed by a 2 7 percent increase in the residential sector and a 2 5 percent increase in the industrial sector t1 1 For June 2003 price data see Energy Information Administration Electric Power Monthly October 2003 page 3 Table ES1 A The document can be accessed at
