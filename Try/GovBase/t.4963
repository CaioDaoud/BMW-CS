Biomedical Communications Projects in the Communications Engineering Branch CEB focus on research and development in image engineering the capture storage processing online retrieval transmission and display of both biomedical documents mainly journals and medical imagery Areas of active investigation center on image compression image enhancement image understanding pseudo grayscale rendition image transmission and networks omnifont text recognition and man machine interface design This applied research and development is directed toward the National Library of Medicine s NLM mission critical tasks such as document delivery archiving and preservation In addition research into imaging techniques that support medical education packages employing digitized radiographic dermatological and other imagery is also being pursued Turning the Pages Plus The Technology Under the Hood Constructing the book s spine with 3 D software Constructing the book s spine with 3 D software Take a tour
