requirements affecting communications with Commissioners went into effect Public Resources Code sections 30319 30324 These stringent new provisions of law may have serious consequences Anyone wishing to communicate with a Commissioner about any matter pending before the Commission should read and abide by the guidelines below The following guidance covers most of the new requirements No written materials should be sent to Coastal Commissioners unless the Commission address html staff receives copies of all of the same materials at the same time All materials transmitted to Commissioners should clearly indicate e g on the cover page or envelope that they have also been forwarded to the staff Materials that do not show that copies have been provided to staff might not be accepted opened or read by Commissioners In these cases no ex parte communication has occurred Messages of a non procedural nature e g substantive should not be left for a Commissioner These include telephone FAX telegraphic or other forms of message All oral or written communications of a non procedural nature by an interested person that are not made according to the above procedures are ex parte communications which are prohibited unless publicly reported by the Commissioner If the Commissioner does not report the communication the Commission s action that was the subject of the communication may be revoked and penalties may result Coastal Commission decisions must be made on the basis of information available to all commissioners and the public Therefore copies of communications made to Commissioners that are forwarded to staff will be included in the public record Public records are available for inspection at Commission meetings or in the Commission s office NOTE The purpose of these legal requirements is to protect due process and fairness in the Commission s decision making process Failure to follow them could lead to fines revocation of permits and substantial costs If you have any questions you can contact Commission legal staff
