Geologic Research on Environmental Hazard and Resource Issues affecting the Nation s Coastal and Marine Realms Coastal and Marine Geology Program logo U S Department of the Interior U S Geological Survey March 1997 preface Start Preface In June 1994 U S Geological Survey implemented a 5 year National Marine and Coastal Geology Plan outlining proposed studies and tentative budgets for understanding the coastal and offshore areas of the United States to be conducted within the Office of Marine Geology within the Geologic Division Since the plan was submitted and accepted by Congress several changes have occurred that affect the research program Departmental budgets have been level Funding from other outside sources have been modest USGS underwent a significant downsizing in staff Geologic Division has reorganized such that the Office of Marine Geology is now renamed the Coastal and Marine Geology Program and issues and opportunities for new studies that were unforeseen in the original plan have occurred These changes make it appropriate to outline new directions for the Coastal and Marine Program This document is intended to summarize the modifications that have occurred in the Coastal and Marine National Plan as a result of these changes An explanation and highlights of the changes from the 1994 plan included in this update is provided below overview Overview purpose Purpose themes Themes approach Approach environment Environment hazards Hazards resources Resources information Information Overview of External Factors and Changes Lower Budgets The original National Plan outlined a research program predicated on two budget scenarios full implementation of the Program with a budget estimate that increased from 63 5 M in the first year FY 1995 to 94 7 M in the fifth year 1999 and partial implementation with a budget that increased from 41 6 M to 55 1 M The actual budgets implemented in the first three years have been level funded at 37 1 M or about 24 below the partial implementation level projected for FY 1997 This lower number 37 1 M is now projected as the realistic level funded budget estimate for the near future Smaller Staff The downsizing of the Geologic Division resulted in a loss of research technical and non research support staff from the program This together with the lower than planned budgets limits the manpower available to apply to new or expanded studies and provides incentive for the program to undertake cooperative studies involving other government and non governmental investigators New Directions In an effort to remain flexible and responsive to national needs the Coastal and Marine Program has initiated several projects that were unanticipated when the original National Plan was written These projects reflect requests coming in from Congress other federal agencies DOI the states and academic collaborators A good example of these projects is the new coastal erosion study in south west Washington state begun in 1996 in cooperation with state and local partners Overview of Internal Changes New Directions and Trends All Themes Limited implementation and postponement of studies due to external changes noted above Identification of continuing and new Regions of Future Interest based on input from other Federal Agencies the States and from Division and Program staff Increased research support for DOI Bureau needs particularly NPS and MMS Environment Merged geologic records of environmental change subtheme with fundamental studies Merged SE US wetlands studies into one project Increased emphasis in Chesapeake Bay Ecosystem studies Increased emphasis on studies involving biologic component in response to NOAA NMFS and USGS BRD needs Hazards Initiated a coastal erosion study in southwest Washington at behest of the State and local concerns Initiated study of coastal landslide in Lake Michigan in cooperation with National Park Service Increased emphasis on earthquake and urban hazards in Pacific northwest and S California in response to Urban Hazards Initiative Increased recognition of tsunamis as a hazard study topic Resources Increased emphasis on coastal and nearshore aquifers in collaboration with USGS WRD Expand emphasis on nearshore sand and gravel resources to meet the needs of MMS USACE and many coastal states Increased emphasis on geologic impacts of resource extraction Develop sand and gravel resource studies as companions to pollution or erosion efforts Gas hydrate studies will add emphasis on effects of hydrocarbon extraction on hydrates in near surface sediments Decrease emphasis on deep water minerals studies Information and facilities Systematic mapping studies will be phased into regional studies under Themes 1 2 and 3 Mapping of US EEZ continental shelf remains a focus to be coordinated internally within the Program and with NOAA NOS Increased emphasis on information and assessments The rescue archive and distribution of samples data and information is increasingly important to the Coastal and Marine Program Increased emphasis on outreach and information exchange using the world wide web fact sheets videos in addition to traditional USGS products Purpose of Plan This document presents a 5 year plan for research and mapping activities to be conducted by the Coastal and Marine Geology Program of the U S Geological Survey USGS It is the updated edition of the program elements in the 5 year plan first produced in 19941 The program is designed to describe marine and coastal geologic systems to understand the fundamental processes that create modify and maintain them and to develop predictive models that provide understanding of natural systems the effects of man s activities on them and to provide a capability to predict future change The program addresses issues of national importance in the areas of environmental quality and preservation natural hazards and public safety and natural resources providing information and comprehensive understanding of marine and coastal geology for public benefit The program will provide information and products to guide the preservation and sustainable development of the Nation s marine and coastal environment of both the oceanic and Great Lakes coastal domains 1 The National Marine and Coastal Geology Program 1994 A plan developed by the U S Geological Survey at the request of the U S Congress Program Themes Research and mapping investigations conducted by the Coastal and Marine Geology Program are designed to describe marine and coastal systems understand the fundamental geologic processes that create modify and maintain them and develop predictive models Investigations address four themes Theme 1 environment Environmental quality and preservation to understand sediment and pollutant erosion transport and deposition fragile environments e g wetlands and coral reefs the importance of the sea lake floor environments as biological habitats and as record keepers of long term environmental change Theme 2 hazards Natural hazards and public safety to better understand the frequency and distribution of catastrophic events such as storms earthquakes and landslides the geologic processes acting in the affected marine and coastal regions such as coastal erosion and the local and regional susceptibility to change Theme 3 resources Natural resources to develop and extend understanding of the formation location and geologic setting of offshore mineral and petroleum resources the geologic effects of resource extraction and how offshore resource occurrence can help in the search for analogous onshore deposits of economic significance investigations address areas outside the U S EEZ that could potentially supply our Nation s needs for resources Theme 4 information Information and technology to develop and maintain a comprehensive source of multi disciplinary data and information that can be easily accessed and used by Government policy makers research scientists and the public and to maintain scientific instrumentation and platforms necessary to carry out research and mapping activities Approach Coastal and Marine Geology Program activities directed toward these issues follow several complementary and interdependent avenues of research Fundamental studies improve the understanding of geologic processes critical to enhancing predictive capabilities These critical processes are relevant to a variety of environments and hence knowledge can be applied nationwide and worldwide Regional studies develop a description and understanding of marine and coastal geologic systems where problems are significant and or the ability to understand fundamental processes have a high chance of success An objective of the Coastal and Marine Geology Program is to maintain an understanding of marine and coastal systems on a regional basis The program conducts regional studies throughout the U S EEZ and Great Lakes but also recognizes the international aspect of many issues e g coral reefs pollutant transport mineral resources which necessarily involves international collaborations Catastrophic event studies address the role that rare or large magnitude events play in geological systems Major storms or hurricanes earthquakes tsunamis major floods and pollutant discharges require rapid response and a long term commitment to the development of a baseline data set Long term observations define the time scales and the magnitude of variability in geologic systems Analyses of long term measurements are essential to successfully distinguish long term trends caused by anthropogenic effects from natural changes often suggest hypotheses about key processes identify new directions for investigation document catastrophic and or rare events and provide a range of conditions for model simulation and testing Assessments provide a systematic appraisal of the status of geologic systems or processes Initially these are undertaken in the context of regional studies eventually leading to national assessments In national assessments led by other Federal agencies the USGS provides marine and coastal geological expertise as needed preface To Document top Theme 1 Environmental Quality and Preservation fundamental environment Fundamental Studies pollution Pollution and Waste Disposal fragile Fragile Environments reserves and habitats Marine Reserves and Biologic Habitats The quality and preservation of natural environments have become leading concerns in the 1990 s and these concerns extend to Federal lands in the coastal and marine realm where increasing population pressure and human activities stress a wide variety of natural systems One of the broad goals of the Coastal and Marine Geology Program is to improve our scientific understanding of geologic factors which influence the long term quality and preservation of environments Geologic mapping and research investigations of geologic processes provide critical information to help understand natural and human stresses on the environment For example sediment dynamics studies and seabed mapping and sampling can provide an understanding of how pollutants and particles are transported deposited recycled and stored in marine and coastal settings Comparison of past and present environments allows distinction between natural and man induced changes Understanding the causes of long term change requires careful consideration of the geologic record for it is itself a record of change The issues include sea level changes brought about by altered climate and global tectonics as well as the influence of humans on natural geologic processes such as erosion sedimentation and the transport of sediments and pollutants in the marine and lacustrine realm Studies conducted under the Environmental Quality and Preservation theme include fundamental studies plus three subthemes 1 Pollution and Waste Disposal 2 Fragile Environments and 3 Marine Reserves and Biologic Habitats Phasing of regional studies is shown in a theme1 diagram figure at the end of this theme Fundamental Environmental Studies Scope of the Problem The USGS is committed to providing sound scientific knowledge and information needed to understand environmental quality and preservation on regional and national scales This broad view which is necessary to maintain credibility and to evaluate the potential success or failure of management and societal decisions is appropriate for Federal attention An ability to characterize understand and predict environmental change for national needs requires integration of basic research findings to the appropriate spatial and temporal scales Fundamental studies specifically address this integration in the development of large scale predictive skill based on basic research results Two elements of fundamental studies related to environmental studies theme are discussed below Objective The objective of the Fundamental Environmental Studies Subprogram is to increase our knowledge and understanding of the record and impact of geologic changes that occur in marine and coastal environments This will be addressed through studies that focus on the principle agents of change Subtheme Components Records of sedimentation climate and catastrophic events Changing rates of sediment erosion transport and deposition produce unique recognizable patterns in sedimentary records Past climates and related biological productivity is recorded in sedimentary sequences and such information helps understand and guide management of modern habitats Profound man induced changes are often seen locally and sometimes regionally Paleoclimate records also serve as tests for predictive numerical climate models Specific environments for study which are sensitive to sedimentary climatic and catastrophic changes can be found in bays and estuaries within lakes on continental margins and in polar regions Records of sea level change Evolution of many coastal and marine environments is strongly impacted by changing relative sea or lake levels including global water level change and land subsidence or uplift Local records of sea level change add to our understanding of regional and global sea level variations and give us better tools to predict the future of sea level change and its effects on U S coastlines Three regions for study that are particularly sensitive to fluctuations in sea level are coral reefs coastal wetlands and the continental margins 1 Pollution and Waste Disposal Scope of the Problem Many of the continental shelves coasts lakes and estuaries within U S waters particularly near urban centers contain polluted sediment Heavy metals radioactive waste organic chemicals and nutrients have been introduced to these environments through natural processes by intentional disposal and by accidental spills The contaminants are derived from both point sources such as industrial discharge and sewage treatment plants and non point sources such as agricultural and urban run off and atmospheric deposition The presence of such materials in the Nation s coastal waters and lakes and their accumulation in sediment have created problems associated with health and safety biological resources and recreational activities Dredging and environmentally sound disposal of contaminated and non contaminated material is essential to the commercial viability of many U S ports There is considerable public concern and political attention focused on the impact of past and present use of our waters as waste disposal sites The behavior and interaction of polluted sediment with the sea floor environment are strongly influenced by substrate geology and sediment transport processes For example many pollutants chemically and physically bind to fine grained sediment Mobilization and transport of the host sediment by waves and currents result in movement of the pollutants Therefore adequately addressing the issues of pollutant accumulation and transport requires an increased understanding of both the local geology and the key sedimentary processes that transport and distribute sediment Objectives The objectives of the Pollution and Waste Disposal Subtheme are to 1 identify and map the extent of sediment deposits and associated contaminants on the sea floor 2 understand the processes by which pollutants and waste material interact with and accumulate in sedimentary deposits 3 improve our knowledge of transport of sedimentary particles and associated pollutants and 4 increase our understanding of the processes by which pollutants migrate through subsurface deposits and are reintroduced to the seabed and water column Setting Priorities Tasks of the Pollution and Waste Disposal subtheme are directed at high priority areas such as estuaries and coastal regions near densely populated urban areas and sensitive ecosystems experiencing environmental degradation Studies in different regions will be undertaken in a phased approach In some cases regions may be revisited with new studies that address geologic processes concerns and questions that come to light during initial studies Definition of needs within each study area will depend on priorities of the 30 coastal states and other Federal agencies Subtheme Components FUNDAMENTAL STUDIES To maintain scientific credibility and to achieve a predictive capability and a quantitative understanding of pollutant fate and transport fundamental scientific advances are needed in the measurement and quantification of sediment transport the chemistry of sediment pollutant interactions the definition of sedimentary environments and the physics and biology of sediment mixing processes Models are needed to predict coastal and estuarine sediment dynamics and to define the circulation patterns of water that carry mixtures of dissolved and particulate materials The studies of contaminated sediments require continual improvement of remote sensing technology and the technology used for rapidly characterizing and mapping bottom sediment and dating cores for the past century REGIONAL STUDIES Nationwide there is great variability in the sources and types of pollutants in the sediment types within which pollutants accumulate and in the processes that transport deposit and remobilize pollutants Within regions studies are undertaken to identify the distribution source transport pathways and fate of pollutants Factors influencing sediment and associated pollutant transport include harbor development dams on streams discharging into the urban ocean sewage outfalls man induced initiation of coastal landslides and sever pollution of urban streams The objectives and approaches for each study are tailored to the needs of each specific region Common components of regional studies include Geologic Framework and Mapping Maps of sediment parameters from seabed sampling swath acoustic mapping and subbottom profiling are used to identify sites of particulate accumulation and for the design of monitoring programs Recent Geochronology Dated sediment cores are used to establish chronologies of the past 100 years for determining pollutant fluxes sediment budgets and as a tie to historic events Process Studies Regional studies investigate sediment dynamics geochemistry and animal sediment interactions that lead to resuspension recycling and transport and accumulation of sediment associated pollutants Present Regional Studies listed geographically east to west New York New Jersey Metropolitan Area Long Island Sound South Florida Lake Pontchartrain Los Angeles Shelf San Francisco Bay Puget Sound Honolulu Dump Site Areas of future interest for Regional Studies Chesapeake Bay Puerto Rico Great Lakes San Diego Tijuana Santa Barbara Channel Arctic Ocean LONG TERM MONITORING AND OBSERVATIONS Long term observations define the time scales and the magnitude of variability in geologic systems and provide a description of the mean condition as well as the seasonal interannual and climatic variability Such descriptions are essential to successfully distinguish long term trends caused by anthropogenic effects from the effects of natural changes including catastrophic events Finally long time series data provide a range of conditions for model simulation and an important test for numerical and analytical models These need a prescribed tenure following completion of validation Present Regional Study Massachusetts Bay Areas of future interest for Regional Monitoring Deep Water Dump Site 106 South Florida Los Angeles Shelf San Francisco Bay 2 Fragile Environments Scope of the Problem Many coastal lacustrine and marine fragile environments including coastal wetlands coral reefs seagrass beds and polar ecosystems have been impacted and degraded during the past century by a combination of natural processes and the activities of mankind Over the past several decades the impacts of human activities have accelerated and in spite of increased awareness and concern for the environment fragile habitats such as wetlands and reefs continue to deteriorate Other unique environments such as those hosting submarine seep and vent biologic communities are relatively unknown but potentially important Conserving these environments and preventing further degradation as well as restoring some areas requires sound scientific understanding of the geologic processes currents sediment flux and the geologic framework morphology structure sediment distribution in which the dominant processes operate Baseline information is also critical for evaluating the short and long term effects of catastrophic events on fragile coastal and marine ecosystems Coastal wetlands a fragile transitional zone between marine and terrestrial environments have significant economic and intrinsic ecological value Healthy coastal wetlands require the right mix of fresh and salt water sediment and other physical parameters to provide a stable base for growth of vegetation They are the most productive ecosystems known providing nutrients and habitats that support the entire coastal ecosystem Eighty percent of the Nation s coastal commercial and recreational fisheries depend upon wetlands for spawning hatching and nursery activities Coastal wetlands also play vital roles as habitats for wildlife waterfowl and migratory birds Wetlands function to filter pollutants and to hold and absorb water which can reduce flood peaks Coral reef ecosystems in the Florida Keys Hawaii and the U S affiliated islands in the Pacific and Caribbean thrive in clear nutrient poor waters These systems generally overlie porous and permeable limestone providing pathways for the movement of toxic and nutrient rich ground water Small increases in the nutrient content of coastal waters associated with fertilizer and sewage discharge may upset the fragile balance necessary to maintain the health of economically important coral reefs Additional detrimental effects may be caused as well by increased turbidity due to anthropogenic activity and by increased salinity due to poor water management practices Objectives The objectives of these studies are to increase our scientific understanding of the delicate balance of geological processes necessary to maintain the Nation s fragile coastal and marine environments and to improve our capability to predict ecosystem response to both natural processes and human activities Setting Priorities Regional studies consider several factors including rapid loss or high degree of stress on ecosystems extent of present or former wetlands and locations where information on geologic processes or history is needed for management or restoration Subprogram Components FUNDAMENTAL STUDIES Wetlands and coastal ecosystems are a dynamic balance between terrestrial and aquatic influences and are extremely sensitive to changes in both water level and water availability Annual cycles as well as longer term climate cycles are important aspects of wetland studies Wetlands respond to water level change by growth and migration which indicates erosion or accretion of sediment At present knowledge of the supply and redistribution of sediment within many wetlands and coastal ecosystems is limited Better understanding will be achieved through fundamental studies focusing on the mechanisms of sediment transport and on the balance between depositional and erosional processes driven by coastal storms and currents REGIONAL STUDIES Nationwide wetlands are highly diverse Studies within different regions are being undertaken to understand the geologic processes and controls for specific systems The objectives and research approaches of each study are being tailored to specific regions although each study has common components Present Regional Studies Gulf of Mexico Southeast Coastal Wetlands San Francisco Bay Areas of future interest for Regional Studies Great Lakes Louisiana Wetlands Coral reefs Alaska 3 Marine Reserves and Biologic Habitats Scope of the Problem Sound management of the special marine and coastal areas that have been set aside for conservation and or sustainable use for the benefit of future generations is dependent upon comprehensive scientific information These special areas include the National Marine Sanctuaries National Seashores National Marine Parks areas designated in the USEPA Bays Programs and other Federal coastal and estuarine reserves The 1972 Marine Protection Research and Sanctuaries Act defines marine sanctuaries as areas of special national significance due to their resource or human use values with respect to conservation recreational ecological historical research educational or aesthetic value of the sanctuary Eleven National Marine Sanctuaries have been designated and five additional ones proposed For effective management most of them require a multidisciplinary scientific program which evaluates present environmental conditions and describes the processes and rates of change Environmental conditions depend on physical chemical geological and biological processes which are linked in many ways Thus marine geological studies are a fundamental part of the broad studies required for accurate understanding of these environments The Nation s marine biological habitats play a vital role in the life cycles of commercial and recreational fisheries species in the maintenance of biological diversity and in the protection of coastlines from erosion Habitat substrate or sedimentary environment is of critical importance to the reproduction and survival of benthic organisms and other species that spend a part of their life cycle in on or near the seabed At present biological habitats in many of the Nation s coastal and offshore regions are being impacted by human activities which include overfishing physical disturbance of the seabed by fishing gear and pollution from runoff and waste disposal Important geologic attributes of biological habitats include sediment texture and consistency bottom morphology strength of near bottom currents and erosion transport and deposition of sediments As noted in a recent study Working Together in the EEZ by the National Research Council coastal States require information on bathymetry seabed imagery and sediment characterization for the assessment and monitoring of biological resources Objectives The objectives of the Marine Reserves and Biologic Habitats Subprogram are to gather interpret and distribute geologic information about areas that are identified as of national importance either as a biologic resource or for their intrinsic value Research will be conducted with agencies and colleagues contributing biological expertise in order to maximize the value of geologic information to Federal and State resource management agencies Setting Priorities Studies of marine reserves and biologic habitats are regionally prioritized using a combination of the following factors 1 Interest from and cooperation with State and Federal NOAA NMFS USGS BRD FWS marine resource managers and biologists 2 significant commercial or recreational value or presence of endangered species and 3 a clear role of the coast sediments and sea floor in the life histories of organisms Subtheme Components REGIONAL STUDIES The research effort maps selected reserves and habitats quantifies the effects of both natural processes and human activities and identifies predictable natural cycles or trends of habitat change Emphasis and scope varies depending on specific problems and needs in individual areas Two approaches are used mapping and geologic characterization of the sea floor and sediment deposits and identifying and investigating the key geologic processes that affect critical regions Mapping and Characterization is a major under taking of this research program The goal is a description of sea floor geology with direct linkages to important biological habitats identified by cooperating agencies Digital interpretive maps of the seabed in each study area will define sediment texture and rock types morphology sediment pollutant concentrations and geological structures along with infauna epifuana and fisheries species Geologic processes are being identified that shape the present seafloor geologic environment and influence how it changes Objectives include evaluation of the natural and anthropogenic fluxes of sediments and associated pollutants characterization of physical oceanographic processes description of the interaction of biology and geology particularly with respect to bioturbation evaluation of seafloor to erosion and deposition and evaluation of vulnerability to catastrophic events such as storms oil and chemical spills floods earthquakes tsunamis and sea level change MARINE RESERVES Present Regional Studies Stellwagen Bank Florida Keys Monterey Bay Areas of future interest for Regional Studies East Coast National Seashore Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuary Olympic Coast National Marine Sanctuary BIOLOGIC HABITATS Biodiversity and productivity of marine systems are major global issues and geologic conditions and processes play an extremely important role There is the potential to conduct studies in collaboration with USGS BRD and other agencies and institutions We anticipate increased need for cooperative funding to provide additional biological expertise to the USGS This expertise would carry out investigations linking biology to the sea floor environment and to sediment transport processes including the important inshore nursery areas in estuarine and brackish environments Present Regional Studies Georges Bank Florida Southeast Alaska Bering Sea Areas of future interest for Regional Studies Gulf of Maine Great Lakes Gulf of Alaska LONG TERM MONITORING AND OBSERVATIONS Long term monitoring programs during which periodic observations will be make to detect the impact of human activities and natural processes on the habitat will be an important part of many studies Monitoring is a logical and essential follow up to mapping characterization and process investigations as it provides an opportunity to assess change to a system Establishing the rate at which environmental degradation is presently taking place will include a compilation and critical review of historical data as well as an examination of the recent geologic record and measurement of processes theme1gif htm Theme 1 Diagram Planned Timing of Environmental Studies 17K preface To Document top environment To Environment theme top Theme 2 Natural Hazards and Public Safety coastal erosion Coastal and Nearshore Erosion earthquakes etc Earthquakes Tsunamis and Landslides Hazards in the marine and coastal realm result from geologic processes acting across a wide range of spatial and temporal scales Sudden catastrophic changes result from earthquakes landslides and hurricanes Processes acting on longer time scales may result in coastal erosion and an increased susceptibility to flooding and landslides Research within this theme is conducted to better understand the frequency and distribution of catastrophic events the geologic processes acting in the affected coastal regions and the local and regional susceptibility to process driven change Studies conducted under the Natural Hazards and Public Safety theme are grouped into two subthemes 1 Coastal and Nearshore Erosion and 2 Offshore Earthquakes Tsunamis and Landslides The objectives are to understand the origin of natural geologic hazards in the marine and coastal environment and the impact on people property and the environment Phasing of regional studies is shown in a theme2 diagram figure at the end of this theme 1 Coastal and Nearshore Erosion Scope of the Problem Coastal erosion is a serious national problem with long term economic and social consequences All 30 States bordering an ocean or Great Lake have erosion problems and 26 are presently experiencing net loss of their shores Erosion is likely to increase in the future as a consequence of sea level rise due to climate change Developed areas are threatened with potential loss of life and billions of dollars in property damage as a result of storm impacts and long term erosion Coastal erosion also threatens wetlands and estuarine environments that are highly valued as nurseries for commercial and recreational fisheries Regional differences in the geology and environmental factors such as winds tides storm waves and storm frequency result in a great diversity of problems The erosion of the shoreline is the most visible result of a complex system of sediment transport and redistribution both along the coast and across the coastal region This system driven by a variety of natural and anthropogenic processes across a range of environments may result in a net loss of sand to the beach areas and may involve the movement of sediment across the entire continental shelf Lack of sediment in the coastal zone can also be aggravated by mankind s activities such as dams trapping sediment and badly designed coastal engineering structures Fragile and economically important ecosystems may be threatened by the redistribution of sediment or the associated transport of contaminants and waste products Coastal and shelf sedimentary environments evolve as a result of sediment transport and investigations of the processes controlling material transport in all marine environments will provide managers of coastal and offshore marine environments with necessary information on the nature of threats to coastal communities and marine and coastal preserves and ecosystems Objectives The objective of the Coastal and Nearshore Erosion subtheme is to understand the geological environment within which erosion transport and deposition of sediment occur and ultimately to predict erosion caused by natural processes and human activities At present our understanding of the processes leading to coastal erosion is rudimentary Without understanding the processes prediction is difficult and unreliable Setting Priorities Components of the Coastal and Nearshore Erosion Subtheme in different regions will be undertaken in a phased approach In some cases regions may be revisited with new studies of different focus that address geologic processes concerns and questions that come to light during initial studies Key factors in prioritizing studies include rapid rates of erosion potential for significant impact to wetlands developed urban communities and infrastructure the impact of engineering structures on coastal habitats and sediment transport and collaboration with States and Federal agencies such as FEMA USACE NOAA and NPS High priority areas include regions where coastal and wetlands loss has recently accelerated the highly developed coasts of Florida and the mid Atlantic region and islands with limited land area Subtheme Components FUNDAMENTAL STUDIES The USGS is committed to providing scientific knowledge and information applicable to coastal erosion and sediment transport on regional scales This broad view is necessary to evaluate the potential success or failure of mitigation efforts and management plans Focus on site specific problems and processes fails to incorporate the controls imposed by large scale processes An ability to understand and predict changes occurring on a regional scale requires integration of basic research findings to the appropriate spatial and temporal scales These studies would specifically address this integration in the development of large scale predictive skill based on detailed research results Particular emphasis would be directed toward a better understanding of the processes that transport sediment in the nearshore and across the inner continental shelf Identifying the critical processes as well as the role of chronic versus extreme events the impact of man made structures and their combined contribution to the long term evolution of coastal sedimentary systems is needed for the development of predictive models Areas of Program interest Coastal Erosion Fundamental Studies Catastrophic Storms Regional studies of cross shelf sediment transport REGIONAL STUDIES OF COASTAL EROSION There is great variability in the processes causing coastal erosion and in the geologic framework within which the processes operate Studies within different regions will be undertaken to understand the geologic framework within which erosion takes place the diversity of processes the sediment budget for specific regions along with the potential for sand resources and implications of extracting offshore sand for beach nourishment Present Regional Studies South Carolina West Central Florida Southwest Washington Hawaii Regions of Future Interest for Regional Studies Delaware Maryland Virginia North Carolina Southeast Florida Puerto Rico Lake Erie South Texas Central Southern California 2 Earthquakes Tsunamis and Landslides Scope of the Problem Many of the largest and most damaging earthquakes in the world occur near the coastal regions of tectonically active continents and islands both onshore and offshore These regions include the entire California Oregon Washington and Alaska margins some areas of the East Coast particularly Puerto Rico and the U S Virgin Islands and western Pacific areas such as Guam and the Commonwealth of the Northern Marianas Catastrophic earthquakes such as the 1906 San Francisco earthquake and the 1964 Good Friday Alaska earthquake occurred offshore and are strong indicators of the high level of risk to which all of the Nation s west coast metropolitan regions are subjected Less commonly recognized are the historic damaging earthquakes that have occurred in other geographic regions such as the 1886 Charleston South Carolina earthquake Because of the large and growing number of people and the enormous value of property and societal infrastructure in coastal areas that are at risk from seismic activity on offshore faults and associated tsunamis research targeted at marine earthquake hazard identification is an important element of the Coastal and Marine Geology Program These studies will be done in conjunction with the USGS Geologic Hazards Program Undersea and coastal landslides also pose a hazard to property and life in the coastal zone For example 1 communities in Alaska were badly damaged and lives were lost as a result of undersea landslides associated with the 1964 Good Friday earthquake 2 offshore drilling platforms have been destroyed by landslides caused by hurricane waves 3 recent evidence suggests that volcanic islands such as the Hawaiian Island chain are vulnerable to catastrophic giant landslides that can remove a third or more of individual islands in a single event and 4 Puget Sound is bordered by developed bluffs that have experienced major landslide failures during prehistoric earthquakes To reduce the hazard posed by these slope failures we must develop a quantitative understanding of the factors leading to the initiation and progression of submarine and coastal landslides This understanding will lead to practical methodologies to predict the effects of landslides on human life and property Both submarine earthquakes and catastrophic submarine landslides have the potential for generating tsunamis which pose significant hazards for coastal communities Examples include the 1964 Alaska earthquake the giant Hawaiian landslides and the 1918 earthquake off Puerto Rico Better understanding is required of the source regions mechanisms and recurrence intervals of tsunami generating events and of the nearshore morphology that affects tsunami run up in coastal regions Objectives The objectives of the Offshore Earthquakes and Landslides subtheme are 1 to understand the geologic environment and recent history of great earthquakes landslides and tsunami in the marine realm 2 to evaluate the future potential and probable impacts of such events on a regional basis and 3 to make research results available in an effective form for application in evaluations of seismic risk zonation development and land use patterns engineering and building codes seismic retrofitting and public disaster education and preparedness Setting priorities Important factors used in setting priorities for regional studies include frequency and size of earthquakes and landslides population and potential to collaborate with other USGS hazards studies Highest priority areas are the tectonically active margins of the Pacific coast followed the Caribbean plate southern Alaska and Hawaii and Pacific Trust territories Subtheme Components FUNDAMENTAL STUDIES All applied scientific observations and conclusions that can be used for societally important purposes must be based on a sound scientific foundation Often advances can be achieved as a by product of directed regional investigations A continuous program component of fundamental studies would include specific non regionally focused topics such as active margin tectonics seismically induced submarine liquefaction of sands submarine volcanism earthquake model studies asteroid impact and improving our ability to identify unstable slopes REGIONAL STUDIES The primary focus is to develop the best information and knowledge possible of the marine crustal structure and processes for those specific offshore and coastal regions that are at greatest risk A long term multidisciplinary research program is required that addresses such factors as 1 the most likely geographic locations of future damaging earthquakes tsunamis and landslides 2 their frequency and history of occurrence and 3 the styles of deformation and the destructive effects that have a strong likelihood of affecting coastal property and populations All these investigations will be conducted in close cooperation with the on land focused studies of the Geologic Hazards Reduction Program of the USGS Present Regional Studies Caribbean Plate Southern California Central California Pacific Northwest West Coast Tsunamis Great Lakes Landslides Regions of Future Interest Alaska and Aleutian Subduction Zone Hawaii Landslides Tsunami Studies theme2gif htm Theme 2 Diagram Planned Timing of Natural Hazard Studies 13K preface To Document top hazards To Hazards theme top Theme 3 Natural Resources aquifers Water Coastal Aquifers minerals Mineral Resources energy Energy Resources Studies conducted under the Natural Resources theme are grouped into three Subthemes 1 Water Resources coastal aquifers 2 Mineral Resources and 3 Energy Resources The Theme focus is coordinated with the interest needs and activities of USGS WRD MMS USACE and the USGS Minerals Program Mineral and energy resource studies also involve international activities reflecting the major source for many resources To evaluate resource potentials and effects of their recovery in a way that is meaningful to various user communities we need to upgrade our current data base conduct experiments that elucidate the processes of formation alteration and emplacement of these resources construct more realistic resource models than currently exist and effectively evaluate geologic aspects of recovery e g habitat modification altered sedimentation patterns Information gained from these investigations will also help determine how the formation presence and exploitation of these resources impacts marine ecosystems Phasing of regional studies is shown in a theme3 diagram figure at the end of this theme 1 Water Resources Coastal Aquifers Scope of the Problem Water is the substance that makes all life on Earth possible However in many coastal communities declining ground water levels have led to salt water intrusion in previously pristine aquifers The sediments on continental margins are inextricably linked to the hydrogeologic cycle of coastal regions because they contain vast reservoirs of fresh water and provide the pressure heads that control the subsurface flow The intent of defining a water resources element within the Natural Resources plan is to focus on the role of offshore geology in understanding coastal aquifers Note that hydrothermal studies are covered under Mineral Resources component of this Theme below Fresh and salt water flow are known to form a dynamic system on the continental margin for example fresh water springs have long been known off the southeast U S coast and brine seeps have enabled unusual chemosynthetic biological communities to develop in deep water on the continental margin off Florida California and Alaska Saltwater intrusion into fresh water aquifers in coastal areas illustrates that human activities can alter the flow unfavorably Along the East Coast onshore and offshore coastal aquifers form essentially contiguous regional units between Rhode Island and Florida Little is known however about the details of the distribution hydrology and volume of fresh water in the coastal offshore region or the extent of its connection with onshore aquifers Understanding water flow and its links to subsurface geology on the coastal margin is critical not only to human utilization of coastal aquifers How water and other fluids flow through continental margin deposits its interaction with the host sediments and the relative role that changing sea level plays are poorly known Objectives The fundamental objective of the Water Resources Subtheme is to understand the distribution and geological characteristics of fluid transport in coastal aquifers and marine environments in conjunction with USGS WRD Part of this objective involves determining fluid and mass fluxes and linkages between sites of fluid outflow inflow and local sea floor ecology Setting Priorities The Coastal and Marine Geology Program is well suited to tackle studies related to water resources and aquifers on the continental margin because of the expertise on the regional extent and composition of deposits in coastal and offshore areas Investigations will be coordinated with other multidisciplinary research efforts primarily in partnership with USGS WRD programs but also with other Federal State and local agencies studying the relevant onshore aquifers Subtheme Components COASTAL AQUIFERS Studies are designed to understand the processes related to those aquifers that introduce fresh water into marine settings salt water into fresh water settings or store fresh water in marine sedimentary reservoirs These studies will involve the synthesis of regional geologic data development of models of fluid flow mixing processes discharge and mass and fluid flux analysis of water chemistry wherever possible and development of strategies and technologies for identification of additional potential offshore aquifers Regions of future interest East Coast of the U S Florida Keys Florida west coast Great Lakes Puerto Rico West Coast of the U S 2 Marine Mineral Resources Scope of the Problem A stable supply of minerals is essential to the economic health of our Nation and to a sustainable standard of living for all of our people We have had a continuous increase in dependence on foreign supplies for most minerals in past decades Strategic and critical minerals for which the U S is almost completely dependent on foreign sources such as manganese nickel platinum and cobalt are potentially available within the U S EEZ The EEZ and Great Lakes also offer potential availability of vast deposits of sand and gravel phosphorite and other minerals many discovered only in the past 15 years but poorly known Offshore sand and gravel sources are being sought by many States for aggregate supply and to replenish eroded beaches Evaluation and decision making at local State and Federal levels requires objective information about the mineral resources as well as the sea floor geologic and environmental systems in which they are located The Division s Minerals Program and the Minerals Management Service are key partners in defining and addressing minerals issues for the Program It is becoming increasingly apparent that the investigation of sea floor mineral resources is closely related to our understanding geologic processes such as sediment dynamics plate tectonics the exchange of heat and mass between the earth s crust and seawater and linkages between minerals deposits and living organisms co existing on the sea floor These relationships have implications for such diverse fields as global climate change marine biotechnology fisheries and wildlife management Objectives The overall objective of the Marine Mineral Resources Subtheme is to improve understanding of the geological geophysical and geochemical characteristics of nearshore and offshore mineral deposits the geological systems in which the deposits form and the processes and chemical fluxes that lead to mineral concentrations Setting Priorities Components of the Mineral Resources Subprogram include fundamental research regional studies and environmental effects of extraction Three subgroups of deposits are considered 1 sand gravel and heavy mineral concentrates formed in coastal and shelf settings by sedimentary processes 2 phosphorites and iron manganese crusts formed in continental shelf margin and deep ocean settings by low temperature hydrogenetic processes and 3 polymetallic sulfide and oxide deposits formed at oceanic rift zones island arcs and mid plate volcanoes by high temperature hydrothermal processes Subtheme Components FUNDAMENTAL STUDIES Geologic models for mineral deposit formation as well as models of the impact of minerals extraction are based on data obtained by mapping sampling geophysical surveys and laboratory analyses At present we do not have a clear understanding of the origin of most accumulations of mineral resources and the models accordingly are incomplete To improve our understanding we will conduct investigations of critical processes and test hypotheses on the origin of the resources Laboratory investigations involving experiments that simulate field conditions may also be conducted REGIONAL STUDIES Mineral resources occur in a wide variety of coastal and marine environments and are the products of a wide range of concentrating processes Regional studies focus on understanding the geologic framework and processes of formation of marine mineral deposits and also provide information relevant to environmental concerns of exploration and development Improved exploration models for analogous mineral deposits on land depend on a better understanding of where and how deposits form on the sea floor Geologic Framework The investigations would treat the mineral deposits as a component of a geological system In the case of sand and gravel collaboration with other nearshore projects in the Program will be essential Recoverable hard minerals in coastal settings occur primarily in unconsolidated sediments requiring an emphasis on geophysical profiling and coring at shallow depths The study of hard mineral substrates in deeper waters requires bathymetric and sonar imaging of the sea floor photographic surveys subbottom profiling and dredge and core sampling Cooperative surveys with other USGS programs other agencies such as NOAA and MMS and academic institutions including the MMS Marine Minerals Technology Centers would be emphasized Processes of Formation The formation of sea floor mineral deposits is related to a variety of geologic processes A clear understanding of these processes and how they influence the distribution size and composition of deposits is needed Since mineral forming processes on the sea floor involve exchange of large amounts of heat and mass between the ocean crust and seawater a contribution can also be made to our understanding of natural variations in global ocean chemistry and global climate change Environmental Concerns The consequences of exploration and development of mineral resources can best be assessed where the physical chemical and biological processes that operate in the environment surrounding the resource are adequately understood The environmental costs associated with their utilization bear strongly on their economic potential Baseline studies in areas of leasing interest can be subsequently used to evaluate the geologic effects of dredging or mining that result in changing the sea or lake floor morphology and environment SAND AND GRAVEL AGGREGATE Resource and environmental studies related to sand and gravel resources will primarily be supplements to Pollution or Coastal Erosion regional studies under Themes 1 and 2 Regions of emphasis respond to input from MMS and USACE Region of Present Study Hawaii Regions of Future

California Borderland HIGH TEMPERATURE HYDROTHERMAL DEPOSITS sulfide deposits Regions of Program Interest Northeast Pacific Ridges Western Pacific Island Arcs Hawaii Johnston Island RESOURCE ASSESSMENTS To evaluate resource potentials in a way that is meaningful to various user communities we need to 1 expand our current database including placing heterogeneous data scattered through the literature in a readily accessible format 2 construct new resource models and 3 determine the impacts on co existing marine ecosystems of the formation presence and exploitation of mineral deposits Assessment of the economic potential would include 1 the development of a geologic model of the deposits in a specific area to include the dimensions composition grade of the deposit and where necessary amount of overburden and 2 an economic evaluation of the resource based on current economic models 3 Energy Resources Scope of the Problem Energy is a primary natural resource upon which our society is dependent The availability of energy resources determines our level of socio economic development and facilitates society s pursuit of innumerable goals and objectives The two oil shocks of the 1970s and the recent Gulf war serve as powerful reminders of the pivotal role of energy in both local and global economies About one half of the world s petroleum supply will come from the Middle East by the year 2010 The national interest therefore is well served by a strong program that addresses the geological systems and processes that determine the accumulation and preservation of conventional and unconventional energy resources in the marine environment Offshore conventional energy deposits mostly oil and natural gas represent a significant component of the energy resource potential of the Nation Within the last decade research has also shown that most continental margins are reservoirs for a potential new unconventional energy deposit tremendous amounts of methane gas literally frozen in gas hydrates in the uppermost few hundred meters of sediment In general available scientific information in these deep frontier areas is inadequate to construct geologic models that reliably predict either the processes that have formed the continental margin or its buried energy deposits Consequently the resource availability and economic potential of these energy resources is difficult to evaluate Knowledge of the processes that interact to control the genesis and evolution of the continental margin rock systems is essential for prudent stewardship of these energy reserves and to understand and predict the environmental consequences associated with their development and exploitation Objectives The primary objective of the Energy Resources Subtheme is to improve understanding of the complex and dynamic geological processes that have formed continental margins so as to better understand the genesis accumulation and preservation of associated energy deposits Related to this objective is understanding the environmental and geologic changes to the environment that result from extraction Setting Priorities Studies are designed to place energy resources in the context of the regional geological systems in which they were formed and preserved and to better understand modern sedimentary analogs of source and reservoir rocks Studies addressing the impact of energy extraction on the environment are considered here but also overlap considerably with Environmental studies in Theme 1 The Division s Energy Program and the Minerals Management Service are key partners in defining and addressing energy issues for the Marine Program The primary factors determining regional research is the potential extent of the resource and defining a research role for the USGS that compliments activities of other Federal programs and private industry A second factor is the opportunity for cooperative investigations with other agencies MMS DOE the USGS Energy Program the energy industry and other activities of the Coastal and Marine Geology Program Subtheme Components FUNDAMENTAL STUDIES Conceptual geological models are the foundation upon which to build successful exploration and preservation strategies for energy resources and to understand the environments in which they occur The focus of fundamental studies will be on the development of new predictive models for the physical thermal and chemical evolution of deposits on the continental margins within the U S EEZ and on the effects of climate and sea level changes on the occurrence and quality of petroleum source rocks in modern marine environments and their application to global exploration strategies onshore and offshore GAS HYDRATES Immense amounts of gas are concentrated in frozen ice like gas hydrates within the uppermost several hundred meters of sediment in deep water on the continental margins of the US from the Gulf of Mexico to the Alaska Arctic The worldwide amount of carbon in gas hydrates may be twice that of all other fossil fuels on Earth and the amount of methane may be 3 000 times the amount in the present atmosphere Therefore gas hydrates are significant to the world s energy resources and to global climate change Studies need to focus on regional in situ geophysical and drilling studies along with companion laboratory experiments of methane in sediments and theoretical models Area of Present Program focus Laboratory and Modeling Studies Areas of Future Program Interest Effects of Hydrocarbon and or Hydrate Extraction at Sea floor Gulf of Mexico Blake Ridge Southeast U S Margin Pacific Northwest Margin OIL AND GAS Many of the most productive oil and gas producing fields are developed in rock units that originated along continental margins The continental margins also contain numerous modern analogs to older petroliferous strata for which depositional setting mode of origin and preservation are poorly understood Large tracts of the continental margin thought to be beyond production because the oil reservoirs are too deeply buried or because they are in water too deep to economically drill are being developed The focus of this component will be to characterize and understand the modern analogs of marine hydrocarbon deposits Many of these studies will also overlap with of environmental and hazards processes

Resources theme top Theme 4 Information and Technology mapping Systematic Mapping info bank Information Bank info assessments Assessment and Evaluation technology Technology Geologic information data and assessments about the characteristics of the coastal and offshore geology are critical for wise management and multi use decisions Activities under the Information and Technology theme are grouped into four Subthemes Systematic Mapping of the Coast and Sea Floor Coastal and Marine Information Bank Assessments and Evaluation of the Information Bank and Technology and Facilities The overall goals are to coordinate geologic mapping of the coastal and EEZ sea floor environment to develop and maintain a comprehensive description and synthesis of information and knowledge about the geologic systems of the coast and US EEZ and to be a national source of information about the geology of the Nation s marine realms that facilitates the management and protection of the marine environment and resources Priorities and phasing are shown in the theme4 diagram figure at the end of this theme 1 Systematic Mapping of the Coast and Sea Floor Scope of the Problem Systematic mapping of the coast and sea floor throughout the entire submerged U S territory including the Great Lakes and major estuaries has been a component of the Coastal and Marine Geology Program for the last decade In 1984 shortly after proclamation of the Exclusive Economic Zone EEZ the USGS began reconnaissance level geologic mapping of the deep water portions of this vast area Mapping was also initiated in selected areas of the coast and shallow sea floor near urban centers in association with studies that address important hazards and environmental issues The primary map elements include shore line and bathymetric change maps side scan sonar and multi beam swath mosaic maps and geomorphic analysis Other geologic information is collected routinely during the mapping operations such as coastal and subbottom profiles The image data is combined with other data sets using computer Geographic Information System GIS techniques along with geologic interpretations Objectives The primary objective of the Systematic Mapping of the Coast and Sea Floor Subtheme is to acquire process and assemble reconnaissance level acoustic maps which provide base maps for studies under Themes 1 2 and 3 as well as for other federal state and local agencies These maps show morphology bathymetry sediment or rock type as well as man made structures or debris The information is then interpreted to create reconnaissance geologic maps that provide the foundation for specific topical investigations Setting Priorities The investigations under this subtheme are focused on mapping the coastal and shelf EEZ Highest priorities are initiation of systematic mapping in selected regions of the shallow EEZ near metropolitan centers These priorities will 1 augment and compliment issue based investigations within Themes 1 2 and 3 and 2 be closely tied to cooperator partners with well defined needs and with funding support This is in keeping with the major information needs of users of the EEZ USGS NMD NOAA NOS USACE MMS NPS EPA and FEMA State and Local Agencies As part of these studies surveys will be carried out 1 in areas of intensive sea floor use 2 where activities have affected or may affect the coastal environment such as sites of pollution or waste disposal 3 where geologic information is necessary for management and or preservation of resources such as biological habitats wetlands and National Marine Reserves 4 where hazards exist such as areas of coastal erosion or earthquakes 5 and where monitoring sites are established to assess long term environmental change Over the long term standard paper and Mapping is considered here as a unifying long term goal to map high priority regions of the nearshore EEZ using consistent standards Over the long term the sum of these studies will provide extensive coverage of the shallow US EEZ and standard national procedures and products will be produced Subtheme Components MAPPING THE COAST AND NEARSHORE EEZ In the next decade the coast and shallow portion of the U S EEZ water depths less than 500 m and estuaries will be a major priority for USGS investigations and surveys These areas are used for recreation transportation and waste disposal contain most of the currently harvested fisheries resources provide habitat for juvenile and endangered species are valued for their aesthetics and are most affected by human activities NATIONAL COORDINATION Because of technical and logistical constraints of coastal and nearshore mapping systematic mapping is presently a time intensive effort Mapping of the shallow EEZ will be accomplished by starting in critical areas and in areas adjacent to major metropolitan regions such as New York Chicago and Los Angeles in conjunction with other studies to be conducted as part of the Coastal and Marine Program Over the long term standard paper and electronic products from these surveys will provide systematic coverage of the coast and shelf to issue based investigations and to cooperating agencies Present Regions of Study NY NJ West Florida Los Angeles Santa Monica Regions of Future Interest Future regions of the EEZ mapped by the program will be linked directly to Studies initiated under the first three Themes The effort under this Theme of the program will focus on assuring uniform products are developed in the different regions These areas include the Gulf of Maine Chesapeake Bay Chicago Great Lakes San Diego Long Beach Puget Sound Alaska Fisheries Biologic Habitats Hawaii 2 Coastal and Marine Information Bank Scope One of the purposes of the Coastal and Marine Geology Program is to develop and maintain a comprehensive understanding of the marine geology of the Nation s coastal and offshore Federal lands for public benefit This information must be easily available in a variety of forms to the Federal and state governments the public industry and the scientific community to facilitate the wise management and sustainable use of the Nation s marine realms Development of an Information Bank is therefore a priority component of the Program and appropriate to the mission of the USGS The Bank includes physical archives and electronic media to facilitate access to stored data and information Objectives The primary objectives of the Marine and Coastal Information Bank Subtheme are to provide the best possible comprehensive geologic information about the Nation s marine realms making it easily and rapidly available to others in understandable forms facilitate interaction and information exchange within the USGS and with other agencies institutions and the public archive samples data and information produced by Program studies facilitate assessments of the state of understanding of the marine realms which will guide future research and mapping activities understand consumer needs and requirements regarding the use of Coastal and Marine Geology Program products and evaluate the role of marine science in policy decision making Setting priorities The operation of the USGS Coastal and Marine Information Bank will require the development of technical capabilities for data rescue and continued maintenance of the Information Bank Collaboration with current USGS data efforts NMD GIS programs and standards will be undertaken in concert with data programs in other federal agencies The information will be made available in a variety of forms and is the basis for a range of educational activities Subtheme Components TECHNICAL CAPABILITIES AND STANDARDS Information in the Bank will be maintained and distributed electronically backed by physical archives of samples paper records and electronic media A marine information network linking the three marine centers and available to others over the Internet will be maintained Standards for digital data storage and for metadata documentation and retrieval will be developed in consultation with interagency organizations so that all newly produced or rescued program data can be archived in widely accessible formats and can be located and retrieved across the Internet Other agencies and Institutions will be encouraged to add to the Information Bank in areas of interest to the Program COMPREHENSIVE AND READILY USABLE INFORMATION BANK An information management system will be established to support the information activities of the investigations undertaken by the Coastal and Marine Geology Program The system will aid in the acquisition verification analysis synthesis and interpretation of the information produced and used in these studies capture the results of the studies and integrate them into the Information Bank catalog and archive all supporting data provide search retrieval and distribution capabilities Develop an industry partnership for a national data bank Create a program wide GIS capability to synthesize banked data Maintain an Antarctic seismic library in cooperation with NSF and SCAR The Information Bank will include catalogs of USGS digital and analog data holdings reconnaissance images of the EEZ sea floor GLORIA and other surveys geophysical data including multi channel gravity magnetic and digital high resolution seismics coastlines bathymetry sediment texture sediment chemistry time series data of ocean bottom currents bottom photographs and selected publications of the USGS Data will be principally digital however the Information Bank will also include samples and analog observations Digital data archiving and rescue These projects will focus on existing but neglected digital data to archive and store those portions deemed valuable to future Program needs and to unanticipated needs by future investigators Sample archiving and rescue The Program holds valuable marine and coastal samples photographs paper records and cores that lack curation and archiving information and thus are of little use to the public or to future USGS staff use yet are a valuable legacy and history of the nations marine realm The project will organize and curate the sample repositories Appropriate metadata will be transmitted to NGDC as part of our commitment to the international scientific community and then placed on the WWW for access by the public USGS research staff and other scientists OUTREACH The wise stewardship of the Nation s marine and coastal areas depends on an informed public Educational outreach and training materials information sheets documentaries CD ROMS displays and activities seminars conferences classroom participation will provide information about Coastal and Marine issues to a wide range of audiences 3 Assessments and Evaluation of the Information Bank Scope The comprehensive integrated body of knowledge available through the Information Bank will be used to perform assessments that evaluate the state of knowledge about the coastal and marine geology or provide an overview or synthesis of selected aspects of the marine realms Initially these assessments will be evaluations of the completeness of the Information Bank itself Objectives As the Information Bank grows the primary objectives of the Assessments and Evaluation Subtheme will be to provide national summaries of the adequacy of our scientific understanding to meet the needs of the Nation s government and commercial interests highlighting critical problems and areas for further study the completeness and consistency of our scientific understanding of the geology and sea floor environment of a region highlighting problems and areas for fundamental studies the extent of available resources or of environmental problems Setting Priorities The Information Bank will provide the means for regular periodic assessments of the state of information about the Nation s marine realms for judging its relevance to national needs and ability to address gaps in understanding and for redirecting survey and research efforts to meet needs and fill gaps Assessments provide a place for a larger often national reviews and synthesis that cannot be carried out as part of regional studies provide assurance that regional studies relate to a national view of specific issues and provide a way to add to the Program Information Bank As such much of the data for these assessments will be embedded in Themes 1 2 and 3 Topics of Present Interest Contaminated sediments National Coastal Assessment processes and stability Geologic environments of estuaries 4 Technology and Facilities Scope Marine and coastal geologic investigations require a broad range of specialized platforms and equipment Research vessels ranging from shallow draft coastal vessels to ocean going ships provide major support for field investigations Specialized equipment includes acoustic and optical systems to image the sea floor seismic systems to map the subsurface instruments to measure currents and oceanographic parameters a broad range of sampling systems and laboratory facilities Instruments for geologic and sedimentologic parameters along the coast and offshore become ever more sophisticated and productive For example new swath mapping systems have greatly improved the ability to conduct reconnaissance surveys of shallow water regions in a cost effective way Remote sensing data collected from aircraft or satellites provide another important source of information to many investigations Objectives The objective of the Technology and Facilities subtheme is to obtain develop and maintain the scientific equipment vessels and technical facilities needed to conduct the investigations of the Coastal and Marine Geology Program Setting Priorities High priority items are those which are critical to a number of investigations of the Coastal and Marine Geology Program In general most acquisitions are borne by the individual studies that require them The equipment maintained by the USGS Coastal and Marine Geology Program benefits the entire marine science community and is often used as a National Facility by other researchers cooperating with the USGS Subtheme Components VESSEL CAPABILITIES As field studies are a primary component of most of the investigations in this plan the daily cost of operating maintaining and or leasing vessels such as the UNOLS platforms is included in the individual budgets of the investigations Upgrades or common vessel equipment provide basic support for many studies Areas of Program Interest Coastal Vessels R V Worthy SWATH Vessel SCIENTIFIC EQUIPMENT Advanced hardware and software are essential to obtain and process sea floor observations and to produce data products efficiently and rapidly The USGS has recently acquired new software and workstations that allow field and laboratory data to be processed in near real time The digital data and mosaics similar to aerial photographs are distributed on CD ROM and are overlain with other data such as tectonics stratigraphy sediment texture contaminant levels habitats and sediment pathways This component focuses on the maintenance upgrading and expansion of facilities and field and operational instruments and laboratory equipment with emphasis on supporting the needs of multiple projects Priorities will be determined justified and understood in the context of science and project priorities Areas of Program Interest Mapping Coastal and sea floor mapping
