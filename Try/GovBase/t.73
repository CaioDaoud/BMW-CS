2001 The Extreme Ultraviolet Explorer EUVE was a NASA funded astronomy mission operating in the relatively unexplored extreme ultraviolet 70 760 Angstroms in wavelength equivalent to 0 016 0 163 keV in energy bandpass The science payload which was designed and built at the Space Sciences Laboratory at the University of California Berkeley under the direction of Dr Roger F Malina consisted of three grazing incidence scanning telescopes and an extreme ultraviolet EUV spectrometer deep survey instrument The science payload was attached to a Multi Mission Modular spacecraft The EUVE mission was launched on June 7 1992 on a Delta II rocket from Cape Canaveral The first six months of the mission were dedicated to mapping the EUV sky with the scanning telescopes Subsequent to that the mission carried out its Guest Observer phase The science goals of EUVE were to i carry out an all sky all band survey in the extreme ultraviolet 70 760 A in four bandpasses with an angular resolution of 6 x 6 arc minutes and 500 seconds average exposure ii carry out a deep survey in the EUV in two bandpasses along the ecliptic iii carry out pointed spectroscopy observations of targets identified by Guest Observers iv identify the emission physics of EUV sources such as hot white dwarfs and late type coronal stars v study the interstellar medium and vi probe whether compelling science could be done with increased sensitivity in the EUV Late in 1997 NASA decided that the EUVE final data archive responsibilities should be transferred from the Center for Extreme Ultraviolet Astrophysics CEA to the HEASARC the Space Telescope Science Institute STScI and the National Space Sciences Data Center NSSDC The role of the HEASARC is to serve the publically available EUVE data and to act as an interface to the community of high energy X ray and gamma ray astrophysicists while that of the STScI is to provide similar access to the optical and UV community as well as to maintain the EUVE IRAF based software package The role of the the NSSDC is that of a deep archive for the EUVE data and the servicing of requests for large amounts of EUVE data i e for data volumes that are infeasible to retrieve over the Internet WWW EUVE artists conception Latest News docs euve ehp whatsnew html EUVE REENTERED EARTH S ATMOSPHERE ON 2002 JAN 30TH 23 15 EST The HEASARC Public Archive of EUVE pointing mode spectroscopic observations is now complete The Center for EUV Astronomy CEA closed in March 2001 A report on the results of the final EUVE calibration observations is now available EUVE Mission Operations were terminated in January 2001 docs euve ehp whatsnew html More News In the summer of 2000 NASA decided that EUVE mission operations should cease within a few months EUVE science operations ended on January 26 2001 and there followed several days of end of life mission engineering tests of the never used backup high voltage supplies and checking of the remaining battery capacity EUVE was stabilized pointing away from the Sun and sent into safehold at 23 59 UTC on Jan 31 2001 The transmitters were finally commanded off on Feb 2 2001 EUVE was left in a 424 x 433 km x 28 4 deg orbit which slowly decayed until it finally re entered the Earth s atmosphere and was destroyed on Jan 30 2002 almost exactly one year after it ended science operations On March 27 2001 the
