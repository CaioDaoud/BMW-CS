performance as other employees The Civil Rights Act of 1991 The Civil Rights Act of 1991 made major changes in the federal laws against employment discrimination enforced by EEOC Enacted in part to

notified that the charge has been filed From this point there are a number of ways a charge may be handled A charge may be assigned for priority investigation if the initial facts appear to support a violation of law When the evidence is less strong the charge may be assigned for follow up investigation to determine whether it is likely that a violation has occurred EEOC can seek to settle a charge at any stage of the investigation if the charging party and the employer express an interest in doing so If settlement efforts are not successful the investigation continues In investigating a charge EEOC may make written requests for information interview people review documents and as needed visit the facility where the alleged discrimination occurred When the investigation is complete EEOC will discuss the evidence with the charging party or employer as appropriate The charge may be selected for EEOC s mediation program if both the charging party and the employer express an interest in this option Mediation is offered as an alternative to a lengthy investigation Participation in the mediation program is confidential voluntary and requires consent from both charging party and employer If mediation is unsuccessful the charge is returned for investigation A charge may be dismissed at any point if in the agency s best judgment further investigation will not establish a violation of the law A charge may be dismissed at the time it is filed if an initial in depth interview does not produce evidence to support the claim When a charge is dismissed a notice is issued in

EEOC nor the charging party may go to court unless the conciliation mediation or settlement agreement is not honored If EEOC is unable to successfully conciliate the case the agency will decide whether to bring suit in federal court If EEOC decides not to sue it will issue a notice closing the case and giving the charging party 90 days in which to file a lawsuit on his or her own behalf In
