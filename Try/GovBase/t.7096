honors pioneering scientific research that has enhanced our basic understanding of life and the world around us The National Medal of Technology recognizes the achievements of men and women who embody the spirit of American innovation and have enhanced the nation s global competitiveness Both these medals are authorized by acts of Congress They re the highest honors the President can bestow for attainment in science and technology The men and women we honor today probably didn t begin their careers with the expectation of receiving such honors Most great achievers in the fields of science and technology have a sense of calling They re drawn to the work by their curiosity and by their talent They carry out their work with patient effort and the openness to truth that leads to discovery The highest reward for their work is the good they do and the knowledge they leave behind The medals we confer today are a way of expressing our own gratitude to some of the most gifted and visionary men and women in America The men and women are helping to enhance the nation s health and economic prosperity They ve made their contributions to progress in a variety of fields from physics to genetics to mathematical theory to engineering to the development of the semiconductors Some of them have made achievements beyond their own fields of endeavor thereby showing the great potential of interdisciplinary research Each of these recipients has set a standard of excellence Each is widely admired by peers and sets a fine example for the next generation of scientists mathematicians and engineers And all of them represent the finest qualities of their professions and the finest qualities of our country This great nation provides opportunities and institutions that make achievement possible We ve got a vibrant free enterprise system we ve got the world s finest universities and generous support for scientific and technological endeavor Yet all the great achievements we honor today are the sum of individual effort And when we speak of American creativity and American ingenuity we re speaking of men and women like our National Laureates of Science and Technology They have freely accepted the toil of overcoming challenges They have put their considerable gifts to good purpose Their fellow Americans are grateful to them all humanity is in your debt And now I ask the military aide to read the citations It s my honor to present the medals to the National Laureates of Science and Technology The medals are presented Applause END 3 20 P M EST news releases 2003 11
