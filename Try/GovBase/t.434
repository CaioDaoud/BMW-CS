Microsoft Word 73 1 Chapter 1 of Ice Ages and Astronomical Causes 12Gbyte Applications Microsoft Office 98 Templates Web Pages Blank Web Page brief introduction to the history of climate Beginning in the early 1900s the climate of the world began to warm This is evident in Figure 1 1 which shows the average Earth surface temperature from 1880 through 1999 The temperature is an area weighted average over the land and ocean compiled by the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration using an averaging technique devised by Quayle et al see also In the plot zero temperature is defined as the temperature in 1950 The fine line shows the monthly temperatures the thicker line shows the 12 month yearly averages The figure shows that the 20th century had a temperature rise of nearly one degree Celsius That may not sound like a lot but its effects are quite noticeable In Europe the great glaciers of the Alps such as the Mer de Glace near Chamonix have been in retreat and the canals of Holland almost never freeze over as they did in an earlier era to allow Hans Brinker to silver skate into legend The effects elsewhere on the globe are more severe with large areas of Central Africa once fertile becoming arid and no longer capable of supporting a large population Although the reason for this warming is not fully understood many climate scientists think it is the result of the addition of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases into the atmosphere by humans Figure 1 1 Global warming As we go back in time in search of earlier records the historical record becomes less reliable Fortunately Nature has provided its own recording mechanism As we will explain in Chapter 4 measurements of oxygen isotopes yield an estimate of ancient temperatures combined with total global ice volume a combination which is just as interesting as temperature alone if not more so Data from a kilometer long core taken from the Greenland glacier as part of the Greenland Ice Sheet Project GISP2 are shown in Figure 1 2 For comparison purposes the zero of temperature scale for this plot was set to match that of the previous plot For historical interest we marked some events from European history Figure 1 2 Climate of the last 2400 years The cool period preceding the 20th century warming is now seen as a dip that lasted 700 years This period is now referred to as the little ice age The coldest periods near 1400 and 1700 are sometimes called the two little ice ages In her popular account of the history of the 14th century historian Barbara W Tuchman argues that the low temperatures triggered social conflict and poor food production and was thus responsible for hunger war and possibly even pestilence Just a few centuries prior at the beginning of the second millennium Europe had experienced the medieval warm period It was a time when civilization emerged from the Dark Ages art and painting flourished and the wealth and new productivity of Europe allowed it to build the great cathedrals Some historians will attribute this flowering to great leaders or to great ideas or to great inventions but it is foolish to ignore the changes in climate Just prior to that in the 900s the Vikings were invading France possibly driven from the more northern latitudes by the cold temperatures of that century The height of the Roman republic and empire was reached during another time of unusual warmth even higher than the warm period of today if the ice reckoned temperature scale is accurate The next plot Figure 1 3 shows the data from the Greenland ice core back to 10 000 BC Near the right hand side of this plot the little dip of the little ice age is clear Some scientists argue that global warming is not human caused but is simply a natural return to the normal temperature of the previous 8 000 years In fact no one knows for sure if this is right or not But the foundation for thinking that human effects will cause warming is substantial Even if the recent rise in temperature is natural human caused effects have a high probability of dominating in the near future and within our lifetimes the temperature of the Earth could go higher than has ever seen previously by Homo sapiens Figure 1 3 Climate of the last 12 000 years The dip near 6000 BC is not understood It actually appears to be coincident with a short term increase in temperature that took place in Antarctica So we can t easily interpret everything in these plots at least not without studying other records Fluctuations are evident all over the plot and crying to be understood Agriculture began about 7 000 BCE as marked on the plot All of civilization was based on this invention Agriculture allows large groups of people to live in the same location It allows a small number of people to feed others so that the others can become craftsmen artists historians inventors and scientists The sudden rise at the left side of the plot at about 9 000 BCE i e 11 000 years ago was the end of the last ice age The abruptness of the termination is startling Agriculture and all of our civilization developed since this termination The enormous glacier several kilometers thick covering much of North America and Eurasia rapidly melted Only small parts of this glacier survived in Greenland and Antarctica where they exist to this day The melting caused a series of worldwide floods unlike anything previously experienced by Homo sapiens There had been a previous flood at about 120 kyr but that was before Homo sapiens had moved to Europe or North America The flood dumped enough water into the oceans to cause the average sea level to rise 110 meters enough to inundate the coastal areas and to cover the Bering Isthmus and turn it into the Bering Strait The water from melting ice probably flooded down over land in pulses as ice dammed lakes formed and then catastrophically released their water These floods left many records including remnant puddles now known as the Great Lakes and possibly gave rise to legends that persisted for many years As the glacier retreated it left a piles of debris at its extremum One such pile is now known as New York s Long Island In the next plot Figure 1 4 we show the Greenland ice data for the last 100 000 years The very unusual nature of the last 11 000 years stands out in striking contrast to the 90 000 years of cold that preceded it We now refer to such an unusual warm period as an interglacial The long preceding period of ice is a glacial During the last glacial humans developed elaborate tools and Homo sapiens migrated from Africa to Europe But they did not develop civilization until the ice age ended During the glacial not only was the temperature lower by 8 Celsius and some estimates put it at more than 12 Celsius the record is a superposition of ice volume and temperature but the climate was extremely irregular The irregularities in temperature during the glacials the wild bumps and wiggles that cover much of Figure 1 4 are real not an artifact of poor measurement The same bumps and wiggles are seen in two separate cores in Greenland and in data taken from sea floor records found off the California coast The ability to adapt quickly during this wild climate ride may have given a substantial advantage to adaptable animals such as humans and made it difficult for other large fauna to survive Maybe it was these rapid changes and not the rapaciousness of humans that drove the mammoths camels giant ground sloths and giant beavers the size of bears of North America extinct Recent global warming appears negligible on this plot However if predictions of climate modelers are correct global warming temperature changes will be comparable those during the ice age Figure 1 4 Climate of the last 100 000 years The reliable data from Greenland go back only as far as shown in Figure 1 4 We can continue the climate plot further back by using the records from Vostok the Russian base in Antarctica where another ice core was drilled The last 420 thousand years of a deuterium measurement at Vostok is shown in Figure 1 5 with the most recent 100 kyr appended from the Greenland record which is more detailed The temperature scale was adjusted to agree with the scale on the Greenland record Figure 1 5 Climate for the last 420 kyr from Vostok ice From this plot it is clear that most of the last 420 thousand years 420 kyr was spent in ice age The brief periods when the record peaks above the zero line the interglacials typically lasted from a few thousand to perhaps twenty thousand years These data should frighten you All of civilization developed during the last interglacial and the data show that such interglacials are very brief Our time looks about up Data such as these are what led us to state in the Preface that the next ice age is about to hit us any millennium now It does not take a detailed theory to make this prediction We don t necessarily know why the next ice age is imminent at least on a geological time scale but the pattern is unmistakable The real reason to be frightened is that we really don t understand what causes the pattern We don t know why the ice ages are broken by the short interglacials We do know something that the driving force is astronomical We ll describe how we know that in Chapter 2 We have models that relate the astronomical mechanisms to changes in climate but we don t know which of our models are right or if any of them are We will discuss these models in some detail in this book Much of the work of understanding lies in the future It is a great field for a young student to enter The ice records take us back only to 420 000 years in the past However oxygen isotope records in sea floor cores allow us to go further One of the best sets of data comes from a location in the northern Atlantic Ocean known as the Ocean Drilling Project Site 607 This site has climate data going back three million years and is shown in Figure 1 6 But before you look at the figure let us warn you In the paleoclimate community there is a convention that time is shown backwards That is the present is plotted on the left hand edge and the past is towards the right We are going to use this opportunity to change our convention for the remainder of the book so that you will have less trouble reading the literature The literature of global warming scientists in contrast follows the other convention which we have used up until now We apologize for this change in convention but we do not take blame for it In Figure 1 6 the 10 kyr years of agriculture and civilization appear as a sudden rise in temperature barely visible squeezed against the left hand axis of the plot The temperature of 1950 is indicated by the horizontal line As is evident from the data civilization was created in an unusual time There are several important features to notice in these data all of which will be discussed further in the remainder of the book For the last million years or so the left most third of the plot the oscillations have had a cycle of about 100 kyr thousand years That is the enduring period of ice is broken roughly every 100 kyr by a brief interglacial During this time the terminations of the ice ages appear to be particularly abrupt as you can see from the sudden jumps that took place near 0 120 320 450 and 650 thousand years ago This has led scientists to characterize the data as shaped like a sawtooth although the pattern is not perfectly regular Figure 1 6 Climate of the last 3 million years But as we look back beyond a 1000 kyr 1 million years the character changes completely The cycle is much shorter it averages 41 kyr the amplitude is reduced the average value is higher indicating that the ice ages were not as intense and there is no evidence for the sawtooth shape These are the features that ice age theories endeavor to explain Why did the transition take place What are the meanings of the frequencies We will show that they are well known astronomical frequencies In the period immediately preceding the data shown here older than 3 million years the temperature didn t drop below the 1950 value and we believe that large glaciers didn t form perhaps only small ones such as we have today in Greenland and Antarctica As we end this brief introduction to the history of the ice ages let s again look to the future As soon as the cycle of the ice ages was known scientists realized that the ice age would eventually return Some of them enjoyed scaring the public about the impending catastrophe In Figure 1 7 we show the cover from a magazine of the 1940s showing the consequences of the return of the ice age to New York City One of the authors of the present book RAM saw this image as a child and it made a lasting impression Unfortunately the art genre of returning ice has been superceded in the public forum by paintings of asteroids about to hit the Earth usually with a curious dinosaur momentarily distracted by the unusual scene But as we mentioned earlier the more likely scenario for the early 21st century is the continued gradual growth of global warming Figure 1 7 The Ice Age returns to New York City You may continue in Chapter 1 to read IceAgeTheories html A Brief Introduction to Ice Age Theories or Spectra html A Brief Introduction
