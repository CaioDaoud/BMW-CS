planned implemented and operated transit guideway capital investments From heavy to light rail from commuter rail to bus rapid transit systems the New Starts program has helped to make possible hundreds of new or extended transit fixed guideway systems across the country These rail and bus investments in turn have improved the mobility of millions of Americans have helped to reduce congestion and improve air quality in the areas they serve and have fostered the development of viable safer and more livable communities The http www fhwa dot gov tea21 Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century TEA 21 has authorized 8 2 billion in New Starts funding through fiscal year 2003 An even higher level of funding is anticipated in the next Federal surface transportation authorization beginning in 2004 While the level of New Starts funding has never been higher neither has the demand for it TEA 21 authorizes over 190 projects nationwide to compete for these discretionary Federal dollars Many of these projects are currently in FTA s New Starts http www fta dot gov library policy ns pepipe html pipeline that is projects pursuing New Starts funding which are in the preliminary or final design stages of development TEA 21 directs FTA to evaluate and rate candidate New Starts projects as an input to Federal funding decisions and at specific milestones throughout each project s planning and development TEA 21 further establishes a comprehensive B planning and project development process which New Starts projects must follow and which is intended to assist local agencies and decisionmakers evaluate alternative strategies for addressing transportation problems in specified corridors and select the most appropriate improvement to advance into engineering design and construction Planning and project development for New Starts projects is a continuum of analytical activities carried out as part of the http www fta dot gov office planning mswp index html metropolitan planning and http www fta dot gov office planning ep index html National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 NEPA review processes FTA has published a http www fta dot gov library legal fr12700 html Final Rule on Major Capital Investment Projects which outlines these New Starts requirements a series of FAQs on the Final Rule is available http www fta dot gov library policy ns 2001 plfaqs nsfrfaqs html here FTA has also issued preliminary Guidance on amtireport cover html Advancing Major Transit Investments Through Planning and Project Development which provides additional detail on the project development and evaluation processes for fixed guideway transit projects seeking New Starts funding The following narrative summarizes the planning development and funding of New Starts projects The following describes the planning project development evaluation and budget recommendation processes for fixed guideway transit projects seeking New Starts funding Please mailto planningmailbox fta dot gov contact us if you have any comments or suggestions on how to improve this site New Starts Criteria TEA 21 identifies several specific New Starts criteria which the Federal Transit Administration must consider in its approval to advance transit fixed guideway projects through the project development process and enter into a long term financial commitment to implement the proposed investments The Act categorizes these criteria into three broad areas G Alternatives Analysis and H Preliminary Engineering Along with I Final Design these activities constitute the planning and project development process for New Starts investments All projects seeking discretionary New Starts funding must follow this process and FTA must approve project entrance into all but the alternatives analysis phase of planning and development The planning and project development process is the forum for the development and refinement of the project justification and local financial commitment New Starts criteria see below and for addressing other planning environmental engineering and design issues and requirements C Project Justification TEA 21 requires that proposed New Starts projects be justified based on several project justification criteria including the following Mobility Improvements Environmental Benefits Operating Efficiencies Cost Effectiveness and Other Factors Because of its important role in contributing to the success of fixed guideway transit systems TEA 21 further encourages the consideration of Transit Supportive Land Use and Future Patterns FTA has added this consideration as an additional project justification criteria D Local Financial Commitment TEA 21 requires that New Starts project sponsors demonstrate adequate local support for the project as measured by The proposed share of total project costs from sources other than from the New Starts program including Federal formula and flexible funds and state and local funding The strength of the proposed project s capital financing plan and The ability of the sponsoring agency to fund operation and maintenance of the entire system as planned once the guideway project is built Planning and Project Development Process for New Starts Projects Projects seeking New Starts funding like all Federally funded transportation investments in metropolitan areas must emerge from a locally driven multimodal corridor planning process as depicted graphically below teald htm v There are three key phases in the planning and project development process for projects seeking New Starts funding 1 Alternatives Analysis 2 Preliminary Engineering and 3 Final Design These phases are described below Alternatives Analysis To specifically qualify for Section 5309 New Starts funding candidate projects must have resulted from an alternatives analysis also known as major investment study or multimodal corridor analysis study which evaluates appropriate modal and alignment options for addressing mobility needs in a given corridor Alternatives analysis can be viewed as a bridge between systems planning which identifies regional travel patterns and transportation corridors in need of improvements and project development where a project s design is refined sufficiently to complete the NEPA environmental process The alternatives analysis study is intended to provide information to local officials on the benefits costs and impacts of alternative transportation investments developed to address the purpose and need for an improvement in the corridor Potential local funding sources for implementing and operating the alternatives should be identified and studied and New Starts criteria should be developed At local discretion the alternatives analysis may include the undertaking of a Draft Environmental Impact Statement DEIS Involvement of a wide range of stakeholders including the general public in the alternative analysis study process is strongly encouraged Alternatives analysis is considered complete when a locally preferred alternative LPA is selected by local and regional decisionmakers and adopted by the metropolitan planning organization MPO into the financially constrained metropolitan transportation plan At this point the local project sponsor may submit to FTA the LPA s New Starts project justification and local financial commitment criteria and request FTA s approval to enter into the preliminary engineering phase of project development FTA is in the process of updating its Technical Methods for Transit Project Planning which provides detailed technical guidance on the alternatives analysis study process Several Updated Chapters are available library policy ns chapters here The original guidance with these library policy ns chapters chapter updates is available by mail from the FTA Office of Planning click mailto planningmailbox fta dot gov here to request a copy FTA requests the opportunity to review the alternatives analysis study s scope of work purpose and need description of alternatives and technical methodologies and results as they are developed FTA desires to become involved in these local studies to assist agencies in addressing technical and procedural issues early in the study process rather than at the end when it may be too late to efficiently solve them and to gain sufficient understanding of the resulting project to support FTA s decision to advance it into preliminary engineering and later final design Preliminary Engineering During the preliminary engineering phase of project development local project sponsors refine the design of the proposal taking into consideration all reasonable design alternatives Preliminary engineering results in estimates of project costs benefits and impacts at a level of detail necessary to complete the NEPA process The proposed project s New Starts criteria are similarly refined in the preliminary engineering phase of development project management plans are updated and local funding sources are committed to the project if not previously committed FTA typically assigns http www fta dot gov office program pmo htm project management oversight contractors to projects undergoing PE to ensure that the engineering effort progresses in accordance with FTA requirements and that the project sponsor is adequately preparing for the final design stage of development Preliminary engineering for a New Starts project is considered complete when FTA has issued a Record of Decision ROD or Finding of No Significant Impact FONSI as required by NEPA Projects which complete preliminary engineering and whose sponsors are determined by FTA to have the technical capability to advance further in the project development process must request FTA approval to enter final design and submit updated New Starts criteria for evaluation Final Design Final design is the last phase of project development and includes right of way acquisition utility relocation and the preparation of final construction plans including construction management plans detailed specifications construction cost estimates and bid documents The project s financial plan is finalized and a plan for the collection and analysis of data needed to undertake a library policy ns bandaqanda htm Before and After Study which is required of all projects seeking an FFGA is developed Project Justification TEA 21 s project justification criteria are intended to reflect the broad range of benefits and impacts which may be realized by the implementation of the proposed New Starts transit investment Project justification criteria are initially developed as part of alternatives analysis and are refined throughout the preliminary engineering and final design phases of project development FTA periodically issues guidance on the http www fta dot gov library policy ns 2002 calculation of project justification measures FTA s New Starts project justification criteria and the current measures which make up each criteria are summarized below Criteria Measure s Mobility Improvements Hours of Transportation System User Benefits Low Income Households Served Employment Near Stations Environmental Benefits Change in Regional Pollutant Emissions Change in Regional Energy Consumption EPA Air Quality Designation Operating Efficiencies Operating Cost per Passenger Mile Cost Effectiveness Incremental Cost per Hour of Transportation System User Benefit Transit Supportive Land Use and Future Patterns Existing Land Use Transit Supportive Plans and Policies Performance and Impacts of Policies Other Land Use Considerations Other Factors Project benefits not reflected by other New Starts criteria Local Financial Commitment The local financial commitment criterion is intended to reflect the level of local funding proposed for the project and the extent to which this local funding is dedicated to and in place for the proposed investment This criterion also addresses the reasonableness of project cost estimates and revenue forecasts the adequacy of provisions to address unanticipated costs and funding shortfalls the financial condition of the New Start project sponsor and how the sponsor will ensure the operation and maintenance of its entire transit system after implementation of the proposed fixed guideway system Like the project justification criteria information which supports the local financial commitment criteria is refined throughout the planning and project development process Guidance on the development of library policy ns tfp htm transit financial plans is available from FTA The three measures for local financial commitment include Criteria Measure s Local Financial Commitment Stability and Reliability of Capital Financing Plan Stability and Reliability of Operating Financing Plan Local Share of Project Costs New Starts Evaluation and Rating FTA evaluates and rates New Starts projects for several specific reasons To approve project entrance into preliminary engineering To approve project entrance into final design As an input to development of the Department s annual New Starts budget request FTA s ratings are included in the http www fta dot gov library policy ns ns2003 nscover html Annual Report on New Starts which is submitted to Congress each Spring To execute a full funding grant agreement FFGA In undertaking its evaluation TEA 21 requires that FTA rate each candidate New Starts project in preliminary engineering or final design as either Highly Recommended Recommended or Not Recommended These overall project ratings are based on ratings assigned by FTA to each of the project justification and local financial commitment criteria described above The graphic below summarizes FTA s evaluation and rating process nsrpld htm v The FTA New Starts Evaluation and Rating Process FTA assigns a rating of high medium high medium low medium or low to each of the individual project justification criteria and to the measures for local financial commitment These criteria measure specific ratings are then combined into summary project justification and finance ratings These summary ratings are in turn used to determine overall project ratings according to the following decision rule Highly Recommended Projects must be rated at least medium high for both finance and project justification Recommended Projects must be rated at least medium for both finance and project justification Not Recommended Projects not rated at least medium in both finance and justification will be rated as not recommended http www fta dot gov library policy ns nserp htm Additional information on FTA s process for evaluating New Starts projects is available here It is very important to emphasize that project evaluation is an on going process FTA evaluation and rating occurs annually in support of budget recommendations presented in the library policy ns ns2004 nscover html Annual Report on New Starts and when projects request FTA approval to enter into preliminary engineering or final design Consequently as proposed New Starts projects proceed through the project development process information concerning costs benefits and impacts is refined and the ratings updated to reflect new information FTA Budget Recommendations FTA s ratings are intended to reflect overall project merit proposed projects that are rated as recommended or highly recommended have demonstrated significant potential benefits and are therefore eligible for New Starts funding However a rating of recommended or highly recommended does not translate directly into a funding recommendation or commitment in any given year Rather FTA must also consider the amount of New Starts funding available on an annual basis and the phase of project development of candidate New Starts projects To be included in FTA s annual budget request proposed New Starts must also be sufficiently developed for consideration of a library policy 5200 1 intro html Federal full funding grant agreement FFGA FTA s funding mechanism for supporting the multi year capital needs of project construction The following general principles are applied when determining annual funding allocations among proposed New Starts projects The New Starts program is a capital program FTA budget recommendations therefore will be limited primarily to providing capital assistance Funding for alternatives analysis may be provided through FTA s Metropolitan Planning or Urbanized Area Formula Grants programs or through local sources New Starts funds should not be used for planning activities in support of alternatives analysis TEA 21 limits the amount of annual New Starts funding available for preliminary engineering at 8 percent of the total annual program Firm funding commitments embodied in FFGAs should not be made until the final design process has progressed to the point where estimated costs benefits and impacts are known with an extremely high degree of confidence FFGAs will not be entered into with projects in the preliminary engineering stage of development Existing FFGA commitments should be honored before any additional funding recommendations are made Therefore the amount of New Starts funding available for entering into new FFGAs in any given year is limited to the balance of the program remaining after fulfilling existing FFGA commitments The FFGA defines the terms of the Federal commitment to a specific project including funding Upon completion of an FFGA the Federal funding commitment has been fulfilled Additional project funding will not be recommended Any additional costs beyond the scope of the Federal commitment are the responsibility of the grantee http www fta dot gov library policy ns ns htm
