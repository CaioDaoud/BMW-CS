Instrument Development docs inst Gamma Ray and Cosmic Ray Gravitational Wave Astrophysics Branch docs gamcos X ray Astrophysics Branch docs xray The Laboratory for High Energy Astrophysics LHEA is recognized world wide as a center of excellence and leadership in cosmic ray X ray and gamma ray astrophysics With the recent addition of a Gravitational Wave Astrophysics group the LHEA is now ready to support the development of the LISA mission LHEA scientists working with GSFC engineers and technicians have pioneered state of the art instrumentation that has lead to many breakthrough discoveries The development of successful partnerships with the University community other government labs and international institutions has been a vital part of this success The LHEA astrophysicists study a wide range of exotic phenomenon including black holes neutron stars and white dwarfs supernova remnants gamma ray bursts coronae of nearby stars and the large scale structure of the Universe The LHEA also provides a substantial service role to support the community in science operations and data analysis This includes promoting and helping the community use of the data from missions associated with the labs programs This includes the High Energy Astrophysics Science Archive Research Center http heasarc gsfc nasa gov HEASARC which is responsible for archiving data from NASA s X ray and Gamma ray astronomy missions LHEA is one of three laboratories within the http space gsfc nasa gov Space Science Directorate at http www nasa gov NASA s http www gsfc nasa gov Goddard Space Flight Center An important function of the Directorate is to provide project scientist support to ensure the science that Goddard s Space Science Missions achieve their science goals The fact that the LHEA scientists are active scientists makes them well qualified to be project scientists and also to provide leadership in the development of new facilities for the future The LHEA has a very successful education and outreach program with many different types of material available including the very popular Astronomy Picture of the Day and Imagine the Universe Web sites Teachers and members of the general public are recommended to go to the docs learning html Education and Public Outreach area to find out more about high energy astrophysics LHEA Seminar Dec 8 Dr Curt Cutler
