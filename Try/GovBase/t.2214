Group Biomaterials Group The Biomaterials Group provides basic materials science engineering test methods and standards to sectors of the health care industry for the development of new or improved materials and delivery systems The work of the group focuses on 1 evaluation of synthetic materials biomaterials used to replace or restore function to a body tissue and 2 development of improved dental restorative materials with greater durability wear resistance and clinical acceptability clinic picture There is an overall risk of fractures of the hip spine and distal forearm that will afflict 40 of women and 13 of men 50 years of age and older Regenerating form and function to bone defects in an elderly osteoporotic population of Americans will be a daunting challenge To meet this challenge scientists from the Polymers Division are developing metrology methods to characterize the biocompatibility of bone grafts for bone regeneration Quantitative methods being developed include bioassays for the adhesion viability proliferation and alkaline phosphatase activity of bone cells as well as confocal microscopy and optical coherence tomography for measuring the growth of bone cells into bone grafts A combinatorial approach is being used to rapidly identify compositions and surface features of bone grafts that provide desirable properties such as biocompatibility and mechanical durability In addition members of the group work with other scientists from the Polymers Division to develop reference biomaterials and ancillary reference data that will be used by researchers and manufacturers to improve performance of human implantable devices such as hip and knee prostheses Polymer based dental composites are fast becoming the primary restorative material for the replacement of tooth structure that is lost through caries or trauma Although significant strides have been made in improving many of the properties of these multi phase materials they are still considered deficient with regard to their durability toughness and adhesion to contiguous tooth structure Because of the multi phase nature of composites polymer matrix plus filler plus interface problems also exist with regard to internal adhesion of these three phases Research efforts focus on improving our understanding of the synergistic interaction of these phases of the composite as well as elucidating the mechanisms of adhesion to dentin and enamel It is expected that these studies will provide a valuable knowledge base for the development of dramatically improved composites and adhesives A complimentary study is in progress to develop and understand the bioactivity of various types of calcium phosphate filled composites that exhibit remineralization potential graphic NIST
