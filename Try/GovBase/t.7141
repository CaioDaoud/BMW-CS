judge proceeding is court sponsored mediation A settlement judge is an administrative law judge familiar with the procedure and subject matter of Department of Labor adjudications and trained in alternative dispute resolution techniques The settlement judge is authorized to consult with the parties and assist them in resolving a dispute without the need for a formal administrative hearing Settlement judge conferences are off the record and are relatively informal in comparison to the normal hearing process which is similar to a trial The settlement judge adjusts his or her role to the circumstances of the case and may act as a moderator facilitator and intermediary The settlement judge will focus on realistically assessing the prospects of each side to the dispute the risks and costs of further litigation the interests of the parties and the benefits each side can gain through settlement The settlement judge may meet with counsel both together and separately Follow up conferences may be conducted Because settlement judges are also administrative law judges they likewise benefit from the provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act that protect ALJs from improper influences and ensure independence from the agency Thus settlement judges are strictly impartial and will not act as an advocate for any party although he or she will undoubtedly be a determined advocate for settlement of the case There is no guarantee however that a particular case will settle and a settlement judge will not attempt to force any party to settle Settlement judge proceeding are based on the voluntary participation of the parties If at any time a party concludes that he or she no longer wishes to pursue the settlement judge process the matter is referred back to the administrative law judge assigned to preside over the formal hearing The duration of the settlement judge s appointment is limited in order to prevent the settlement judge procedure from contributing to administrative delay and to ensure that a formal proceeding will follow forthwith if a settlement is not reached If the parties and the settlement judge agree that additional fruitful negotiations are possible however the settlement judge s appointment may be extended Bullet Is a fee charged for the settlement judge s services No The Department does not charge fees for the services of a settlement judge Bullet What cases are eligible Most types of cases heard by OALJ are eligible for a Settlement Judge conference Those that are not eligible or appropriate for ADR include black lung claims and appeals of denials of permanent alien labor certification In addition the Pension and Welfare Benefits Administration prefers to use its own highly successful internal ADR process in cases involving civil money penalties imposed pursuant to ERISA 502 c 2 and i Settlement judges are frequently used in areas such nuclear and environmental whistleblower complaints OFCCP actions and JTPA disputes In 1999 the procedure was extended for use in longshore workers compensation cases See sjlhcletter pdf Chief Judge s letter to Longshore bar PDF format Settlement judges are not available in longshore cases while the matter is still pending before OWCP Bullet Are settlement judge conferences confidential Although settlement judge conferences will be kept confidential to the extent possible participants should be aware that there are circumstances in which disclosure of information from a settlement judge conference may be required by operation of law or ordered by a court Confidential documents provided in settlement judge conferences are exempt from disclosure under FOIA See 5 U S C 574 j If a discovery request or other legal process is made on a settlement judge regarding a confidential communication made during the settlement judge conference the settlement judge will make reasonable efforts to notify the parties and any affected nonparty participants of the demand to provide them with an opportunity to defend a refusal of the settlement judge to disclose the requested information See 5 U S C 574 e Please note however that if the party or affected nonparty participant does not make an offer to defend they will be considered to have waived any objection to disclosure See 5 U S C 574 e The Department of Labor s settlement judge rule describes in part the limits of confidentiality at 29 C F R 18 9 e 8 Importantly under the Department of Labor rule the settlement judge is prohibited from discussing any aspect of the case with the presiding judge and no evidence regarding statements or conduct in the settlement judge proceedings will be admissible in the instant proceeding or any subsequent administrative proceeding before the Department except by stipulation of the parties For more explicit detail on the limits of confidentiality in administrative alternative dispute resolution programs however see this AFADRexcerpt htm excerpt from The Department of the Air Force s Mediation Guidance Handbook Parties concerned about limitations on confidentiality should take note that since the settlement judge program was established in 1993 no settlement judge has been the subject of a discovery request for confidential information concerning a settlement judge conference Bullet What happens if a settlement is reached If a settlement is reached the settlement will be treated as would any other case that is settled without of the services of settlement judge Department of Labor proceedings vary considerably in how settlements or consent findings are handled In addition the agreement of the parties itself may affect whether the settlement or consent findings must be submitted to the presiding ALJ Some whistleblower cases for example must be reviewed and approved by the presiding ALJ and or the Administrative Review Board before the case is dismissed from the adjudicatory docket In other types of cases the settlement may require the presiding judge to approve consent findings In still other types of cases it may be sufficient for the parties to simply stipulate to dismissal of the ALJ hearing The settlement judge should be able to assist the parties in determining on the requirements for reporting a settlement Bullet What happens if the parties are not able to settle the case If a settlement conference is unsuccessful or only partially successful the case is returned to the presiding administrative law judge without comment and the formal hearing process continues REFERENCES Horizontal Rule public
