inclusion in EPIC The XBT component of the data rescue effort has converted XBTs from xbts html 19 cruises to EPIC format None of the data that have been converted existed on the VAX in any format prior to the data rescue effort The XBTs that have been rescued were originally in three different formats SEAS III format on PC diskettes SEAS BATHY format on HP 85 cartridges and SEAS SUTRON format on HP 85 diskettes The general procedure for rescuing the data included 5 steps transferring the XBT data to the VAX entering the associated weather data into a VAX file converting the XBT casts and their corresponding weather information to EPIC format performing the data quality control and loading the acceptable casts into the EPIC data base A locally available http epic pmel noaa gov epic

improvements to the http www pmel noaa gov epic home html EPIC database system which is used as the central repository of XBT CTD time series and other types of data at PMEL The EPIC system includes data sets a data index graphics display and analysis routines documentation and maintenance utilities The data index was originally implemented using the relational data base management system RDBMS BOEING RIM As RIM is no longer maintained or supported by Boeing the data index is being reimplemented using Ingres and mSQL At the same time the Fortran routines used to load and maintain the data index are being simplified and made more portable through use of calls to EPSLIB New routines are being written in C PMEL logo http www pmel noaa gov pmelhome html PMEL home page mailto data rescue
