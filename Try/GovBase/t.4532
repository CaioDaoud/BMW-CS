fires fires html Fire Experiment Results a collection of actual test data for a range of commodities which may be found in residential and commercial applications These data include video and still pictures of the fires graphs of important measurements made during the testing and data which can be downloaded to run with the FAST or FASTLite software to simulate these burning items http www fire nist gov fire flamedata Diffusion Flame Measurements Profile data are presented here to aid research on the chemical structure of laminar hydrocarbon diffusion flames both for comparisons with other experimental results as well as for evaluating the predictions of flame models Specifically measurements made at NIST during the period 1984 1998 of species concentrations mole fraction temperatures K and velocities cm s are included for two diffusion flame systems fastdata FASTData FASTData is a collection over 450 tests ranging from cone calorimeter tests of single materials and assemblies to real scale tests of single and multiple compartment configurations Plots of data include focus on heat release rate but additional plots including temperatures species concentration mass loss and flows are included for some tests bfrlpubs testdata Industrial Sponsored Fire Test Data As a service to the fire safety community the National Institute of Standards and Technology NIST is making available reports and data that have been donated to NIST by the sponsoring organizations for wide spread use The contributions of these organizations to help advance fire safety are gratefully acknowledged fire sprink Residential Fire Sprinklers Two tests are presented that demonstrate how a fire is affected by a sprinkler http smokealarm nist gov Residential Smoke Alarms In cooperation with the United States Fire Administration U S Consumer Product Safety Commission and other sponsors NIST has evaluated current and emerging smoke alarm technology responses to common residential fire scenarios and nuisance alarm sources Data for more than 30 real scale tests are available and include the time varying concentrations of CO CO2 and O2 smoke obscuration and temperature at multiple locations in the structure The response of numerous smoke alarms place throughout the structures are also included fire wildland Fire Fighting Agents Fire experiment comparing treated and untreated
