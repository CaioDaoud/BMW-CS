IMMEDIATE RELEASE October 7 2003 Sandia seeks commercialization partners for hand held chemical analysis and detection system MicroChemLab device serves as homeland security tool for first line responders and offers variety of other applications ChemLab BD bio detection unit Sandia s ChemLab BD bio detection unit has successfully detected seven different forms of the biotoxin ricin and will undergo field testing this Fall Photo by Bud Pelletier http www sandia gov news center news releases 2003 images jpg chemlab in hand jpg Download 300dpi JPEG image chemlab in hand jpg 340K Media are welcome to download publish this image with related news stories LIVERMORE Calif Sandia National Laboratories has developed a series of compact hand held detection systems that place the capability of a fully functional chemistry laboratory at the fingertips of a trained field operator Sandia is actively soliciting industry partners to license manufacture and sell its ChemLab or MicroChemLab system Sandia s chemical analysis system which can rapidly detect and analyze toxic agents has been designed demonstrated and tested by Sandia researchers for several years While Sandia developed the systems for homeland security defense applications war fighters and first responders a variety of applications and near term commercialization opportunities exist in markets such as air and water quality medical diagnostics biotechnology and industrial process control The variations of the system are as follows ChemLab BD Bio Detection This liquid phase system discriminates proteins to detect and identify biotoxins viruses and bacterial agents The first generation of this system was taken to the Defense Science and Technology Laboratory at Porton Down England last year to test its ability to detect biotoxin variants It successfully detected seven different forms of ricin and could distinguish between two staphylococcal enterotoxin variants Results of the field trial influenced designs for the second generation prototype unveiled late last year The Gen II system has undergone extensive lab testing demonstrating nanomolar sensitivities and 10 minute analysis times Field tests are scheduled for this Fall The ChemLab BD will be on display at this week s MicroTAS 2003 conference at Squaw Valley Calif where Sandia s technical and business staff will be available to discuss system capabilities and partnership opportunities Information on MicroTAS 2003 can be found at http www microtas2003 org www microtas2003 org ChemLab CD Chemical Detection Two gas phase systems one hand held and one autonomous can be used for the detection of chemical warfare agents and a selection of toxic industrial chemicals explosives and organic solvents The hand held gas phase system has been tested with nerve and blister agents at Edgewood Chemical and Biological Center and at the Hazardous Spill Facility at the Nevada Test Site using simulants that have been explosively released In addition two of these hand held units have been delivered to the U S Army Soldier Biological and Chemical Command for testing Chem Lab Crew Sandia chemist Victoria Vandernoot and technologist Evelyn Cruz are two of the researchers who work on the ChemLab systems The gas phase systems can be used for the detection of chemical warfare agents and a selection of toxic industrial chemicals explosives and organic solvents Photo by Bud Pelletier http www sandia gov news center news releases 2003 images jpg chemlab crew jpg Download 300dpi JPEG image chemlab crew jpg 460K Media are welcome to download publish this image with related news stories A stationary gas phase system is currently deployed in the Boston subway system and has performed more than 100 000 tests with no false positive readings This autonomous system performs analyses every two minutes around the clock Companies with the technical capability and manufacturing capacity to produce ChemLab for government and commercial applications are encouraged to contact Sandia for information on licensing Explains Jill Micheau a business development associate at Sandia Our traditional government sponsors fund R D activities not product development or commercialization To assure that our ChemLab technologies successfully transition from the laboratory to the market we are seeking industry partners to provide capital and expertise Micheau said potential industry partners might help to further existing Sandia technologies develop real world products or manufacture market and service complete ChemLab systems or components These technologies may also be of interest to teams responding to the recent call for proposals by the Homeland Security Advanced Research Projects Agency HSARPA HSARPA which funds research and development in private industry is accepting proposals for Detection Systems for Biological and Chemical Countermeasures Information on the HSARPA announcement can be found at http www bids tswg gov wwww bids
