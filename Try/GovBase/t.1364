The mission of the Ceramics Divisionis to work with industry standards bodies universities and government laboratories in providing the leadership for the Nation s measurements and standards infrastructure for ceramic materials To this end the Ceramics Division conducts programs pertinent to measurement issues for ceramic materials through fundamental and applied research the development of standard test methodologies the preparation of standard reference materials and the evaluation and dissemination of standard reference data Ceramics Division Home http www ceramics nist gov http

UHMWPE Wear Particles Effects on Bioactivity ftp www ceramics nist gov NISTSP1002 pdf Ultra High Molecular Weigth Polyethylene Wear Particles Effects on Bioactivity NIST SP 1002 Ultra high molecular weight polyethylene UHMWPE wear particles have been recognized as one of the major causes of aseptic loosening in total joint replacements The goal of this study is to develop a technique for producing UHMWPE particles with specific sizes and shapes so as to be able to study the effects of different UHMWPE particles on bioactivity Download a ftp www ceramics nist gov NISTSP1002 pdf
