NCI which is part of the National Institutes of Health NIH NCI is located in a suburb of Washington DC DCEG scientists conduct an international program of population based studies to identify environmental and genetic determinants of cancer In carrying out its mission DCEG is at the cutting edge of approaches to unravel complex gene environment and gene gene interactions in cancer etiology Investigators at all levels of their careers work collaboratively to bring together the scientific disciplines needed to conduct these studies This environment is exciting and productive and presents extraordinary opportunities for young scientists who are launching their research careers Operating Philosophy The operation of the division s intramural research program is governed by its underlying research philosophy to serve as a national program for population based studies to identify environmental and genetic determinants of cancer Embedded in this philosophy are the following principles To maintain a broad based high quality intramural program of epidemiologic and interdisciplinary research that complements the research activities of the extramural community To sustain a centralized and collaborative program of epidemiologic research that has access to relevant populations and is poised to investigate natural experiments whenever and wherever they occur To maintain a national and international perspective giving priority to emergent cancer problems identified through clinical laboratory and epidemiologic observations as well as to public health concerns identified by Congress regulatory agencies and other appropriate bodies To allocate budget resources based upon the merit productivity and needs of organizational units and principal investigators the importance of the scientific opportunities and the balance and priority of research areas within the division To collaborate among organizational units within the division and across the NCI and the National Institutes of Health NIH to exploit fully the diverse expertise available with emphasis on etiologic studies that involve interactions with basic and clinical scientists and with prevention oriented programs To utilize contracts as an effective mechanism to collaborate with extramural investigators in accessing and studying relevant populations as well as to provide a means for deploying support staff for field work and maintaining core assets e g repositories and data bases To maintain vigorous interdisciplinary training programs in the principles and methods of epidemiology and in clinical molecular and quantitative genetics as they apply to the division s mission This philosophy is implemented by evaluating important and testable hypotheses for which there are appropriate populations or data resources The division is also continually on the alert for existing data resources that can be utilized or modified to help settle key epidemiologic and etiologic questions In addition attempts are made to identify critical but difficult issues that would benefit from interdisciplinary and or multicenter collaborations index html Home mailto dcegweb dceg2 cancer gov Contact http www nih gov
