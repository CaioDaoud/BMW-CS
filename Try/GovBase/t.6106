monitoring the density and vigor of green vegetation Useful applications of GVI products include classifying land cover estimating crop acreage and detecting plant stress The GVI products now online are weekly composites and have a resolution of about 16 km The NDVI Normalized Difference Vegetation Index FRV Fractional Vegetation and the BTD Precipitable Water Index products are now available A comprehensive description of GVI products my primary information source can be found at the National Climatic Data Center s http www2 ncdc noaa gov docs gviug NOAA GVI Guide line Normalized Difference Vegetation Index The basic index for measuring the greeness of the earth s surface is the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index NDVI which is basically a calculation of the differences between AVHRR channels 1 and 2 A reasonable estimation of the density and coverage of green vegetation can be determined by measuring how green the earth s surface is http www osdpd noaa gov PSB IMAGES NDVcoll map

gov PSB IMAGES GVIgifs NDVOC gif Oceania NDVI values range from 1 to 703 and are unitless Values greater than 1 generally denote increasing degrees in the greeness and intensity of vegetation Values between 0 and 1 are commonly characteristic of rocks and bare soil and values less than 0 sometimes indicate clouds rain and snow NOTE Low values of NDVI do not necessarily denote lack of vegetation For example during the winter months deciduous forests may appear more orange than green See the http www osdpd noaa gov PSB IMAGES ndvi arc html Normalized Difference Vegetation Index archive line Fractional Vegetation Fractional vegetation is essentially NDVI displayed as a fraction or a percentage if the fractional vegetation values are multiplied by 100 NDVI values less than or equal to 07 are set to 0 0 and NDVI values greater or equal to 57 are set to 1 0 NDVI values between 07 and 57 increase linearly from 0 0 to 1 0 as fractional vegetation http www osdpd noaa gov PSB IMAGES FRVcoll

the brightness temperature difference is the difference between AVHRR channels 4 and 5 PWI is a measurement of how much water vapor is in the atmosphere lower K values denote higher concentrations of water vapor Since AVHRR channels 4 and 5 are volume sampled from the top of the atmosphere to the surface PWI to an extent measures the total column precipitable water in the atmosphere Steve Olson
