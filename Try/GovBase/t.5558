Diet and Nutrition What is anemia Anemia is a process not a disease and is the most common disorder of the blood Anemia occurs when the amount of red blood cells or hemoglobin oxygen carrying protein in the blood in the blood becomes low causing the tissues of the body to be deprived of oxygen rich blood It is characterized by a reduction in size number or color of red blood cells RBC which results in reduced oxygen carrying capacity of the blood The blood of an anemic person has trouble carrying oxygen to tissues and organs in a sense become starved of oxygen and without oxygen the tissues cannot produce energy to function In order for the body to stay healthy organs and tissues need a steady supply of oxygen There are several kinds of anemia produced by a variety of underlying causes but the most common and most severe type of anemia iron deficiency anemia IDA Just as the name implies this form of anemia is due to insufficient iron In the United States 20 of all women of childbearing age have iron deficiency anemia compared with only 2 of adult men The principal cause of iron deficiency anemia in premenopausal women is blood lost during menses During their reproductive years women are at an increased risk for iron deficiency because they lose 20 40 mg or iron per month during the menstrual cycle Inadequate iron needs to be replenished through a well balanced diet Iron balance is maintained through the absorption mechanism of the gastrointestinal tract Other common causes of anemia include eating inadequate amounts of iron rich foods a deficiency of Vitamin B 12 a deficiency of folic acid or poor iron absorption by the body When the body has sufficient iron to meet its needs functional iron the remainder is stored for later use in the bone marrow liver and spleen Iron deficiency ranges from iron depletion which yields no physiological damage to iron deficiency anemia which can affect the function of numerous organ systems Iron depletion causes the amount of stored iron to be reduced but has no affect on the functional iron However a person with no stored iron has no reserves to use if the body requires more iron In essence the amount of iron absorbed by the body is not adequate for growth and development or to replace the amount lost Iron deficiency anemia is the final stage of iron deficiency What is the role of iron in the body Iron is responsible for the transport and storage of oxygen within working muscle cells including the heart Within each red blood cell are proteins called hemoglobin and embedded in each hemoglobin protein are four iron particles These iron particles give the red blood cell the ability to transport oxygen Iron binds to oxygen in the lungs and then circulates the oxygen rich blood to the tissues of the body Inadequate iron availability results in reduced production of red blood cells Consequently the red blood cells that do form are small with less hemoglobin and a decreased oxygen carrying capacity The total amount of iron in the body is dependent on intake loss and storage of the mineral How much iron does a woman need The body recycles iron so when a cell dies the iron is used to produce new cells Due to the body s efficient reuse of iron iron has a relatively small Recommended Daily Allowance RDA The RDA of iron for postmenopausal women is 10 milligrams women of childbearing age 11 50 years as well as nursing mothers require 15 milligrams and pregnant women 30 milligrams A multitude of national nutrition surveys report that as many as 90 of women do not consume enough iron Red blood cells are formed in the bone marrow where iron rich hemoglobin is accumulated Typically the heart pumps oxygen depleted blood to the lungs where hemoglobin of the red blood cells binds to oxygen and this oxygen rich blood circulates through the body to the tissues and organs The blood also brings carbon dioxide the waste product of the energy production process back to the lungs where it is exhaled from the body Red blood cells have a life time of 120 days and must constantly be replaced Since hemoglobin is the main component of red blood cells and the carrier for oxygen molecules anemia occurs when the hemoglobin supply is inadequate or if the hemoglobin is dysfunctional The initial stages of anemia normally presents no symptoms As the body s store of iron becomes exhausted or depleted so does the body s iron supply to the bone marrow diminishes A decrease in iron to the marrow hampers its ability to produce healthy red blood cells which require iron If iron stores do not become replenished full blown iron deficiency anemia develops It can take months or even years to develop symptoms of iron deficiency anemia symptoms include weakness paleness shortness of breath poor appetite and increased susceptibility to infection is evident If iron stores are re built symptoms will disappear Who is at risk for developing anemia An iron deficit is not necessarily due to poor eating habits an otherwise balanced diet may not supply ample iron to women in one of the following groups menstruating dieting pregnant vegetarian and women who do not eat red meat as well as women who have trouble absorbing iron from their foods Menstruation The monthly blood loss that occurs during menstruation causes the body to need increased iron Women who experience heavy bleeding should pay special attention to their iron intake Dieting Since the average American women s diet does not reach the RDA for iron dieting and decreasing food intake will make it even more difficult to reach the recommended RDA for iron Pregnancy Pregnant women are at an increased risk for developing anemia because the iron stores are placed at an increased demand caused by the higher blood volume and demands of the fetus and placenta Vegetarians Vegetarians and people who do not consume red meat are more apt to be iron deficient Meat sources of iron also called heme iron such pork beef and lamb are among the richest sources of iron Heme sources of iron are best absorbed and utilized by the body Non heme sources such as the iron in beans grains and vegetables is not nearly as well absorbed by the body Absorption The capacity of the body to absorb iron from the diet is a crucial factor for developing iron stores and maintaining functional iron When the body has trouble absorbing iron from foods or when iron is lost through cellular break down iron deficiency anemia is likely to occur How is anemia diagnosed Anemia is diagnosed by a blood test either by a fingerstick in a physician s office or by a blood test done in a laboratory What are the consequences of being anemic Mild anemia does not have any significant long term consequences However as the anemia becomes more severe there are medical problems which may arise The most serious of these involve the heart Severe anemia may cause a condition called high output heart failure where the heart must work harder to provide enough oxygen to the brain and other internal organs The heart beats faster and increases the amount of blood that is delivered per minute When this condition occurs in individuals that have existing heart disease the heart may be unable to keep up with this increased demand and symptoms of heart failure such as difficulty breathing and leg swelling may occur Individuals who have coronary artery disease or narrowing of the blood vessels supplying blood to the heart may develop symptoms of angina the pain associated with an insufficient blood flow to the heart muscle Depending on the age of the woman and the degree of coronary artery disease angina may develop with even mild anemia In severe cases the heart muscle may be permanently injured and the woman will be at increased risk for a heart attack How can developing anemia be prevented Iron deficiency anemia can be prevented by control of bleeding and restoration of adequate iron supplies by iron supplements Bleeding caused by uterine abnormalities such as fibroids is often controlled with the use of non steroidal anti inflammatory agents such as ibuprofen or naproxyn or oral contraceptives Mild bleeding from the gastrointestinal tract is controlled either by acid blocking agents which allow ulcers to heal or if the bleeding is from polyps in the colon by removal of the polyps If a person is treated for anemia what are the chances it will reoccur The answer to this question depends on the cause of the anemia If iron deficiency anemia is treated by stopping the source of the blood loss the anemia should resolve once the iron stores are repleted and should not reoccur unless another site of bleeding arises Pernicious anemia caused by B12 deficiency generally must be treated life long with B12 injections and will reoccur if the B12 treatment is stopped Inherited anemias such as thalassemia are lifelong conditions as well For More Information You can find out more about anemia by contacting
