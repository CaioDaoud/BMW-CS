html ISS Commercial Development NASA has supported scientific and commercial research in the life and microgravity sciences for approximately fifteen years beginning with the operation of the Space Shuttle fleet However the cumulative research time on board the Space Shuttles has been only about six months With the advent of the ISS researchers will have access to a space laboratory for periods of years with greater resources than any previous orbiting facility The ISS will provide greater research flexibility regular crew interaction with experiments and time for iterative or multi generational research The following shows the ongoing research funded by NASA during the first era of space research The ISS will usher in a new era and promises new scientific knowledge and economic
