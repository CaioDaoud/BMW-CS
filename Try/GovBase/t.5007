the relationship between harmful radiation from space and Earth s weakening magnetic field which acts as a shield against the radiation The magnetic field which has reversed polarity hundreds of times in the past has been declining in strength since instrumental records began tracking the field The last reversal of the field occurred about 700 000 years ago long before the era of satellites radio communications and the many technological mainstays that rely on Earth s magnetic shield The NOVA program has a Web site http www pbs org wgbh nova magnetic http www pbs org wgbh nova magnetic

Ted Scambos and Terry Haran were engaged in sea ice field work 11 September 30 October aboard the Australian research vessel Aurora Australis The objective of the work was to validate the AVHRR Polar Pathfinder ice surface temperature algorithm as part of the overall goal of the cruise to validate and calibrate a host of sea ice geophysical algorithms from Aqua Terra and earlier sensors Shipboard and airborne measurements were taken using a thermal radiometer while simultaneously downloading AVHRR images of the ship s region using a TerraScan system The data combined with shipboard meteorological data confirm the high accuracy of the algorithm over the 240 to 270 K range and indicate that skin temperatures can be markedly colder 10K lower than near surface air temperatures under

applications were David Douglas USGS Juneau AK and Bob Stone NOAA CIRES Boulder CO layout table Unprecedented Solar Activity Impacts Satellite Operations On November 4th the GOES Space Environment Monitor recorded an X28 flare This flare produced the largest flux of solar x rays ever recorded However since it occurred on the limb of the sun most of the high energy particles were aimed at right angles to the Earth so the earth was dealt only a glancing blow It was the grand finale in a series of flares from two extremely active regions In just 4 weeks these two regions produced some 12 X class flares and 43 M class flares This solar activity produced a long period of activity in the near Earth space environment NGDC maintains the GOES SEM and SXI archives and a satellite anomaly database for retrospective studies of these events Anomalies in satellite and instrument operations during these four weeks continue to be reported An interesting consequence of the solar flares was that they produced so many high energy particles that these particles contaminated the instrumentation on NASA s Advanced Composition Explorer ACE satellite that was designed to measure them On October 24th the Japanese lost contact with the ADEOS II satellite at 800 km altitude On October 28th the Japanese data relay satellite Kodama went into safe mode While in transfer orbit the Small Missions for Advanced Research in Technology satellite of the European Space Agency ESA reported various problems in transfer orbit The solar arrays on commercial geostationary TVsatellites showed a sharp degradation in power output from the solar panels to the onboard systems since October 20th Several CCD based instruments on NASA and NOAA satellites showed blinding snow caused by energetic particle contamination in the imagery layout table RIDGE 2000 Community Workshop Dr Chris Fox NGDC s acting director presented an overview of NGDC s plans and developments for Multibeam Bathymetric

for educational purposes This NOAA mobile lab has contributed greatly to cosmic ray research since the 1950s The cosmic ray neutron monitor was designed built and run by Hugh Carmichael Canada who donated it to NGDC when he retired After the budget cuts in the 1980s it lay dormant until it was loaned to Jim Ziegler of IBM They refurbished and moved it to the mainland to monitor cosmic rays at many different latitudes and altitudes It was finally taken to Leadville Colorado The data were used to define the effects of high energy particles on electronics UNH has a large group of cosmic ray physicists who will oversee the continuing research and educational use of the monitor in Leadville layout table ICESat Data Available Preliminary data from the Ice Cloud and land Elevation Satellite

Geomagnetic Storm Recovery and Impact of the 21 April 2002 Solar Flare subjects that interested Miss Lincoln greatly layout table Sun s Activity Gets Media Attention The Sun suddenly developed several enormous active regions which are pummeling the Earth with impacts unusually strong for this decreasing phase of the solar cycle The week of October 13 saw a quiet almost spotless solar disk However NOAA Active Region AR 10484 came around the east limb on Oct 17 possibly the return of the large AR10464 and by Oct 23 was producing X level solar flares It was joined by another region AR10486 which produced an X17 proton flare on Oct 28 The GOES SXI instrument was turned back on to monitor the activity after this enormous event occurred Several major geomagnetic storms followed the solar activity K s of nine the highest disturbed level of the geomagnetic field were seen on Oct 29 and 30 with severe G4 and extreme G5 levels on the NOAA Space Weather Scales during both days These storms produced auroral activity at low latitudes there were even reports from Germany that an invasion of UFOs was occurring Cosmic ray activity included three Ground Level Events GLEs there have only been 67 of these events seen since the 1940s when cosmic ray neutron monitors were invented GLE sharp increase of counts to 10 above background due to solar protons of energies greater than 500 MeV A number of satellites reported problems due to increased solar radiation An X8 solar flare on Nov 2 occurred as the AR10464 is on the West limb of the Sun Most of the explosion was not aimed squarely at Earth though there may be a glancing blow to Earth by the coronal mass ejection cloud NGDC archives the historical data about this solar activity and maintains the SXI archive website layout table

meeting NGDC will host a web site for the IBCSEP and provide technical training to representatives from Peru in December 2003 and Ecuador in March 2004 layout table SXI Imager Back On Line The Solar X ray Imager SXI has been temporarily shut down during most of September and October due to a technical problem but was reactivated on October 28th The timing of the SXI restart was pushed up due the appearance on the Sun of some extraordinarily high activity SXI captured the decay phase of the X17 flare and all phases of all major flares since then The obvious noise in the data on the 28th and 29th were due to energetic proton affects from the solar events All data old and new are available on the NGDC website http sxi ngdc noaa gov http sxi ngdc noaa gov http www ngdc noaa gov products
