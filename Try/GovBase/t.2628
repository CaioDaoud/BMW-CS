toward satisfying the required 5 years of continuous coverage Return to Active Federal Service If you elected to terminate your FEHB enrollment during your period of active military service it will be automatically reinstated when you are restored to a civilian position under the provisions of 5 CFR Part 353 However if you waive your rights to immediate reinstatement of FEHB to take advantage of
