roundtable at the National Press Club on March 25 Dr Kolar a research fishery biologist described her work predicting potential fish invaders in the Great Lakes and stressed that it was the wealth of data available for that region that allowed these advances to be made Dr Kolar was nominated by the Ecological Society to discuss at the roundtable some of her research findings and the need for long term data sets in studying invasive species USGS Hosts Sea Lamprey Control Meeting Sea lamprey a parasitic fish invaded the Great Lakes and contributed to population crashes of fishes such as lake trout by the early 1960s The USGS plays a vital science role in the program of chemical control that reduced sea lampreys to 10 of the harmful levels of the 1960s The Upper Midwest Environmental Sciences Center will host a one day meeting on April 16 for specialists from USGS the Great Lakes Fishery Commission the U S Fish and Wildlife Service and partner Canadian agencies Meeting participants will detail the historical and future research priorities for the sea lamprey chemical control research program guided by the Great Lakes Fishery Commission Cindy Kolar La Crosse WI 608 608 781 6223 ckolar usgs gov USGS Attends Aquatic Invasive Species Summit Aquatic invasive species have already proven they can move from the Great Lakes into the Mississippi drainages through canals built to connect these systems in Chicago Illinois Now two new invasive fishes bighead and silver carp have become invasive in the Mississippi River and may threaten the Great Lakes through this same canal system Dr Cindy Kolar USGS Upper Midwest Environmental Sciences Center will represent USGS at an Aquatic Invasive Species Summit in Chicago May 14 15 hosted by the Mayor of Chicago and the Regional Director of the US Fish and Wildlife Service Experts will identify potential solutions to the problem of invasives moving between the two basins as a starting point for more detailed feasibility studies for controlling such access and harmful ecological impacts Cindy Kolar La Crosse WI 608 608 781 6223 ckolar usgs gov USGS Voluntary Waterfowl Avoidance Successful Recreational boating often disturbs migratory waterfowl frightening birds from important feeding and resting areas Continual disturbance can result in birds that are ill prepared for the energetic demands of long distance migration USGS Scientists Kevin Kenow and Carl Korschgen Upper Midwest Environmental Sciences Center partnered with refuge managers on the Upper Mississippi River to test a voluntary program where boaters were asked to avoid certain bird feeding areas Birds in the voluntary avoidance areas fed and rested with little disturbance from the public thereby demonstrating a successful program and cooperation between government agencies and the public The scientists reported their findings in the March 2003 issue of Waterbirds staff bios kpk0 html Kevin Kenow La Crosse WI 608 781 6278 kevin kenow usgs gov USGS Reports on Selenium Findings In high concentrations the contaminant selenium can be fatal to waterfowl Previous work in the industrial portions of the Upper Midwest identified high selenium as a potential problem for lesser scaup a duck species that has been in decline for the past two decades Recent results by USGS scientists found little evidence of elevated selenium in birds migrating through nonindustrial areas Custer et al 2003 Ecotoxicology 12 47 54 This indicates that selenium contamination may not be widespread and may be restricted to industrial areas within the Mississippi Flyway staff bios cmc0 html Christine Custer La Crosse WI 608 781 6247 christine custer usgs gov Resource Managers Gain New Tools Resource specialists at Voyageurs National Park are gaining new information to better understand the extent and diversity of habitats they must manage USGS scientist Kevin Hop and colleagues have enhanced methods to classify and map vegetation types for this challenging 200 000 acre plus park with its rugged topography swamps islands and extensive lake systems On April 16 Hop and colleagues will present their work and a new field key for vegetation to Park Service specialists nationwide at the George Wright Society Meeting San Diego California The USGS NPS Vegetation Mapping Program designed to provide national parks with detailed maps of vegetation communities for park planning and monitoring and the USGS Upper Midwest Environmental Sciences Center partner in this effort staff bios kdh0 html Kevin Hop La Crosse WI 608 783 7550 ext 46 kevin hop usgs gov USGS Shares Monitoring Expertise Many species of once common birds and amphibians are showing alarming declines in their populations and in their distributions Monitoring these species understanding their distributions and documenting reasons for their decline are vitally important conservation activities Three USGS Upper Midwest Environmental Science Center scientists met with resource managers from National Parks in the western Great Lakes region on April 10 in Ashland Wisconsin to share information about regional monitoring and research priorities The USGS scientists shared work about conservation planning tools amphibian inventory efforts in Voyageur s National Park and the St Croix National Scenic Riverway and newly developed statistical models for predicting the abundances of Midwest bird species of concern USGS and the NPS will explore how the UMESC developed tools apply to other National Parks staff bios mgk0 html Melinda Knutson La Crosse WI

how to improve water quality by reducing the negative effects of excess nutrients in the Upper Mississippi River Excess nutrients can result in algae blooms poor growth of aquatic plants and reduced oxygen levels in water On April 4 Dr Richardson briefed the US Fish and Wildlife Service and US Army Corps of Engineers on past USGS nitrogen cycling research in the Upper Mississippi River and Mark Twain Refuges Richardson s research showed that managing water flows on refuge lands for waterfowl and fishes also significantly reduces potentially toxic ammonia in sediments and increases natural processes key to nitrogen removal Richardson outlined new research plans that will determine if excess nitrogen can be removed by managing water flows into backwater wetlands and lakes staff bios wbr0

course taught May 18 24 by the Institute for Bird Populations at the USGS Upper Midwest Environmental Sciences Center This activity is part of the Center s longstanding joint venture with La Crosse Wisconsin s School on the River Program After training area middle schoolers will assist researchers on long term monitoring of landbird populations along the Upper Mississippi River an area designated as a globally important bird area staff bios pjh0 html Pat Heglund La Crosse WI 608 781 6338 pat heglund usgs gov USGS Briefs Upper Mississippi River Stakeholders Director Dr Leslie Holland Bartels Upper Midwest Environmental Sciences Center will brief state and Federal representatives on the status of river monitoring activities and program accomplishments of the Long Term Resource Monitoring Program LTRMP She will present at the upcoming Upper Mississippi Basin Association and Environmental Management Program Coordinating Committee meetings in St Louis Missouri on May 14 15 The President s budget proposes a 65 increase for this program in FY 2004 Dr Holland Bartels will present the results of a series of analyses on river habitat changes fish invertebrate and vegetation communities and water quality trends in the system over the last eight years These results are the basis to propose the new structure of the LTRMP under an enhanced funding scenario staff bios lhb0
