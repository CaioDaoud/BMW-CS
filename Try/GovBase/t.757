ranging in wavelength from 0 4 m to 14 4 m The responses are custom tailored to the individual needs of the user community and provide exceptionally low out of band response Two bands are imaged at a nominal resolution of 250 m at nadir with five bands at 500 m and the remaining 29 bands at 1 km A 55 degree scanning pattern at the EOS orbit of 705 km achieves a 2 330 km swath and provides global coverage every one to two days The Scan Mirror Assembly uses a continuously rotating double sided scan mirror to scan 55 degrees and is driven by a motor encoder built to operate at 100 percent duty cycle throughout the 6 year instrument design life The optical system consists of a two mirror off axis afocal telescope which directs energy to four refractive objective assemblies one for each of the VIS NIR SWIR MWIR and LWIR spectral regions to cover a total spectral range of 0 4 to 14 4 m A high performance passive radiative cooler provides cooling to 83K for the 20 infrared spectral bands on two HgCdTe Focal Plane Assemblies FPAs Novel photodiode silicon readout technology for the visible and near infrared provide unsurpassed quantum efficiency and low noise readout with exceptional dynamic range Analog programmable gain and offset and FPA clock and bias electronics are located near the FPAs in two dedicated electronics modules the Space viewing Analog Module SAM and the Forward viewing Analog Module FAM A third module the Main Electronics Module MEM provides power control systems command and telemetry and calibration electronics The system also includes four on board calibrators as well as a view to space a Solar Diffuser SD a v groove Blackbody BB a Spectroradiometric calibration assembly SRCA and a Solar Diffuser Stability Monitor SDSM The first MODIS Flight Instrument ProtoFlight Model or PFM is integrated on the Terra EOS AM 1 spacecraft Terra successfully launched on December 18 1999 The second MODIS flight instrument Flight Model 1 or FM1 is inegrated on the Aqua EOS PM 1 spacecraft it was successfully launched on May 4 2002 These MODIS instruments will offer an unprecedented look at terrestrial atmospheric and ocean phenomenology for a wide and diverse community of users throughout the world cgi bin printable view cgi about design html Image used for Spacing purposes Curator mailto bmaccher pop900 gsfc nasa gov MODARCH Webmaster Authorized
