WordPerfect 9 6 18 2002 moninger Automated Meteorological Reports from Commercial Aircraft Published in the February 2003 issue of Bulletin American Meteorological Society 84 pp 203 216 Automated Meteorological Reports from Commercial Aircraft William R Moninger N 1 1 Richard D Mamrosh N 2 2 Patricia M Pauley N 3 3 ABSTRACT Commercial aircraft now provide over 130 000 meteorological observations per day including temperature winds and in some cases humidity vertical wind gust or eddy dissipation rate turbulence The temperature and wind data are used in most operational numerical weather prediction models at the National Centers for Environmental Prediction NCEP and at other centers worldwide At non synoptic times these data are often the primary source of upper air information over the U S Even at synoptic times these data are critical in depicting the atmosphere along oceanic air routes A web site http acweb fsl noaa gov http acweb fsl noaa gov has been developed that gives selected users access to these data Because the data are proprietary to the airlines real time access is restricted to entities such as government agencies and nonprofit research institutions although sample past data are available to all Data can be displayed in a variety of ways and can be downloaded for local processing We describe these data and show examples of how they have been useful in weather forecasting and numerical weather prediction 1 Introduction Automated weather reports from commercial aircraft have been an important data source for numerical weather prediction NWP models for more than a decade and have improved the forecasts from these models More recently direct access to these reports has become available to government weather forecasters and other researchers through a web site operated by NOAA s Forecast Systems Laboratory FSL Direct access to these data has resulted in better quality control of the data and more timely and accurate forecasts We provide an overview of the kinds of aircraft data that are currently available a brief history and overview of FSL s web site and other data distribution mechanisms a look at the use of the data in models and examples of the use of these data in research and operational forecasting 2 Data Sources a Overview 1 html Figure 1 Routine meteorological observations from aircraft have been taken since the days of World War I In 1919 the Weather Bureau began paying pilots of piston engine aircraft to fly with aerometeorographs strapped to the aircraft wing struts Hughes and Gedzelman 1995 Figure 1 The observations were recorded on a cylindrical chart that was retrieved after the aircraft landed the temperatures pressures and relative humidities were then read from the chart Harrison 1935 and disseminated as APOBs airplane observations Huschke 1959 p 37 Pilots were required to reach an altitude of at least 13500 ft in order to be paid and were given a 10 bonus for each 1000 ft above that At these altitudes pilots sometimes blacked out from lack of oxygen making this a very dangerous enterprise 12 pilots were killed between 1931 and 1938 Hughes and Gedzelman 1995 By 1937 the U S Government funded 30 regularly scheduled civilian and military aircraft soundings per day in the U S but by 1940 these were replaced by soundings made by the newly developed radiosonde NOAA NWS 2001 In fact an important step in validating the radiosonde was a comparison with collocated aircraft soundings Diamond et al 1938 However just as commercial aviation has become routine so have aircraft meteorological observations Voice pilot reports suitably encoded have been used in Numerical Weather Prediction NWP models for nearly four decades Automated aircraft reports first became available in 1979 Sparkman et al 1981 Giraytys et al 1981 Lord et al 1984 and have increased dramatically in the 1990 s 2 html Figure 2 Figure 2 shows a time history of both manual and automated wind reports used in NWP models from 1960 through 1999 from the National Centers for Environmental Prediction NCEP National Center for Atmospheric Research NCAR reanalysis project Kalnay et al 1996 Although not precisely equivalent to the number or reports available in real time these numbers do portray the general trends seen in operational reports 3 gif Figure 3 Figure 3 shows currently available automated data worldwide for 27 March 2002 More than 130 000 point observations of winds and temperature are now available daily Automated meteorological reports from aircraft are generically called AMDAR Aircraft Meteorological Data Relay reports In the United States however these data are generally referred to as ACARS data ACARS stands for Aircraft Communication Addressing and Reporting System a communication system operated for the airlines by Aeronautical Radio Inc ARINC that reports a number of aircraft parameters such as passenger loading and dispatch information along with weather information We use the term ACARS to refer to only the weather information from U S carriers The U S data are also sometimes referred to as MDCRS Meteorological Data Collection and Reporting System MDCRS Petersen et al 1992 is a database containing ACARS data and a distribution system that feeds the data from ARINC where the database resides to NCEP where the data are used in NCEP s operational models and placed on the GTS Global Telecommunications System for distribution to government NWP centers worldwide These reports generally include temperature and horizontal wind In addition some provide measurements of dewpoint and turbulence see section 2 c Six domestic airlines currently provide ACARS data American Delta Federal Express FedEx Northwest United UAL and United Parcel Service UPS In fig3 Figure 3 ACARS coverage comprising more than 102 000 observations is shown in red Outside of the U S AMDAR systems are established on a national or regional basis Communications for these systems are generally handled by SITA http www sita aero http www sita aero and other smaller providers rather than ARINC In 1986 the Australian program became the first operational AMDAR system Sprinkle 1999 Development was led by the Australian Bureau of Meteorology in conjunction with the airlines with the Bureau paying for the observations and controlling the type of observations the frequency of reports the region within which reports are made data quality and data distribution with the latter free to all users globally Stickland personal communication This model was later developed by all new AMDAR systems with the exception of the U S where the airlines pay for and retain control over the data AMDAR participating countries airlines currently include France Air France the United Kingdom British Airways the Netherlands KLM Germany Lufthansa Sweden SAS Australia Qantas New Zealand Air New Zealand and South Africa South African Airways In fig3 Figure 3 AMDAR coverage comprising more than 28 000 observations is shown in blue b Temporal spatial coverage and robustness A recent study of data coverage Jamison and Moninger 2002 that focused on data over the contiguous United States revealed the following Current ACARS data are highly temporally variable evening peaks and early morning minima of commercial air traffic cause the total number of reports per hour to vary by more than a factor of 4 Because package carriers UPS and FedEx generally do not fly on weekends the number of reports on those days is approximately 60 of the mid week value The bulk of near surface data is provided by the package carriers FedEx and UPS because they use a data format that provides high vertical resolution data at low levels Most data are gathered at flight levels 25000 45000 ft Figure 4 where they are distributed fairly uniformly over the CONUS 4 gif Figure 4 Below about 25 000 ft data are concentrated near major hubs Figure 5 5 gif Figure 5 Patterns over the rest of the world are similar Package carriers do not provide as large a fraction of data but some airlines such as Lufthansa do provide high vertical resolution data at low levels Unlike many other sources of meteorological data such as satellites radiosondes and automated surface stations aircraft can be directly affected by inclement weather when major storms occur aircraft often do not fly as most air travelers know all too well One of us looked at two major storms in order to assess the extent to which these storms disrupted aircraft data over the contiguous U S The storms studied were Hurricane Floyd which occurred during September 1999 Moninger 1999 and a major East Coast blizzard which occurred in January 2000 Moninger 2000 These studies concluded that extended periods of poor weather can indeed decrease the number of aircraft data both in the region of inclement weather and elsewhere The East Coast Blizzard for instance caused an 8 decrease in the nationwide aircraft soundings ascents and descents and affected regions such as Denver an 8 decrease far removed from the blizzard This is because a cancelled flight results in missed soundings at both the origin and destination airports and because grounded aircraft disrupt air traffic flow in general Ice and snow seem to be the most troublesome weather Low visibility alone does not affect landings when airport crew and equipment are certified for low visibility approaches though it may decrease throughput at busy airports Randy Baker personal communication Recovery from inclement weather events occurs relatively quickly at major hubs but may take several days at regional airports Radiosondes by contrast are more robust against inclement weather Most missed radiosondes are not caused by weather but by staffing or equipment problems NOAA 2000 Thus missing radiosondes are likely to be random in space and time Nonetheless aircraft data are the only in situ source of upper air data at non synoptic times and therefore are highly valuable c Turbulence and water vapor In addition to temperature and winds various measures of turbulence are also computed on some aircraft fleets Derived Equivalent Vertical Gust DEVG values have been included in all Australian AMDAR reports since their inception in 1985 WMO 1999 and in most European AMDAR reports after conversion to turbulence categories J Stickland personal communication A second measure in use on some aircraft is vertical acceleration reported in multiples of the acceleration of gravity These data have been found to be inaccurate for nonzero values of vertical acceleration but the data may be of value in measuring of the absence of turbulence critically necessary in calibrating turbulence forecasting models A third measure of turbulence is the NCAR developed Eddy Dissipation Rate EDR algorithm EDR is a state of the atmosphere rather than a state of the aircraft measure and so is independent of aircraft type and thus can be used in NWP models Cornman et al 1995 Stickland 1998 compared DEVG and EDR and recommended the use of EDR As of April 2002 AMDAR data include approximately 75 aircraft that report vertical gust and ACARS data include 75 aircraft reporting EDR and 90 reporting incorrect vertical acceleration A few aircraft report moisture aloft using the prototype Water Vapor Sensing System WVSS Fleming 1996 An initial assessment was performed in September 1999 using six UPS aircraft with promising early results Cunning 2000 Preliminary conclusions are that accuracy is similar to that for rawinsondes below 20000 ft 6 100 m and generally better above 20000 ft Fleming 2000 Humidity is currently March 2002 being measured reliably by 15 aircraft R Fleming personal communication 3 FSL Presentation and Distribution a History In the 1980 s FSL realized the potential of ACARS data to improve NWP models and successfully negotiated the receipt of data from four airlines Delta Northwest UAL and UPS These airlines route their ACARS data to FSL via ARINC as text and FSL decodes the variety of data formats from the various fleets currently more than 20 from 6 airlines In 1993 FSL established an ongoing effort to assess ACARS data quality flag apparently bad data and correct data where possible A program was developed Moninger and Miller 1994 to perform this task and a graphical display program was developed to facilitate evaluation of its performance One early result of the graphical display was to discover a fleet of aircraft whose reported longitudes were flipped around 95 West That is a longitude of 95 x became 95 x Thus some aircraft actually landing in Atlanta appeared to be landing in the Red River Valley of Oklahoma This problem had not been noticed in the preceding several years during which the data had been used The display program was web based so it could be accessed from any workstation within FSL There was no need or requirement to display the ACARS data outside the laboratory because the data are proprietary to the airlines and FSL was not to redistribute them Nonetheless the capability of the web to display the data more widely was immediately apparent The Chicago National Weather Service Forecast Office NWSFO had been using ACARS data from UAL activities at O Hare airport for several years to improve local forecasts Those data were sent as text via fax from UAL to the NWSFO On a visit to FSL a forecaster from the Chicago NWSFO saw the display saw the potential use of it in forecasting and requested access to it In response to his and other requests FSL held a meeting of participating airlines on March 20 1996 at which the airlines agreed to allow access to the web site by NWS forecast offices and some other organizations outside of FSL The current restrictions are described in section 6 b Web based display From its inception the ACARS display provided zoomable plan view plots of ACARS data over the contiguous United States as well of Skew T plots derived from ascent and descent portions of flight tracks The display has evolved considerably since then The current displays are available at http acweb fsl noaa gov http acweb fsl noaa gov under the category Demonstration of ACARS data display available to all no current data The capabilities of the displays are explained on the web site we provide a brief synopsis here The displays available are 1 the original version in which images are generated on FSL s server and sent to the user and 2 a faster more capable java based display in which the data are sent to users computers and display is controlled locally The discussion below describes the java based display Plan views of ACARS and now AMDAR data as well are available worldwide The view may be zoomed in by dragging the mouse across the region of interest Data can be restricted to particular altitude ranges data types and individual encrypted tail numbers Wind barbs can be shown and data can be color coded by altitude wind speed vertical gust vertical acceleration or EDR Airport locations may be shown as well 6 gif Figure 6 Figure 6 shows a zoomed in region of airspace with observations color coded by altitude and data values indicated for the observation under the cursor Portions of flight tracks that represent reasonable atmospheric soundings are indicated by a line connecting the observations If an ascent or descent portion of a flight track is clicked on a Skew T plot is displayed Additional sounding information from models and radiosondes may also be shown on the Skew T plot This is particularly helpful because most ACARS data lack dewpoint information Interactive parcel trajectories with associated thermodynamic indices may also be shown 7 gif Figure 7 Figure 7 shows a Skew T plot for the flight track by the cursor in fig6 Figure 6 This particular aircraft reports vapor information so both a temperature and dewpoint trace are shown Specific data values at the height represented by the cursor position are also shown Seventy percent of ACARS data is available for display within 20 min after measurements are taken other data are available later because some airlines buffer some of their data for up to several hours particularly on over ocean routes c Online forum A discussion forum is also linked from the FSL ACARS web page http acweb fsl noaa gov oper forum http acweb fsl noaa gov oper forum Subscribers to this forum receive email copies of anything posted This provides an efficient way to disseminate information about the data and displays and allows a productive public interchange of views about data quality appropriate use of the data and desired upgrades to the displays d Distribution The WMO Global Telecommunications System GTS is the official government to government exchange medium for ACARS AMDAR data On the other hand the FSL web site though unofficial and not guaranteed to be available at all times provides real time graphical access to the data unavailable elsewhere and provides data to non governmental organizations The FSL site is now used worldwide in operational forecasting and for providing data to local scale NWP models During April 2002 there were 2619 downloads of data to users computers for display as shown in Table 1 Table 1 Data downloads for the month of April 2002 Total data downloads 2617 NWS Forecast Offices 734 Foreign Forecast Offices 428 U S Air Traffic Control Centers 643 U S Airlines 322 U S Military Forecast Offices 247 Research 175 Other US government e g NTSB 68 In addition over 20 organizations receive data in real time via the web site or by using Unidata s LDM software Davis and Rew 1994 These organizations include NOAA NASA UCAR the Korean and Taiwanese Meteorological Agencies and universities 4 Measurement accuracy and quality control a Measurement and sampling Static and total air pressure are measured by an electronic barometer in the aircraft s pitot static probe Total air temperature is typically measured by an immersion thermometer probe Wind speed is deduced from knowledge of the air speed via the pitot static probe and ground speed usually from an inertial navigation system Painting 2002 These instruments generally sample at one to several Hz The samples are averaged for from one to 30 seconds depending on the aircraft and its altitude for each observation The resulting instrumental uncertainty has been calculated by Painting 2002 as follows For pressure 4 hPa at low altitudes decreasing to 2 hPa at 30 000 ft For temperature 0 4C but as much as 3C if probe wetting occurs For horizontal winds 2 3 m s 1 but more during maneuvers and may be as low as 1 1 m s 1 as described in the next section These instruments are well maintained by the airlines for legal cf FAA 2000 safety and economic reasons The data from them is recorded by flight recorders and used by systems that monitor the performance and location of the aircraft in flight and carry out flight planning tasks such as estimating fuel consumption and arrival times Bisiaux et al 1983 Painting 1997 Large errors in the airspeed vector determination can occur when the aircraft is maneuvering Bisiaux et al 1983 but these erroneous reports can be screened out by excluding reports with large aircraft roll angles Most reports include a flag that indicates roll angles 5 Temperature errors can also cause errors in the wind calculation since the airspeed calculation uses temperature For example at conditions typical of cruising altitudes a 5C temperature error could yield a wind speed error as large as 5 kts 2 6 m s 1 Painting 2002 b Accuracy from comparison with other data sources The data from automated aircraft compare well with each other with radiosondes and with model background fields In the latter half of July 2001 the Navy s quality control system Pauley 2003 in preparation rejected data as shown in Table 2 Table 2 Rejected Data ACARS AMDAR Duplicates 2 1 0 8 Bad reports 2 5 1 1 Bad temperature 0 5 0 0 Bad winds 0 8 0 4 These numbers are similar to other studies going back to the pioneering study by Brewster et al 1989 which found that 2 9 of temperatures and 0 9 of winds in automated aircraft reports were rejected by their quality control system Schwartz and Benjamin 1995 found that winds and temperatures in ACARS ascent descent profiles agreed well with high resolution rawinsonde soundings at Denver CO The difference standard deviations for these ACARS rawinsonde collocations were similar to those from rawinsonde rawinsonde comparisons implying that the ACARS relayed data are somewhat more accurate than rawinsonde data This study found temperature differences between ascent and descent measurements They found that ascent temperatures averaged 0 4C warmer than descent temperatures which seemed to be a cool bias in the descent values and no bias in the ascent values compared to rawinsonde observations Similar ascent descent differences were also reported by Richner and Gutermann 1987 Recently Benjamin et al 1999 estimated ACARS wind errors by examining ACARS ACARS collocations at Denver They estimated the horizontal wind component error in ACARS data to be 1 1 m s 1 and the temperature error to be 0 5C for the 400 300 mb layer where mesoscale variability is relatively small This is smaller than Morone s 1986 estimate of 2 1 3 1 m s 1 for the wind component error but her data sample was much smaller than that used by Benjamin et al 1999 These results are also consistent with Nash 1994 who found average rms differences between separated pairs of wind component observations to be 2 6 m s 1 He attributed 1 1 5 m s 1of this to instrumental uncertainty and the remainder to atmospheric variability over the distance between compared observations A comparison of ACARS temperatures with model background fields reveals that some aircraft have biases of a few degrees Celsius more often too warm than too cold Stickland Chouinard Benjamin personal communication The temperature reported the static air temperature is computed from the observed total air temperature and the Mach number which itself depends on the static pressure measurement The Mach number correction at cruising altitudes and speeds is typically 28C with an estimated uncertainty in the calculated static air temperature of 0 4C Painting 2002 Temperature errors therefore can result from errors in the total air temperature observation the static pressure observation the Mach number observation or the calculation procedures which involve the empirically determined probe recovery factor The total air temperature observation is a likely source of errors since the sensor can be adversely affected by moisture dirt insects or other foreign material that can coat or partially block the probe Stickland personal communication These errors appear to have been present since the earliest days of automated aircraft reports For example the ALPEX AIDS dataset examined by Richner and Gutermann 1987 included a training flight in which a particular aircraft made 24 take offs and landings at Milano within three hours They found that wind speeds agreed within approximately 1 m s after excluding reports with roll angles greater than 5 However they found that ascent profiles were 1 2 to 1 5C warmer than descent profiles but could not determine whether measurement error or mesoscale variability was the cause b Quality control Several efforts are underway at various government agencies to assess and control the quality of ACARS and AMDAR data before they are ingested by NWP models and or distributed to the broader community These centers include The WMO Designated U S Center for Monitoring Aircraft Observations NCEP Washington DC The Naval Research Laboratory Monterey CA The Forecast Systems Laboratory Boulder CO Moninger 1995 The EUMETNET E AMDAR program Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute KNMI Other national and regional centers in Europe European Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasting the United Kingdom France Germany Canada South Africa Australia New Zealand and Hong Kong Each center performs its own quality control before using the data in its models The QC schemes generally use one or more of three primary strategies The first compares observations to a background first guess model field and rejects observations with large departures Average departures over a few days or weeks can be used to isolate aircraft with consistent biases NCEP uses such statistics in adding or removing aircraft from their reject list Ballish personal communication The second performs a local objective analysis with and without a particular observation and rejects observations that cause large differences between the two analyses The third is independent of the data assimilation system and instead looks for commonly found errors using a series of rules i e a rule based system Without a comparison between the observation and the background in some manner this third methodology can pass through observations with significant errors and so is best partnered with one of the first two However a rule based system can also detect somewhat more subtle errors that would be passed by the first two but that could lead to significant errors in the resulting analyses An additional advantage of a rule based system is its utility in identifying systematic errors in the data that can be reported back to data providers and corrected Also individual forecasters who view the data via the FSL web site often bring data problems to the attention of FSL and this information is passed on to airlines and the other centers One difficulty in controlling the quality of the ACARS data is that individual aircraft tail numbers are encrypted Pilots organizations and airlines require encryption before data are distributed widely The encryption schemes used by ACARS and MDCRS do not allow identification of airlines nor of individual fleets within airlines It is important to have this information because often data problems are fleet wide and it is desirable to notify the appropriate airline when one of their fleets or aircraft is reporting erroneous data Recently the participating U S airlines agreed to allow FSL to share the translation between FSL encrypted tail numbers among the centers working on quality In this way the groups can communicate more clearly among themselves about data problems and can contact the appropriate airlines directly This has already resulted in improved feedback to the airlines and improved quality of the data The AMDAR system also uses encrypted tail numbers but these are designed to reveal the appropriate regional or national AMDAR focal point These focal points pass information between quality control researchers and the airlines The effectiveness of this strategy may be seen in Table 2 which shows considerably smaller error rates for AMDAR than for ACARS MDCRS 5 Uses in NWP models research and forecasting A number of studies have found a positive impact from using automated aircraft data in NWP systems These studies are summarized in Table 3 Table 3 NWP Model studies of the effectiveness of Automated Aircraft Data See http acweb fsl noaa gov bams ancillary http acweb fsl noaa gov bams ancillary for more details Baede et al 1983 Barwell and Lorenc 1985 Kruus 1986 Improved Northern Hemisphere jet stream analyses especially over the Pacific Ocean but these early studies included little aircraft data compared with currently available amounts Bell 1994 Inclusion of ACARS data leads to better representation of upper level features over the Atlantic ocean Benjamin et al 1991 Smith and Benjamin 1994 Schwartz et al 2000 In the RUC model ACARS data lead to significant improvements in 3 h and 6 h forecasts Wind errors reduced by approximately 10 Zapotocny et al 2000 In the ETA model ACARS is the most important data source for winds and the second most important data source after radiosondes for temperatures Graham et al 2000 In U K Meteorological Office models ACARS AMDAR most important data source for winds over the Atlantic Ocean and the second most important data source after radiosondes over North America More detail is forthcoming P M Pauley 2003 in preparation and may be found on the web at http acweb fsl noaa gov bams ancillary http acweb fsl noaa govbams ancillary In general these studies show that ACARS AMDAR now vie with radiosonde data as being the most important data source for these models and are often the most important In NWS Forecast Offices the data are often mentioned in forecast discussions particularly at offices near major hubs FSL maintains a record available on the web site of official NWS forecast discussions that mention aircraft or ACARS Table 4 summarizes some of the ways ACARS data are used in North America Table 4 Use of ACARS AMDAR data in forecasting research and training See Decker et al 1999 and http acweb fsl noaa gov bams ancillary http acweb fsl noaa gov bams ancillary for more details First reported by Use Vancouver and Houston forecast

wind fields caused by migrating birds COMET ACARS is now a standard part of NWS forecaster training Chicago forecast office ACARS is the only data source sufficiently dense in time and space to initialize a lake breeze model for the Chicago area This model is used operationally and has improved forecasts Labas et al 1999 U Washington Portland forecast office ACARS is basis for mesoscale wind model for Columbia River gorge Sharp and Mass 2001 Two examples are particularly noteworthy and are mentioned here a Timely forecasting of severe thunderstorm initiation On 5 May 1997 forecasters at the Chicago NWSFO were able to predict when a temperature inversion would be overcome by surface heating and frontal lifting to produce thunderstorms The data helped them accurately issue severe weather warnings for large hail and damaging winds associated with the thunderstorms a name fig8 8 gif Figure 8 Figure 8 at 1515 UTC shows a low level inversion and 60 knot winds at 900 mb The inversion suggested that significant surface heating would be required to achieve convection but that if it occurred damaging winds would be a possibility a name fig9 9 gif Figure 9 Figure 9 shows that the inversion had lifted and weakened at 1623 UTC but remained strong enough to inhibit convection 500 mb temperatures of 20 C continued 50 knot winds in low levels and little directional shear suggested that damaging non tornadic winds and hail were the main threats These soundings were faxed to the Storm Prediction Center in Norman Ok which found them useful in deciding to issue a severe thunderstorm watch for northern Illinois and northwestern Indiana a name fig10 10 gif Figure 10 A sounding from 1738 UTC Figure 10 shows that considering a surface dewpoint of 13 C the midlevel cap has been broken Scattered thunderstorms developed about half an hour later and produced several reports of 70 to 80 knot winds and golf ball size hail The forecasters were able to issue short term forecasts stating when thunderstorms were expected to form based on the weakening of the midlevel cap revealed by the ACARS data They were also confident that the primary severe weather threat was large hail based on the very cold 500 mb temperatures and strong surface winds 50 70 knot midlevel winds instead of tornadoes the wind field had little directional wind shear A more detailed account of this event can be found in Mamrosh 1998 b Airliner low on fuel over the ocean At about 1200 UTC on 6 February 1998 the Miami Center Weather Service Unit CWSU was notified that an airliner had encountered sustained strong headwinds over the Atlantic that were not taken into account when the plane was fueled in Italy The pilot was concerned that they might suffer fuel exhaustion en route He needed an altitude that offered substantially smaller headwinds because he was approaching critical fuel Fortunately the ACARS web page showed a flight track over the Bahamas less than one hour old with headwinds 40 knots 21 m s 1 less than the winds that the airliner was reporting Controllers immediately assigned the airliner to that altitude and flight path and the aircraft was able to complete the flight without incident Figure 11 shows wind reports from three aircraft over the Bahamas for 1500 1659 UTC that day the aircraft with low fuel did not generate reports a name fig11 11 gif Figure 11 6 Availability Because the ACARS data processed at FSL are proprietary to the airlines providing the data guidelines have been developed regarding access These are listed here and are available at the FSL ACARS AMDAR website In these guidelines ACARS refers to all aircraft data from FSL including AMDAR data Real time ACARS data may be made available to those organizations that are performing research which in the judgment of FSL is likely to benefit the airlines providing the data The data may not be redistributed in real time However the use of images in research publications is allowed and encouraged Researchers are encouraged to use ACARS data in Numerical Weather Prediction models NWP model results may be made available to the public in real time provided that all of the following conditions are met Individual ACARS measurements may not be revealed though gross numbers may be ACARS must be one of several kinds of input observations such as radiosondes and METARs The model and data may not be used to develop products or services for sale Real time data are available to government agencies such as NOAA in support of forecasting operations Real time data may be made available only to those airlines that provide ACARS meteorological data to the US Government at their own expense Data may not be shared with affiliate or code share airlines Real time data may not be made available to commercial entities that would use them to develop products or services they plan to offer for sale to the participating airlines Persons wishing to receive ACARS AMDAR data from FSL should contact acars request fsl noaa gov explaining how their organization falls under the guidelines above Those who do not fall under the guidelines may nonetheless benefit from the data ACARS data are the primary upper air input to the RUC Schwartz et al 2000 and Eta models particularly at nonsynoptic times Output from these models including interactive soundings and meteograms are freely available to all RUC soundings may be found on the web at http www frd fsl noaa gov mab soundings java http www frd fsl noaa gov mab soundings java java and http www frd fsl noaa gov mab

noaa gov mmb meteograms Archived data are in principle available at the National Climatic Data Center Robert Summers NCDC 2002 personal communication however these data are stored with other meteorological data in the PREPBUFR format which is an internal format used at NCEP Interested users would have to acquire and adopt appropriate software to extract and decode the ACARS actually MDCRS data 7 The future We expect a continuance of the trend toward increasing numbers of countries with AMDAR programs and of aircraft equipped to provide meteorological observations Additional countries and airlines will become active in the AMDAR program in the near future Countries currently developing systems include Saudi Arabia Hong Kong Japan and Canada WMO 1999 Stickland 2000a b The Canadian project will be unique in that it will be the first AMDAR program to include the smaller regional aircraft which will provide observations from some of the more remote regions of Canada and at lower altitudes than larger aircraft Stickland 2000b In addition the WMO AMDAR panel is working with the Russian Federation and countries in the Middle East Central and West Africa Asia and South America that have indicated they wish to develop AMDAR programs Within the United States there is an effort funded by NASA and FAA to increase data coverage below 20000 ft and around smaller airports This effort called TAMDAR Tropospheric AMDAR Daniels 2002 is in its early stages An inexpensive sensor designed for the smaller aircraft used by regional airlines is being developed and will be tested in 2002 The sensor will measure winds aloft temperature dewpoint icing and turbulence One current weakness of ACARS and AMDAR data is that very few aircraft report moisture A new moisture sensor WVSS II Fleming 2000 is being developed and plans are to deploy this sensor in up to 35 aircraft in 2003 Turbulence data are currently available in several forms as described in section 2 4 Expansion of EDR data the most promising method of turbulence measurement was delayed for several years by a patent dispute The dispute has now been settled and we expect the number of aircraft reporting EDR to increase dramatically over the next few years These data will be helpful now in model verification and algorithm development and eventually may be useful as model inputs 8 Concluding remarks ACARS and AMDAR data are greatly increasing in number and coverage These data are improving the performance of NWP models and thanks to distribution over the web are also improving human generated forecasts The data are also a valuable research tool that can profitably be used more widely As the volume of these data continues to increase particularly as more water vapor and turbulence data become available and as regional coverage below 25000 ft increases they will play an increasingly important role in atmospheric science 9 Acknowledgments We wish to thank the six participating U S Airlines American
