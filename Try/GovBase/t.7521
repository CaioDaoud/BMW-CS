this metal loaded gel shows the opalescence caused by diffracted light within the ordered void structure Metal Nanoparticle Formation in Ordered Carbons Periodic macroporous solids are currently being investigated for a range of applications including catalysis separations photonic crystals and nanoelectronics A common method for preparing three dimensionally 3D ordered macroporous solids uses close packed arrays of monodisperse spheres as templates In this approach the interstitial regions of these colloidal crystals are infused with a reaction solution of the material that will eventually comprise the replicate structure Once the composite has formed the template is then removed either chemically or thermally yielding the macroporous replicate solid with periodic voids in the 0 1 1 m size range A variety of macroporous materials have been prepared by this method including silica metal oxides metals carbon and polymers A promising extension of the template approach toward ordered porous materials of higher complexity is the development of methods that allows one to tailor composition and porosity of the wall structure defining the macropores Such an advance will be extremely important in the design of new ordered macroporous materials for catalysis separations and sensor applications Our approach to the template assisted preparation of ordered macroporous carbons OMC that contain distributions of metal M Co Ni Cu nanoparticles uses our recently developed sol gel technique for synthesizing metal doped carbon aerogels This technique which involves the sol gel polymerization of resorcinol derivatives containing ion exchange moieties is an effective method to uniformly incorporate metal ions into the aerogel matrix For example the base catalyzed polymerization of formaldehyde with potassium salt of 2 4 dihydroxybenzoic acid produces a K doped hydrogel The potassium ions in the hydrogel can then be replaced with the desired metal ion through ion exchange and the metal doped hydrogels can then be processed and carbonized to generate a metal doped carbon aerogel We also noted that certain metal ions are reduced during the carbonization process leading to the formation of nanometer sized metallic particles that are distributed throughout the carbon matrix When this same sol gel technique is used novel ordered porous carbons can be prepared that not only contain homogeneous distributions of metallic species but also possess a hierarchical pore structure due to the mesoporosity in the wall structure This feature is important as the mesopores allow access to the metal particles and serve as interconnections between the large ordered macropores To demonstrate the utility of this approach the rest of this article describes the synthesis and physical characterization of novel OMC containing Co Ni and Cu nanoparticles Figure 2 Preparation of Metal Doped Ordered Macroporous Carbons The synthesis of the metal doped OMCs is summarized in Figure 2 The colloidal crystal template was prepared by filtering a dilute solution of monodisperse polystyrene PS particles 300 or 450 nm through a narrow pore membrane resulting in the accumulation of 3D ordered layers of the PS spheres on the membrane surface An organic sol was infused into the void spaces of the template using filtration After the K doped hydrogel was formed within the template the resulting PS sol gel composite was soaked in a 0 1 M aqueous solution of M NO3 2 for 48 h to exchange the potassium ions for the desired metal ion The template was then dissolved from the M2 doped sol gel replica which was then dried using supercritical carbon dioxide to afford the metal doped ordered macroporous organic aerogel The metal doped OMC was obtained through pyrolysis of the organic aerogel at 800 C under nitrogen Examination of the metal doped OMCs by scanning electron microscopy SEM shows that their macropore structure consists of hexagonally ordered domains of spherical cavities with different crystal orientations reflecting the symmetry of the original PS template In the precarbonized samples the sizes of the voids are close to the size of the original latex spheres indicating that template removal through dissolution with toluene does not significantly perturb the overall void network Following carbonization the sizes of the macropores are 40 50 smaller than the sizes of the voids in the uncarbonized material Figure 3a The shrinkage of the ordered lattices in the carbon material is related to the carbonization process During pyrolysis of organic aerogels significant mass loss occurs leading to volumetric shrinkage and densification in the resulting carbon aerogels Interestingly the shrinkage of the carbon matrix in the metal doped OMCs occurs in a uniform fashion and does not alter the spherical shape of the voids The SEM images also show that the sol gel material completely fills the void spaces between the PS spheres resulting in the formation of volume templated structures Figure 3 Micrographs of metal doped OMCs a an SEM image of a Co doped OMC prepared using an ordered array of 450 nm PS spheres as a template and b a TEM image of a Ni doped OMC prepared using an ordered array of 300 nm PS spheres as a template The ordered macropore network is also clearly visible in the transmission electron micrographs of the metaldoped OMCs Figure 3b In addition transmission electronic microscopy TEM images reveal the dense networks of interconnected carbon particles that define the meso and microporosity in the wall structure This porosity is an important aspect of these materials since these mesopores provide access to the metal sites and serve as interconnections between the ordered macropores We examined the mesoporosity of the metaldoped OMCs using nitrogen adsorption desorption techniques The SEM and TEM images of the metal doped OMCs show the presence of metal nanoparticles throughout the carbon framework ranging in size from 5 to 60 nm The metal particles are formed through reduction of the M2 ions during pyrolysis of the organic aerogel since there are no visible metal particles or precipitated metal salts in the micrographs of the precarbonized metaldoped materials While the larger metal particles are visible as bright spots in the SEM images Figure 3a the smaller nanoparticles can be seen dispersed throughout the carbon matrix in the TEM images as indicated by the arrows in Figure 3b The x ray diffraction patterns of the metal doped OMCs indicate that the metal particles have a cubic crystalline structure and that the crystallite size of the Co particles is smaller than those for the Ni and Cu particles Our approach using the template assisted synthesis of novel OMCs containing metal nanoparticles and a hierarchical pore structure is general and as a result can be used to prepare OMCs with a wide variety of metal species and different wall porosities In addition we can control the size of the metal particles through the carbonization temperature We are currently investigating the catalytic and transport properties of these ordered macroporous metal doped carbon aerogels and the results will be the subject of a future report Contact bios baumannbio html Theodore F Baumann mailto baumann2 llnl gov baumann2 llnl gov and Joe H
