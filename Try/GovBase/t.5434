U S Geological Survey Volcano Hazards Program A comprehensive overview of the U S Geological Survey s Volcano Hazards Program and current volcanic activity in the United States The Volcano Hazards Program monitors volcanoes and collects the best possible scientific information on volcanoes in the United States and elsewhere to reduce the risk from volcanic activity Site includes links to the

National Park In July 2003 Norris Geyser Basin at Yellowstone National Park lived up to its hot unstable reputation as scientists and visitors witnessed changes in many geysers and increased ground temperatures in the basin The Yellowstone Volcano Observatory YVO seized the opportunity to learn about the activity by installing a temporary monitoring network photo inset In the coming months scientists will be poring over the mounds of digitally acquired data for possible clues to the renewed heating at Norris http volcanoes usgs gov yvo 2003norris html Full story What s New on USGS

by scientists of the USGS Cascades Volcano Observatory This presentation uses data from several eruptive episodes of Mount St Helens in the 1980 s to show the way in which a series of eruptions were
