receive addresses by foreign leaders and dignitaries There are three such methods joint meetings joint sessions and separate House and Senate receptions What is a joint meeting of Congress A joint meeting is the preferred method for receiving addresses from foreign leaders and dignitaries Joint meetings also are used for special commemorative events and to receive addresses by domestic dignitaries To initiate a joint meeting both houses by resolution or by unanimous consent declare themselves in recess for a joint gathering in the House chamber House Rule IV governs this procedure The Hall of the House shall be used only for the legislative business of the House and for caucus and conference meetings of its Members except when the House agrees to take part in any ceremonies to be observed therein The Speaker may not entertain a motion for the suspension of this clause As precedent has evolved however the House has tended to use unanimous consent rather than a resolution for the purpose of receiving a foreign leader What is a joint session of Congress A joint session of Congress has been used almost exclusively to receive the President s State of the Union Address prior to 1942 called the Annual Message other presidential addresses and the counting of electoral votes for the President and Vice President of the U S Both chambers follow a formal procedure to establish these occasions by adopting a concurrent resolution Only twice have foreign dignitaries addressed a joint session of Congress French Ambassador Andre de Laboulaye 20 May 1934 to mark the centennial of the death of the Marquis de Lafayette and Cuban Ambassador Guillermo Belt 19 April 1948 to commemorate the 50th anniversary of Cuban independence after the Spanish American War in 1898 What is a House or Senate reception Earlier in Congressional history the standard manner in which both the House and the Senate received addresses by foreign leaders was to invite dignitaries to a one chamber reception This procedure required either unanimous consent or resolution by the chamber that wished to receive the foreign leader According to Congressional Research Service CRS 122 such receptions have occurred in both chambers Louis Kossuth Governor of Hungary was the first foreign dignitary to address a Senate reception 5 January 1852 and a House reception 10 January 1852 These receptions are not associated with other informal social receptions and lunches provided for foreign leaders on behalf of congressional leadership or individual committees In the post World War II era the practice of using one chamber receptions largely disappeared The last Senate reception to host a foreign dignitary was held for West German Chancellor Kurt Kiesinger 18 August 1967 the last House reception was held for Mexican President Joe Lopez Portillo 17 February 1977 Trends over time As the United States attained greater status in the 20th century the method used to invite foreign leaders and dignitaries to address Congress evolved The practice of receiving foreign leaders before joint meetings or joint sessions was exceedingly rare prior to World War II The French general and Revolutionary War hero the Marquis de Lafayette made the first joint meeting address before Congress in 1824 A full half century passed before another foreign leader was extended the honor On 18 December 1874 King David Kalakaua of Hawaii became the first member of royalty accorded the honor of appearing before a joint meeting of Congress Hawaiian Chief Justice Elisha Hunt Allen a former Member of the U S House delivered the king s address because the monarch was incapacitated with a head cold French Ambassador Andre de Laboulaye spoke before a joint session of Congress on 20 May 1934 British Prime Minister Winston Churchill addressed a joint meeting of Congress on 26 December 1941 less than three weeks after the U S entered World War II Churchill s address the first of three he delivered before Congress began a new trend in which Congress invited foreign leaders to address joint meetings rather than just one chamber receptions Within the next decade nine additional joint meetings were held for foreign leaders After the Second World War foreign leaders who addressed joint meetings often represented America s close wartime allies particularly those from Atlantic Alliance countries A large number also represented newly emerging democracies in Asia South America Latin America and Africa Fast Facts Below are some quick reference facts about foreign leaders and
