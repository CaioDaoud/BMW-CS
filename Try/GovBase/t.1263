operational workstation to operational forecasters It allows users to view model output and real time meteorological data in a three dimensional interactive display One of the values of 3D for forecasting is that it is a rapid method to assimilate a large amount of model output and analysis data and understand how the features vary with height The core visualization software of D3D is http
