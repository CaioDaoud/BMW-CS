htm Executive Summary is also available This report by Laudan Aron and Krista Olson of the Urban Institute focuses on recent efforts by child welfare agencies to take account of battering experienced by mothers in cases of child abuse and neglect These efforts are in their infancy The study s goal is to document what child welfare agencies in five state and local communities are doing in attempting to integrate domestic violence concerns into their agency routines and to identify and highlight issues that a child welfare agency would do well to consider before proceeding with similar efforts This report should be read with the understanding that it presents few answers or best practices Instead it raises issues that on the basis of fieldwork seem critical for child welfare agencies to consider as they address domestic violence among families in their caseloads You may also download the full report in WordPerfect format as a compressed self extracting file ftp aspe hhs

1996 The http aspe hhs gov hsp cyp domvilnz htm full report 385k is also available The past two decades have seen dramatic changes in the response to domestic violence in communities throughout the United States In many communities the justice systems have experienced a number of important changes in their laws and agency practices related to domestic violence At the same time social services for battered women have become more widely available with substantial growth in domestic violence hotlines and shelters This study by Sandra Clark Martha Burt Margaret Schulte and Karen Maguire of the Urban Institute examines coordinated responses to domestic violence in six communities that have expanded their response to include a broad array of agencies beyond the justice system Many of these efforts are in their early stages and do not provide definitive answers about the best approach to coordination or the likely outcomes However the experiences of these communities raise a number of important issues for other communities to consider as they seek new ways to address this complicated problem You may download the full report in WordPerfect format as a compressed self extracting file
