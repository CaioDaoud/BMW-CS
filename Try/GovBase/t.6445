Governor Gary Locke December 4 2003 Washington Nuclear Project 1 We are a very resourceful state This week we again demonstrated our ability to creatively handle tough challenges even if it takes some time to reach the right solutions In the 1970s our state began an ambitious program to increase energy production The Washington Public Power Supply System WPPSS started construction on five nuclear power plants three at Hanford two in Grays Harbor County The plants were expected to generate several thousand megawatts of electric power for the Pacific Northwest But in the early 1980s WPPSS defaulted on some of its bonds Construction stopped on all but one of the five power plants This was the largest bond default in U S history at the time and it led to some collective soul searching True to form we picked up the pieces and moved on The site of the two unfinished reactors at Satsop in Grays Harbor County is now a thriving industrial and technology center This center is home to innovative companies providing hundreds of jobs The completed reactor at Hanford the Columbia Generating Station now operates with one of the best safety efficiency and reliability records of all nuclear plants in the nation And this week we signed an agreement for restoring the sites of the two remaining unfinished plants at Hanford Fortunately we are not dealing with cleanup of nuclear waste or radioactive fuels These plants were never operational No radioactive material was ever brought on site But for years the question of what to do with the unfinished structures lingered And questions remained about legal responsibility and how to restore the site in a fiscally responsible way to avoid rate impacts to utility customers Under the new agreement the Bonneville Power Administration and Energy Northwest the entity that evolved from the former Public Supply System will take immediate measures to ensure health and safety at the unfinished Hanford plants This work will be completed within 24 months Then the main structures will be sealed and partially covered by earth All other structures will be removed and the site will otherwise be restored to its original condition The restoration will proceed at a pace that avoids rate increases to Northwest utility consumers and the state will receive 3 5 million for off site mitigation This money will be used to purchase land to protect critical habitat We ve seen the Satsop site transformed into a successful industrial and technology center Hopefully we will be equally successful in finding opportunities for economic development at the Hanford site This week s agreement concludes a challenging chapter in our state s history And we showed that through persistence patience and partnership we can turn adverse circumstances into success stories Sincerely Gary Locke Gary Locke Governor This table is used for layout Newspaper press press asp Press Releases Review the latest press releases or subscribe to the
