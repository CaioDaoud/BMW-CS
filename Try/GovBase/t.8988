quantitatively and qualitatively and develop integrated models an understanding of coal systems Coal systems are defined by the processes that impact a peat accumulation from its inception to the resulting coal deposit that exists in the ground Coal systems are the result of the geological processes related to the formation chemical and physical alteration and thermal maturation of the organic sediment These processes determine the value of coal as a resource and its potential to generate and store methane and other gases COAL PRODUCTS PUBLICATIONS WRITTEN OR CREATED PRIMARILY BY EERT AUTHORS YEARS 1995 TODAY coal new products htm New USGS Coal Products and Publications coal new products htm Years 2000 Today Choose this link to view USGS coal products and publications that have dates only from the year 2000 up to today coal abstracts htm USGS Coal Abstracts USGS Abstracts are condensed but informative summaries of presentations made at meetings of scientific and professional organizations Typically abstracts summarize the principal conclusions of an author s current work but contain little supporting data coal bulletins circulars htm USGS Coal Bulletins USGS Coal Circulars USGS Bulletins contain significant data and interpretations that are of lasting scientific interest but are generally more limited in scope or geographic coverage than professional papers Bulletins include the results of resource studies and of geologic and topographic investigations as well as collections of short papers related to a specific topic USGS Circulars present technical or non technical information of wide popular interest in a format designed for distribution at no cost to the public Circulars are published to disseminate administrative information or important scientific information of an ephemeral nature coal cd roms htm USGS Coal CD ROMs Digital Data Series The Digital Data Series DDS encompasses a wide range of USGS digital data including computer programs interpreted results of investigations comprehensive reviewed data bases spatial data sets digital images and animation and multimedia presentations that are not intended for printed release The information is primarily for viewing processing and or analyzing by computer coal databases htm USGS Coal Databases Easily accessible USGS collections of related data concerning multiple resource economics related issues coal factsheets htm USGS Coal Fact Sheets USGS Fact Sheets typically provide a brief general overview to research and investigations of the USGS or provide details about particular activities Fact Sheets are used to disseminate timely information on scientific and technical programs of the U S Geological Survey and aimed at a general audience coal maps htm USGS Coal Maps coal satellite htm USGS Coal Satellite Image Maps USGS EERT maps are categorized as geologic quadrangle geophysical investigations miscellaneous investigations coal investigations oil and gas investigations miscellaneous field studies maps Satellite image maps are aerial photographs taken from orbiting U S Government satellites such as LandSat 7 If you are unable to find a particular map under this sub heading try accessing the other Products and Publications sub headings on this page Maps are often embedded in other standard USGS products and publications coal openfile reports htm USGS Coal Open File Reports USGS Open file Reports include unpublished manuscript reports maps field notes data compilations and other materials that are made available for public consultation at depositories They are a nonpermanent form of publication that may be cited in other publications as sources of information coal pro papers htm USGS Coal Professional Papers USGS Professional Papers are mainly comprehensive scientific reports of wide and lasting interest and importance to professional scientists and engineers Included are reports on the results of resource studies and of topographic hydrologic and geologic investigations They also include collections of related papers addressing different aspects of a single scientific topic coal outside pubs htm Non USGS Coal Outside Publications Scientific papers written by USGS employees and published in technical or trade journals scientific books or textbooks special volumes of scientific societies etc outside of the U S
