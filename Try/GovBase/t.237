IGES IGES Translation Notes http step nasa gov Return to NASA STEP Central IGES is the Initial Graphics Exchange Specification ANSI ASME Y14 26M 1989 Note STEP ISO 10303 is a demonstrably superior technology to IGES so the use of STEP instead of IGES is strongly encouraged for all new data exchange applications However these notes are provided for those who may have legacy IGES data or who may not yet have acquired a STEP translator for their software application but have an IGES translator IGES Tips Lessons Learned IGES is not an exact science It often requires much tweaking on a per file basis while drawing on past experiences This document is a collection of Lessons Learned related to the conversion and flavoring of IGES files Contributor Brent A Newsom Mechanical Engineer NASA Support Operations MSFC INTERGRAPH Huntsville AL 205 544 6656 mailto bnewsom ingr com bnewsom ingr com EMS Files Conversion of an active EMS file to IGES using MSFC custom interface Turn all layers ON in all views turn Element Display and Element Locate ON for all elements and fit all views Delete all elements not to be translated Select the directory in which to place the resulting IGES file Select a flavor and enter the desired Chord Height Tolerance Prepare the active file for conversion using the Prepare Active EMS File button remember not to save when exiting EMS Save the prepared file under a new name using the Save Active EMS File button the saved file will be placed in the directory shown in the form EMS IGES and log file information will be filled in automatically Submit the EMS file for conversion using the Submit EMS File in Form button the IGES file will be placed in the directory shown in the form View the log file using the View Log File in Form button View the IGES file using the View IGES File in Form button this will automatically bring up IGESVIEW which is a third party IGES viewer by IGES Data Analysis Inc Note Non active EMS files can be converted to IGES by filling in the directory EMS IGES and log file information in the form and then pressing the Submit button A non active EMS file cannot be prepared PATRAN Note The P3 PATRAN flavor button uses the Surface NURB Curve as Polynomial Curve and All Surfaces as NURBs options Toggle the NURBs Accelerator OFF The NURBs Accelerator by default causes curve and surface geometry to be converted to a piecewise polynomial format Although this option provides an increase in display performance problems may occur when importing IGES files Disable the translation of invisible entities and select only the desired entities to be translated Decrease global tolerance if gaps are present between surfaces after conversion RASNA Note The RASNA flavor button uses the Surface option PRO E Note Watch for tolerance problems PTC modeling tolerance by default is two orders of magnitude looser than EMS bastol IDEAS General Output IGES file from IDEAS using the trimmed curve option only It is important to address tolerance issues before modeling in IDEAS By default the IDEAS modeling tolerance is set to 0 01 mm or 3 94E 4 in EMS by default is much tighter at 1E 6 in Comments specific to EMS to IGES conversions The STOP button may be used to abort if an error occurs when networking with the remote server When the conversion script is running each step in the process is echoed to the window from which EMS was invoked It is helpful if this window is visible before bringing up the form Set the Chord Height Tolerance equal to that of the model file usually 0 001 Elements with display OFF and elements on layers that have been turned OFF are translated Elements that are ineligible for selection are not translated Use Locate Eligibility and Change Layer Locate Eligibility to change the status of these elements If problems occur with derived surfaces and solids created from b spline curves revolutions projections etc try splitting the surfaces at the cusps When placing skins surfaces by boundaries and other complex surfaces break up into smaller sections For example it may not always be best to use one complex skinning cross section when it can be represented by several simpler sections Webmaster http step nasa gov people waterbug html Steve Waterbury email mailto stephen c waterbury nasa gov stephen c waterbury nasa gov Responsible NASA Contact Stephen Waterbury Chair NASA Product Data Exchange Working Group http www nasa gov NASA Logo NASA WWW Home Page
