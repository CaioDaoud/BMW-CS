the harbor for Tacoma Washington located at the southern end of Puget Sound Beginning in the early 1900 s intertidal areas and tideflats of the Puyallup River delta were filled in and meandering streams were channelized resulting in the present configuration of eight waterways Hylebos Blair Sitcum Milwaukee St Paul Middle Thea Foss and Wheeler Osgood leading into the Bay Industrial and commercial activities are located on or adjacent to each of the waterways and include pulp and lumber mills shipbuilding and ship repair facilities shipping docks marinas chlorine and chemical production concrete production aluminum smelting oil refining and food processing plants automotive repair shops railroad operations and numerous other storage transportation and chemical manufacturing companies Contaminants originate from both point and non point sources In all a total of 763 drains pipes seeps open channels and other point and non point discharges have been identified although only a fraction of the 400 odd storm drains that discharge to the Bay have been associated with sediment contamination Commencement Bay Nearshore Tideflats Record of Decision ROD EPA 1989 The nearshore area and waterways of Commencement Bay are used extensively as rearing and feeding habitat by numerous marine species and the Bay itself serves as a migratory pathway for salmonids Three hatcheries annually stock approximately four million chinook coho and chum salmon and steelhead trout juveniles into the Puyallup River watershed Many fish species feed on small epibenthic and benthic organisms before migrating offshore NOAA s concerns about the Commencement Bay area involve the adverse effects to its trust resources caused by the release of hazardous substances in the Bay and its waterways with consequent contamination of sediments on the bottom of the Bay EPA s ROD for the Nearshore Tideflats Superfund Site treats each of the contaminated waterways as a distinct operable unit EPA is addressing remedial action on a waterway by waterway basis while the Trustees are addressing damage assessment and restoration on a Bay wide basis EPA has identified over 150 Potentially Responsible Parties PRPs for the Nearshore Tideflats Superfund Site In October 1991 the Trustees formally initiated the damage assessment and restoration planning process by issuing a Preassessment Screen Determination to Perform Assessment and Notice of Intent to Perform Assessment Since that time the Trustees occasionally in conjunction with several PRPs have been compiling existing data conducting studies of injuries to natural resources resulting from exposure to hazardous substances and planning and carrying out projects to restore injured resources and habitats COMMENCEMENT BAY NATURAL RESOURCE TRUSTEES http www noaa gov NOAA through the http www darcnw noaa gov DARC NW office http www doi gov U S Department of the Interior http www fws gov U S Fish
