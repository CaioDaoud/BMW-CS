Graphic of Coral Reef Hurricane Mitch had multiple and complex impacts on Honduran coral reefs Some of these impacts were negative while others had positive effects on the Honduran reef ecosystems All effects were compounded by continuing environmental stress on Bay Island Reefs from coral bleaching and overfishing Managers of environmental preserves government planners as well as resort owners need data and interpretations in order to help them deal with the effects of Hurricane Mitch in the context of continuing environmental changes Objectives Provide coral reef resource managers with descriptions of the processes that impacted reef ecosystems as a result of Hurricane Mitch and the relative importance of these impacts Establish monitoring protocols that can help put Mitch related impacts in perspective Provide training and technology transfer to enable Honduran counterparts to continue monitoring coral reef ecosystems after this project has ended Approach USGS participants in this project will work closely with appropriate Honduran resource managers to train personnel supply equipment and collect data for coral reef resource management They will also create and provide maps of selected reefs appropriate for reef resource evaluation Finally they will describe and evaluate the relative importance of Mitch related impacts on coral reef ecosystems particularly the hurricane s effect on water temperature salinity and turbidity These three activities will provide the information needed by Honduran managers to make informed decisions concerning the sound development and utilization of coral reef resources The focus of this project will be primarily on the coral reef reserve area of Cayos Cochinos with secondary activities on Roatan There are two reasons for this focus beyond budgetary considerations First Cayos Cochinos was more heavily impacted by Hurricane Mitch especially by runoff from the northern coast of Honduras than the other Bay Islands Second there are several other groups gathering information for Roatan Guanaja and Utila that are perceived to have overlapping interests and can provide information to this project In contrast the USGS is the only group working with Honduran coastal resource managers in the Cayos Cochinos Reserve Although most of the work will be conducted in Cayos Cochinos some comparisons will be made to Roatan reefs which suffered much less damage from the hurricane Cooperating Agencies http coral aoml noaa gov agra field honduras html Honduras Coral Reef Fund Dr Adoni Cubas http www

water temperature These instruments will provide enough data to understand the temperature fluctuations from tidal to annual scales Changes in temperature light intensity and salinity will be included in the post Hurricane Mitch research concerning the vitality of the coral reef ecosystem cochino jpg 4875 Bytes Cochino Pequeno largest island in aerial photograph and the smaller islands in the region are all surrounded by coral reefs in various stages of health The Cayos Cochinos island chain including Pequeno is located nine miles off the northern coast of Honduras Hurricane Mitch inundated this area of the Bay Islands with sediment contamination and fresh water from the mainland which may be responsible for some of the coral degradation Graphic thermographs installed The marine resources of the Cayos Cochinos Marine Reserve experienced negative as well as positive effects as a result of Hurricane Mitch Monitoring efforts and data interpretation will provide vital information to the Honduran resource managers and the general public on the impacts associated with Hurricane Mitch and to the continuing environmental changes GPS thermographs installed USGS researchers collecting GPS locations on Cochino Pequeqo GPS coordinates are collected at distinctive features on the island and positioned on an aerial photograph in order to rectify i e flatten the image The rectified image is then formatted with GIS mapping capabilities The resulting map will provide a database of terrestrial and marine resources for local managers and researchers img src

after Hurricane Mitch passed over northern Honduras The red yellow and green colors along the coast depict turbidity concentration levels Excessive rainfall from Mitch increased runoff on land and the rivers increased in the volume of water amount of sediment and quantity of debris in the river water images coral10big jpg click for a larger image The shallow waters around Cochino Peque o and the rest of the Bay Islands are ideal for coral reef development However strong storm and hurricane induced surges are responsible for destruction to coral reef environments which may have been the cause for this broken and overturned branching coral Acropora palmata images coral1big jpg click for a larger image Two Sea Bird data loggers were successfully installed on the shallow reef 6 m one at Cayos Cochinos and the other at Roat n These loggers will record temperature salinity and light as photosynthetically active radiation PAR These instruments will assist in identifying variables that can affect the health of reef corals such as upwelling events and fresh water input and increased sediment loading from the mainland images coral2big jpg click for a larger image The aftermath of Hurricane Mitch on November 1 1998 This satellite image is courtesy of the SeaWiFS Project NASA GSFC and ORBIMAGE Data was collected at the University of South Florida Note the turbid waters along the north coast of Honduras on account of the excessive runoff and high fresh water river discharge i e the Agu n River as a result of the hurricane s elevated rainfall images coral3big jpg click for a

limited to poor land and river management municipal and industrial pollution urban sewage agricultural chemicals excavation and dredging Algae proliferate in nutrient rich waters and blanket the preexisting corals Often times the algae will out compete the reef builders images coral4big jpg click for a larger image Underwater digital video recordings and photography provide important tools for documenting the status of the coral reef ecosystem at a particular period of time Time series archives of specific reefs assist researchers in documenting the decline or improvement of those reefs affected by major storms and hurricanes or other forms of environmental perturbations images coral5big jpg click for a larger image Coinciding with the warm summer months is an increase in coral living tissue necrosis disease Some of the more prevalent diseases are black band observed above white band yellow band yellow blotch white plague and dark spot An increase in run off and contamination may be partly responsible for the high number of diseased coral heads observed the summer following Hurricane Mitch images Cayos archipelago map jpg map of the cayos archipelago Aerial

between that collected by the students at the end of the dock Cayos Peque o and the study site at Pelican Point Cayos Grande Water sampled at Pelican Point is from approximately 5 m 17 ft water depth and that collected by the students was approximately 0 5 m 1 5 ft water depth at the dock The data correspond very well except that the surface salinity at the dock observed freshened water sooner than at the deeper site However the large pulses of fresher water are detected almost simultaneously during the second week of August 2000 images coralsea9big gif click for a larger image Comparison

coralsea10big gif click for a larger image Comparison of temperature data 5 m water depth 17 ft between Cayos Cochinos and Roat n Trends are very similar however Cayos tends to be slightly warmer than Roat n This may be a result from the fact that Cayos is situated on a shallow shelf and Roat n is surrounded by deep water Surface water is warmed quicker in shallow seas images coralsea11big gif click for a larger image Comparison of salinity data 5 m water depth 17 ft between Cayos Cochinos and Roat n Salinity is very similar between sites except for the magnitude of events that may input fresher water Since Cayos is situated closer to the mainland it is often subjected to plumes of river discharge which might be reflected in these data Roat n is primarily subjected to local runoff
