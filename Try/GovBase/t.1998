Nevada were deposited in San Francisco Bay Gilbert 1917 Jaffe et al 1998 Capiella et al 1999 This rapid deposition also choked river systems and deposited mercury contaminated sediments in the rivers and Bay Hydraulic mining was stopped in 1884 by a California Supreme Court decision Deposition in the Bay slowed in the late 1800 s and early 1900 s as a result of this decrease in sediment supply Jaffe et al 1998 Capiella et al 1999 During the mid 1900 s sediment supply was further reduced by water works projects dams diversions etc creating an erosional system in the study area by the late 1900 s The re working of these sediments poses environmental and biological concerns regarding mercury in the bay The location of these deposits is important for understanding the health of the bay waters In March 2000 the U S Geological Survey collected sediment cores in the study area to determine the location of mercury contaminated hydraulic mining debris The study area Figure 1 comprises 400 km2 and consists of San Pablo Bay and Suisun Bay both of which are part of the San Francisco Bay estuary Grizzly Bay Figure 1 a subembayment of Suisun Bay is also part of the study area For the purpose of this report the term Suisun Bay will be used collectively for both areas The present channel system in Suisun Bay links bathy html Figure 2 179 kb JPEG is composed of three channels that flow through the bay The primary channel runs in the southern section of Suisun Bay A smaller channel flows between Roe Island and Ryer Island The deepest channel flows through Suisun Cutoff north of Ryer Island and past Grizzly Bay All three channels join at Carquinez Strait where they continue through the southern section of San Pablo Bay and into San Francisco Bay The average depths in San Pablo and Suisun Bays at mean sea level are 3 7 m and 5 8 m respectively Smith et al 2002 This report documents preliminary analyses conducted on a subset of the cores collected on the March 2000 cruise Field and laboratory methods used to analyze the cores are described Field core descriptions core X radiographs classification of stratigraphy from X radiographs and magnetic susceptibility are presented in the data section This research was supported by USGS San Francisco Bay Place Based Studies and the USGS Toxics Program Many people helped collect the cores presented in this report Gordon Smith Institute for Marine Science at UC Santa Cruz and Captain of the RV David Johnson operated the boat and winches with great skill to make core collection as easy as possible Walt Olsen USGS was the Marine Technician for the cruise Roberto Anima USGS has collected many cores from SF Bay and taught us the fine points of and assisted in core collection Ryan Leech USGS helped prepare a sample strategy organize volunteers and collected cores Kathy Presto USGS was navigator and assisted in collecting cores Richard Smith and Jim Lugosi USGS also assisted in core collection Mark Marvin DiPasquale and Jennifer Agee USGS helped with collection and sampling of box cores Anja Boelm a UC Santa Cruz graduate student logged cores aboard the RV David Johnson Heather Little and Alexa La Plante UC Santa Cruz students assisted in core collection top TOP OF PAGE METHODS The coring locations were chosen in both erosional areas where mining deposits are either absent or suspected to be at the surface and in regions where the debris is suspected to be buried Jaffe et al 1999 Field core collection handling and describing and laboratory X radiographs description of X radiographs and magnetic susceptibility methods are described below Core Collection and Handling links figue3 html Rich Smith aboard the RV David Johnston in San Pablo Bay March 2000 Figure 3 Rich Smith aboard the RV

and gravity cores Both types were collected using USGS coring equipment The dimensions of the box corer is 30 cm wide 20 cm deep and 45 cm high The 9 cm in diameter gravity cores were collected using an 800 lb weight and 3 m long barrel After collection gravity cores were cut in 1 5 m sections to facilitate transport and storage Each section was capped Initially cores were stored upright onboard the Johnston to allow sediments to solidify in an attempt to minimize disruption of stratigraphy during transport Later gravity cores were transported horizontally and stored horizontally in a large refrigerator at 3 8 C Box cores were sub sampled immediately after coming onboard Sub sampling included taking sediment cores with gravity core liners and slabs Slabs 20 cm wide 22 44 cm long and 3 cm thick were taken by pressing a plexiglass form into the side of the box core after careful removal of one of the box core walls Sub samples were also stored in a refrigerator at 3 8 C top TOP OF PAGE Field Descriptions of Cores Gravity cores were described onboard immediately after cutting the core These descriptions are based on observations through core liners augmented by observations of sediment at section ends and in the core catcher The field descriptions were compiled in a table and include the setting geographic coordinates notes on the coring process and description of material in both the core catcher and the cores X Radiographs Each gravity core was X rayed as a whole core using X ray equipment on the USGS Menlo Park campus The 1 5 m long core sections were typically X rayed in 30 40 cm increments with 5 20 cm of overlap between X rays We used 60kV 20mA of radiation per scan The box cores were X rayed using the Faxitron X ray system designed for slabs and short cores also located on the Menlo Park campus The X rays were then developed using on site developing equipment X radiographs were then scanned and edited to enhance contrast Descriptions of X Radiographs The X radiographs were described using a light table and by creating categories for stratification and shell appearance The stratification categories separate massive distinctly laminated moderately laminated and faintly laminated regions in the core The different shell categories distinguish disarticulated shell fragments and articulated shells A color code links figure4 html Figure 4 28 kb JPEG was then applied to each category for graphing and comparing with the magnetic susceptibility data Magnetic Susceptibility Magnetic susceptibility testing was performed on the gravity cores using a GEOTEK multi sensor core logger on the Menlo Park campus Measurements were taken every 1 cm of core using the small magnetic coil 133 mm in diameter In preparation for the analysis the core liner was thoroughly cleaned all tape was removed from the end caps and the cores were allowed to come to room temperature The logger data is output in real time to a software program where the data is displayed graphically and saved in a spreadsheet The data was then graphed and combined with the X ray description color codes described above Preliminary Results The data for each core consists of a table of field descriptions scanned images of the X radiographs and a magnetic susceptibility and X ray description chart An example of each analysis technique is provided below for reference To

the top of GC 1 Many of our X radiographs show burrows like this one in the upper portion approximately 15 cm of the core The burrows appear as dark grey lines cross cutting the layers in the core Alternating mud and sand layers are also visible throughout the core Sandier layers are more dense and appear lighter in color while mud rich sediment appears darker in color on the X ray The arrows

links figure6 html 73 kb JPEG Figure 6 shows higher magnetic susceptibilities in the upper 70 cm than in the lower 210 cm A comparison with the color coded description bars on the right suggests a fairly massive region in the upper half of the core with faint laminations throughout Shell fragments are concentrated in the upper half of the core The sharp changes in magnetic value that occur at the top and bottom of each core segment are due to end effects Sudden drops in magnetic values within the core segments above example at 200 cm are due to cracks in the core REFERENCES Capiella K
