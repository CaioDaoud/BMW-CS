Integrating Science into the Design of the Tortugas Ecological Reserve Benjamin D Cowie Haskell Stellwagen Bank National Marine Sanctuary Joanne M Delaney Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary Description The Tortugas Ecological Reserve the largest fully protected marine reserve in the U S A was implemented in July 2001 after a successful three year collaborative effort A key facet of this process was the direct involvement of scientists and the acceptance of their information by the various stakeholders collaborating on the reserve s design This paper describes how scientific information was ultimately influential in the siting and sizing of the reserve Case studies such as this may benefit those attempting to use science to inform decisions in marine protected area planning Location library national integratingscience pdf http sanctuaries nos noaa gov library national integratingscience pdf 960K Responsibly Watching California s Marine Wildlife A Handbook for

Sanctuaries National Marine Sanctuary Program and NOAA Damage Assessment Center Description The National Marine Sanctuaries Act allows the National Marine Sanctuary Program NMSP to issue special use permits SUPs for specific activities within a national marine sanctuary If a SUP is issued the NMSA also authorizes the NMSP to collect fees for the conduct of any activity under a special use permit If a fee is assessed all three of the following fees must be collected 1 the costs incurred or expected to be incurred for issuing the permit 2 fees for activities directly related to the conduct of the permitted activity such as monitoring of the activity and 3 an amount that represents the fair market value of the use of sanctuary resources NOAA economists began drafting a methodology to determine the fair market value fee for these permits in December 1999 A draft report was published in the Federal Register for public comment on two separate occasions first in January 2001 66 FR 1092 and then again in September 2001 66 FR 43135 The final version of this report Fair Market Value Analysis for a Fiber Optic Cable Permit in National Marine Sanctuaries describes various methodologies used to assess fair market value including income approach future income from the cable installation is allocated to the right of way and discounted to the present and the willing buyer and seller scenario incentives and bargaining position of parties to a theoretical negotiation process are analyzed Ultimately the authors of the report recommend that the analysis of previous right of way transactions comparison of existing fair market valuation methodologies serve as the basis for assessment of fair market value for cable permits in sanctuaries which is consistent with the methods most commonly used in the private sector to evaluate rights of way This is the final version of the report and no comments are sought by the NMSP For a more detailed history of the fair market value methodology development process the responses to comments on the report and information on next steps for the NMSP please refer to the Federal Register notice announcing the availability of the

Beuttler M R Haflich J Delaney B L Richards and E Franklin Description The National Ocean Service of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration working in cooperation with the State of Florida the Gulf of Mexio Fishery Management Council and the National Marine Fisheries Service proposes to establish a 151 square nautical mile no take ecological reserve to protect the critical coral reef ecosystem of the Tortugas a remote area in the western portion of the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary FKNMS The reserve would consist of two sections Tortugas North and Tortugas South and would require an expansion of the sanctuary boundary to protect important coral reef resources in the areas of Sherwood Forest and Riley s Hump An ecological reserve in the Tortugas will preserve the richness of species and health of fish stocks in the Tortugas and throughout the Florida Keys helping to ensure the stability of commercial and recreational fisheries The reserve will protect important spawning areas for snapper and grouper as well as valuable deep water habitat for other commercial species Restrictions on vessel discharge and anchoring will protect water quality and habitat complexity The reserve s geographic isolation will help scientists distinguish between natural and human caused changes to the coral reef environment Location http sanctuaries nos noaa gov

California Bight Catherin A Schwemm L A K Mertes and B Waltenberger Description The use of Geographic Information Systems GIS in all areas of natural resource management planning has significantly increased within the last decade Within the Southern California Bight and on the Channel Islands many natural and anthropogenic phenomena ccur or exist over large areas and are within the purview of several jurisdictional entities The distribution of wide ranging species and the locations of offshore energy development facilities are examples of subjects of interest to many agencies and are particularly suitable for GIS analysis and interpretation Until recently however there has been no coordinated effort to share and distribute spatial data or plan for future data development Many of the groups involved in GIS development in this region have recently initiated discussions regarding efforts to improve communication and data sharing between local agencies organizations and educational entities This paper describes the current status of efforts to address several needs in the area of interagency GIS coordination including the creation of a centralized spatial data clearinghouse and the necessity of having a designated full time position to coordinate efforts between cooperating agencies Clearly the establishment of such an infrastructure will require a dynamic approach to funding and maintenance Location http sanctuaries nos noaa gov library CI waltenberger pdf http sanctuaries nos noaa gov library CI waltenberger pdf A Rapid Assessment of Coral Fish and Algae Using the AGRRA Protocol Christy Pattengill Semmens S R Gittings and T Shyka Description The Flower Garden Banks are topographic features on the edge of the continental shelf in the northwest Gulf of Mexico These banks are approximately 175 km southeast of Galveston TX at 28 north latitude and support the northernmost coral reefs on the North American continental shelf The East and West Flower Garden Banks EFG and WFG and Stetson Bank a smaller sandstone bank approximately 110 km offshore are managed and protected as the Flower Garden Banks National Marine Sanctuary FGBNMS As part of a regionwide initiative to assess coral reef condition the benthic and fish communities of the EFG and WFG were assessed using the Atlantic and Gulf Rapid Reef Assessment AGRRA protocol The AGRRA survey was conducted during a week long cruise in August 1999 that was jointly sponsored by the FGBNMS and the Reef Environmental Education Foundation REEF A total of 25 coral transects 132 algal quadrants 24 fish transects and 26 Roving Diver REEF surveys were conducted These surveys revealed reefs with high coral cover dominated by large healthy corals little macroalgae and healthy fish populations The percent live coral cover was 53 9 and 48 8 at the WFG and EFG respectively and the average colony diameter was 93 and 81 cm Fish diversity was lower than most Caribbean reefs but large abundances and size of many species reflected the low fishing pressure on the banks The benthic and fish assemblages at the EFG and WFG were similar Due to its near pristine condition the FGB data will prove to be a valuable component in the AGRRA database and its resulting scale of reef condition for the region Location http sanctuaries nos noaa gov library National conseriesAGRRA pdf http

the general decline in the health of marine ecosystems The human impacts on marine ecosystems are forcing resource agencies and scientists to rethink how society manages ocean and coastal systems Since the 1960s an ecosystem based approach to management and restoration has developed within state and federal resource agencies With new data and insights an ecosystem approach has been embraced by the Executive Office of the White House and 18 federal agencies Similar views are increasingly evident at state and local government levels as well as within the nongovernmental sector With the Channel Islands as a backdrop this paper analyzes the role of science and values in the development of an ecosystem based approach to marine systems Even at the purely technical level an ecosystem approach will require an integrated and adaptive approach that recognizes the social cultural economic historical ecological and biogeographical character of particular marine systems Location http
