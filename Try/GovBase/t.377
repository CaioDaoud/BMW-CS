Helping Doctors and Patients John Edwards The People s Senator Helping Doctors and Patients The rising cost of malpractice insurance for doctors is getting in the way of good health care In rural areas some specialists can no longer afford to practice and patients can t get the care they need We need to fix this problem now and we need to fix it in a way that is consistent with the doctors own Hippocratic Oath First do no harm Unfortunately President Bush s proposed prescription comes straight off the insurance companies wish list a sharp limit on the compensation these companies have to pay children and parents who have been blinded paralyzed or otherwise severely injured The victims who make the least money will suffer the most under this plan The harm to the kinds of families I represented as a lawyer for nearly 20 years will be enormous What the president s proposal won t do is work Insurance premiums have spiked recently because of insurance companies losses on their investments not their losses to victims In fact about half the states already have some limits on victim compensation yet premiums in states with caps average about the same as premiums in states without caps California finally controlled rates not by attacking victims that didn t work but by reforming the insurance industry and rolling back premium increases We need a real solution that frees doctors from crippling insurance costs without preventing the most injured victims from receiving the compensation they deserve That real solution has three elements Most important we need to crack down on price gouging by the industry We also need aggressive action against frivolous lawsuits that don t belong in court not against the serious lawsuits that bring help to the most injured And finally we need to reduce the number of medical errors many made by a very small fraction of the medical profession The most critical step is reforming the insurance industry Today insurance companies use slow and burdensome processes to discourage both doctors and patients from filing legitimate claims Worse still these companies can fix prices and divvy up the country in order to drive up their profits Even when companies don t explicitly collude they set their rates based on a trade group loss calculation that they know other companies will follow In any other industry this kind of conduct would be subject to scrutiny under the antitrust laws But an obscure 1945 law gives insurance companies a broad antitrust exemption Because of the insurance lobby s influence Congress has even blocked the Federal Trade Commission from investigating insurance company rip offs These special privileges must go Next we need to prevent and punish frivolous lawsuits Most lawyers are responsible advocates for their clients but the few who aren t hurt the real victims undercut the credibility of the legal system and clog our courts For all his talk about frivolous lawsuits President Bush does nothing to address them He s got it backwards instead of cracking down on irresponsible behavior and baseless cases he s targeting serious victims who win in court and are believed by juries Before a lawyer can bring a medical malpractice case to court we should require that he or she swear that an expert doctor is ready to testify that real malpractice has occurred Lawyers who file frivolous cases should face tough mandatory sanctions Lawyers who file three frivolous cases should be forbidden from bringing another suit for the next 10 years in other words three strikes and you re out Finally we can reduce malpractice premiums by helping to reduce malpractice The Institute of Medicine found that at least 44 000 people die from preventable medical errors every year In medicine as in law a few people cause the most problems Only 5 percent of doctors have paid malpractice claims more than once since 1990 This same 5 percent is responsible for over half of all claims paid One part of the problem is state medical boards whose discipline is as lax as state bar associations We need to provide resources and incentives for boards to adopt real standards on the three strikes model At the same time we need to encourage doctors to report more medical errors voluntarily so we can learn more about systemic problems Together these measures will give relief to most doctors who are suffering under the staggering weight of insurance premiums But where premiums still cause shortages of medical care Washington must provide a temporary subsidy so good doctors can continue their essential work We shouldn t pad insurers profits and hurt people who have already suffered immensely as the president proposes But we should protect good doctors and the patients who depend on them Back to Previous Page
