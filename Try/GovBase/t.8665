Registry ATSDR is a federal public health agency with headquarters in Atlanta Georgia and 10 regional offices in the United States ATSDR s mission is to serve the public by using the best science taking responsive public health actions and providing trusted health information to prevent harmful exposures and diseases related to toxic substances ATSDR is not a regulatory agency unlike the U S Environmental Protection Agency EPA which is the federal agency that develops and enforces environmental laws to protect the environment and human health This glossary defines words used by ATSDR in communications with the public It is not a complete dictionary of environmental health terms If you have questions or comments call ATSDR s toll free telephone number 1 888 42 ATSDR 1 888 422 8737

work with ATSDR to gather and review community health concerns provide information on how people might have been or might now be exposed to hazardous substances and inform ATSDR on ways to involve the community in its activities Comparison value CV Calculated concentration of a substance in air water food or soil that is unlikely to cause harmful adverse health effects in exposed people The CV is used as a screening level during the public health assessment process Substances found in amounts greater than their CVs might be selected for further evaluation in the public health assessment process Completed exposure pathway see Exposure Pathway exposure pathway Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 CERCLA CERCLA also known as Superfund is the federal law that concerns the removal or cleanup of hazardous substances in the environment and at hazardous waste sites ATSDR which was created by CERCLA is responsible for assessing health issues and supporting public health activities related to hazardous waste sites or other environmental releases of hazardous substances This law was later amended by the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act SARA Concentration The amount of a substance present in a certain amount of soil water air food blood hair urine breath or any other media Contaminant A substance that is either present in an environment where it does not belong or is present at levels that might cause harmful adverse health effects Delayed health effect A disease

Energy Dose for chemicals that are not radioactive The amount of a substance to which a person is exposed over some time period Dose is a measurement of exposure Dose is often expressed as milligram amount per kilogram a measure of body weight per day a measure of time when people eat or drink contaminated water food or soil In general the greater the dose the greater the likelihood of an effect An exposure dose is how much of a substance is encountered in the environment An absorbed dose is the amount of a substance that actually got into the body through the eyes skin stomach intestines or lungs Dose for radioactive chemicals The radiation dose is the amount of energy from radiation that is actually absorbed by the body This is not the same as measurements of the amount of radiation in the environment Dose response relationship The relationship between the amount of exposure Dose dose to a substance and the resulting changes in body function or health response Environmental media
