Jacob V Maizel Jr Ph D Chief The activities of the Laboratory Experimental and Computational Biology LECB fall into several broad areas macromolecular structure and function membrane structure and function immunology phamacokinetics and computational and modeling methodology The work is both theoretical and experimental Application of theoretical understanding to these biological systems is accomplished through the use of advanced computing Many of the theoretical studies are possible only through use of the supercomputing facilities at the Advanced Biomedical Computing Center FCRDC which was created and sponsored through the initiative of the Laboratory of Experimental and Computational Biology The Laboratory oversees the development and operation of the contractor operated The http www abcc ncifcrf gov ABCC which serves as the only public domain supercomputing center dedicated to biomedical research in the world Access is provided to suitable applicants from the biomedical community on the basic of scientific priority as evaluated by a time allocation group made up of representatives from the NCI other NIH Institutes and the extramural community The goal is to provide access for challenging computational biology problems to proven easy to use fast reliable efficient high performance computers The computing environment is centered around MIMD supercomputers and scalar parallel machines A fiber optic network interconnects these platforms and provides Internet access and high speed connections to a userbase of more than 1600 researchers The Laboratory of Experimental and Computational Biology is divided into the following sections Office of the Chief Jacob V Maizel Jr Ph D Chief index ips html Image Processing Section jmaizel maizel html Jacob Maizel
