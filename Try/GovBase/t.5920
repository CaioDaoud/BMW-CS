USGS Water Resources U S GEOLOGICAL SURVEY A DEVILS HOLE PRIMER by J M Landwehr and I J Winograd What is Devils Hole Devils Hole is a tectonic cave developed in the discharge zone of a regional aquifer in south central Nevada The walls of this predominantly subaqueous cavern are coated with dense vein calcite The stable isotopic content of the calcite provides a 500 000 year record of variations in temperature and other paleoclimatic parameters See Winograd et al 1992 and Riggs et al 1994 What do the stable isotopic records represent The Devils Hole d18O record is an indicator of paleotemperature and corresponds in timing and magnitude to paleo SST sea surface temperature recorded in Pacific Ocean sediments off the California and Oregon coasts The record is also highly correlated with major variations in temperature in the Vostok ice core from the East Antarctic plateau The d13C record is thought to reflect changes in global variations in the ratio of stable carbon isotopes of atmospheric CO2 and or changes in the density of vegetation in the groundwater recharge areas tributary to Devils Hole See Winograd et al 1996 Herbert et al 2001 Winograd 2002 Winograd et al 1997 Landwehr and Winograd 2001 Landwehr 2002 and Coplen et al 1994 Are the Devils Hole ages accurate How was the vein calcite dated As eminent a geochemist as W Broecker has stated that the Devils Hole chronology is the best we have Since 1992 all core material has been uranium series dated using thermal ionization mass spectrometric TIMS methodology In 1997 the Devils Hole Thorium 230 dates were independently confirmed by non USGS investigators using Protactinium 231 See Broecker 1992 Ludwig et al 1992 Winograd et al 1997 and Edwards et al 1997 Is there still an inconsistency between the Devils Hole record and the Milankovitch hypothesis Yes The Milankovitch hypothesis holds that the timing and duration of the Pleistocene ice ages are a direct consequence of variations in solar insolation occurring at the latitude of 65 North in response to changes in the precession obliquity and eccentricity of the Earth s orbit The 500 000 year Devils Hole d18O record presents four challenges to this theory with respect to the timing of the penultimate glacial interglacial transition the duration of the interglacial climates the apparent non stationarity of paleoclimatic time series and the occurrence of a well developed glacial interglacial cycle at a time 450 000 350 000 years ago when orbital theory indicates that none should occur Numerous discussions of the implications of the Devils Hole record to the Milankovitch hypothesis have been published since 1992 most addressing the first challenge listed above However uranium series dating of corals that mark past sea level high stands has shown that the penultimate glacial interglacial transition occurred by about 136 000 years ago a finding irreconcilable with the Milankovitch hypothesis even as modified by Crowley and Kim 1994 The three remaining challenges listed above have yet to receive detailed attention A recent overview of this controversy appeared in the June 23 2000 issue of Science See Winograd et al 1992 Crowley and Kim 1994 Winograd et al 1996 Winograd et al 1997 Henderson and Slowey 2000 Gallup et al 2002 Muhs et al 2002 and Karner and Muller 2000 How long can we expect the present interglaciation to last No one knows for sure In the Devils Hole record the last four interglaciations lasted over 20 000 years with the warmest portion being a relatively stable period of 10 000 to 15 000 years duration This is consistent with what is seen in the Vostok ice core from Antarctica and several records of sea level high stand and would suggest that an equally long duration should be inferred for the current interglacial period as well Work in progress on Devils Hole data for the period 60 000 to 5 000 years ago indicates that current interglacial temperature conditions may have already persisted for 17 000 years Other workers have suggested that the current interglaciation might last tens of thousands of years See Winograd et al 1997 Muhs et al 2002 and Paillard 2001 Why should anyone but a scientist care about this topic In addition to providing information about the possible duration of our present interglacial climate discussed above research in Devils Hole has provided valuable information for water managers about recharge rates in the principal aquifer in south central Nevada Precise information about paleoclimates also provides information needed for evaluation of the potential suitability of Yucca Mountain Nevada for the disposal of nuclear wastes See Szabo et al 1994 Forester et al 1999 and Thomas Winograd and Coplen 1996 Where can I see the
