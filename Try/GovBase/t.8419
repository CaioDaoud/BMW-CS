not provide a referral service for consumers who need to choose a doctor However the following information may help you make a choice If you have health insurance the first place to check is with your insurer or your employer s benefits office Many insurance plans now limit your choice to a list of doctors who agree to certain requirements Many plans also require you to select a primary care physician PCP from their list The PCP is then responsible for your care and must make any necessary referrals to specialists or other health professionals If you are not limited to a list of doctors most physicians are listed in the telephone yellow pages and in larger communities they are listed by specialty For your main physician you should consider a Family Physician or Internal Medicine Specialist Internist you also may want to choose an Obstetrician Gynecologist if you are a woman or a Pediatrician for your children All of these doctors are considered primary care practitioners in that they can provide overall management of your health care If you are elderly and have conditions associated with aging you may want to seek a specialist in geriatrics as your PCP Regardless be sure your insurance will cover the doctor s services before you incur any charges You may want to talk with friends or co workers about physicians they like If this is not feasible most county medical societies will give you names of physicians in your area who are in the specialty you select Look in the white pages for your county medical society or association Once you have some names call the doctors and ask if they are accepting new patients Be sure to ask whether they will accept your insurance plan insurance plan lists often are outdated as physicians are added or deleted from the plan Ideally you should meet the physician and discuss your health concerns while you are well This may be a good time to have history and physical examination performed but again make sure your insurance will cover it Most plans will not cover an informal visit just to get acquainted Before you make an appointment call the Medical Board to verify that the doctor has a current California license Also ask if there have been any disciplinary actions or if any charges are pending This service is available by calling 916 263 2382 For more information http www medbd ca gov licenseVer htm Physician License Information Before You Go Before your initial visit to a new doctor make a list of things you want to tell him or her about your health history Many offices will ask you to fill out a form and may want details about surgeries you have had and when they occurred current conditions for which you are being treated prescription drugs you take You may want to bring the bottles so you will have correct information about strength and dosages name and address of your previous doctor s person to contact in an emergency your employer s address and phone number your insurance company and policy number If you have an insurance I D card be sure to bring it family medical history Questions A very important step is to make and take with you a list of questions you want answered These may include the doctor s specialty or special areas of practice who covers the doctor s patients when he or she is not available whether other physicians or non physicians such as a nurse practitioner or physician assistant will participate in your care and whether this is optional special training the doctor may have in managing any medical conditions you have such as diabetes heart disease high blood pressure etc whether the doctor will provide care for others in your family to what hospitals he or she can admit patients if there are any restrictions on the doctor s hospital privileges It is important that your doctor is able to admit you to a hospital if you need inpatient care If he or she does not have admitting privileges make sure you understand how hospitalizations will be handled After Your Initial Visit You should feel that you were treated courteously that all your questions were answered and that you were not rushed or dismissed Your relationship with a doctor is one of the most intimate in life you should be able to trust him or her with the most private situations or problems and should feel that your doctor is your ally After the initial visit if you are satisfied with what you experienced great If not remember the choice is yours Try another doctor It is your health that is at stake The Medical Board has a pamphlet titled Services to Consumers from the Medical Board of California which contains more detailed information about choosing a doctor checking on licensure and how you can get help if you believe your doctor has done something wrong For information
