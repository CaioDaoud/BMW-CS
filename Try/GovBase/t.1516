mil tpep library rainbow Rainbow Series The rainbow series is a library of about 37 documents that address specific areas of computer security Each of the documents is a different color which is how they became to be refereed to as the Rainbow Series The primary document of the set is the Trusted Computer System Evaluation Criteria 5200 28 STD Orange Book dated December 26 1985 This document defines the seven different levels of trust that a product can achieve under the Trusted Product Evaluation Program TPEP within NSA Some of the titles include Password Management Audit Discretionary Access Control Trusted Network Interpretation Configuration Management Identification and Authentication Object Reuse and Covert Channels A new International criteria for system and product evaluation called the International Common Criteria ICCC has been developed for product evaluations The TCSEC has been largely superceded by the International Common Criteria but is still used for products that require a higher level of assurance in specific operational environments Most of the rainbow series documents are available on line Last updated December 13 2002 Page created February 23 2001 http www
