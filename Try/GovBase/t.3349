Blue Cloud Abbey in Marvin S D The USGS uncovered 337 glass plate negatives featuring Native Americans from the late 1800s to early 1900s however the negatives had deteriorated almost beyond restoration The USGS is now in the process of restoring scanning and printing these historical photographic records of the northern Great Plains These photos are part of a collection of more than 50 000 images that Benedictine monks gathered as they traveled through Dakota Territory ministering to tribal communities These photos although taken at a later date provide a crucial insight into the landscapes and cultures that the Lewis and Clark expedition would have encountered along the Missouri River and they also provide a valuable historical tool to Native American tribes A collection of 28 of these historical Native American photos are featured below http www usgs gov features images native americans 1 gif A group of Native American police officers from Ft Thompson S D Crow Creek
