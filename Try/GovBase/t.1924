staff involved in the ASCI supported Center for Simulating the Dynamic Response of Materials at the California Institute of Technology The Caltech Center is developing a virtual shock physics test facility in which the full three dimensional response of a variety of target materials can be computed for a wide range of compressive tensional and shear loadings including those loadings produced by detonation of energetic materials More information about the caltech asci 03 html CalTech ASCI Center of Excellence visit September 27 2002 Pentagon 9 11 Remembrance Event The LLESA Piecemakers NG will offer employees a unique look at the impact of September 11 on the Pentagon A speaker from the Pentagon renovation the Phoenix Project will share the exciting story of courage and dedication that

for graduate students to explore and learn some of the cutting edge methods in computational materials sciences computational chemistry and other related areas of computational science during their first few years of graduate study Each student will spend eight weeks at LLNL as the guest of an LLNL host scientist working on a computational project in the host s area of expertise In addition the students will take short courses presented by the leading professors and scientists covering state of the art and emerging computational methods while focusing on the practical aspects of their numerical implementation top Back to top April 7 2003 UCRL WEB 150245 http www universityofcalifornia edu welcomenf html UC http www nnsa doe gov http www llnl gov LLNL NNSA http www cms llnl gov
