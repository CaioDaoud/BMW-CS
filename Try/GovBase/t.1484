ten Brink Chief Scientist http woodshole er usgs gov U S Geological Survey There have been surprisingly few expeditions to the Puerto Rico trench during the past 25 years despite its fascinating and mysterious origin and its hazard to Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands Our technical capabilities to explore the oceans have improved tremendously during that period The NOAA Office of Ocean Exploration identified the Puerto Rico trench as a prime exploration target and funded two exploration expeditions to map the trench and its vicinity Mapping was conducted by the U S Geological Survey USGS in cooperation with NOAA University of New Hampshire Center for Coastal Mapping and NOAA NOS Office of Coast Survey aboard the NOAA ship technology vessels ronbrown ronbrown html Ronald H Brown Multibeam bathymetry and acoustic back scatter data were acquired for a total of 27 days covering an area of approximately 22 700 square nautical miles summary media summary html Mapping data over the course of several days This image depicts data acquired and processed for the first six days of the second leg of the cruise to demonstrate the time involved in mapping a very deep region of the ocean Click image for larger view The survey was unusual in both its scope and its water depth An entire tectonic province of the Earth was mapped Most of the trench floor and its vicinity are covered by only a thin layer of sediments Therefore the picture emerging in these maps represents the deformation created by the large plate tectonic forces The pattern of deformation is used to assess the seismic and tsunami hazards of the area Several major discoveries were made Among them are 1 The deepest part of the Atlantic lies at a depth of almost 8400 meters 5 2 miles It is an elongate depression 280 km 175 miles long and is very flat 2 The North American tectonic plate which lies north of the trench is descending under Puerto Rico and the Virgin Island blocks south of the trench There are large submarine slides on the downgoing plate suggesting that the bottom of the trench had deepened lately see trench trench html Trench essay for details 3 The southern side of the trench north of Puerto Rico is covered with a tilted limestone layer The top of this layer is very smooth with the exception of narrow deep gullies The deep edge of the layer is jagged showing evidence of large scale slumping Several cracks have been detected near the edge which suggest that the process of slumping continues at present summary media bunce html Presenting Dr Bunce with images of the Bunce fault Dr Uri ten Brink presents Dr Elizabeth Betty Bunce with a colorful poster with maps and images of the fault bearing her name during a small ceremony earlier this year Also present were Hartley Hoskins Dave Du Bois and Dicky Allison of WHOI and Dan Blackwood of the USGS Click image for larger view 4 A large fault system which is similar to the San Andreas Fault in California was discovered in very deep water near the trench Much of the horizontal sliding between the North American and Caribbean plates occurs along this fault The fault was named after Dr Elizabeth Betty Bunce a marine geophysicist pioneer who investigated this challenging environment in the 1950s 5 Bunce Fault is located 115 km north of Puerto Rico Previous interpretations placed active strike slip faults as close as 55 km from the northern coast of Puerto Rico which would have imposed a greater seismic hazard to Puerto Rico In addition the Bunce Fault passes through an area of relatively low bathymetric relief which is less prone to large seismically activated submarine slides than faults crossing the steep slope north of Puerto Rico 6 However Bunce Fault interacts with other fault systems to the NE and the NW of Puerto Rico producing high rates of seismicity and a dramatic topography 7 A mud volcano which spewed saturated mud to a distance of 10 km was discovered at a depth of 7900 meters 8 The North American plate which descends into the trench is broken into steps with vertical offsets of 0 5 1 km and is sheared parallel to the trench It is unusual for deformation in the descending slab to so extensive These exciting results form the basis for additional expeditions that will investigate specific features of the seafloor by means of submersibles and remotely operated vehicles summary media 1 html 3 D view of scarp looking south toward Puerto Rico Figure 1 3 D view of the scarp looking south toward Puerto Rico Click image for larger view and more information Submarine Slides North of Puerto Rico Implications for Tsunami Hazard By Uri ten Brink Chief Scientist U S Geological Survey A large amphitheater shaped scarp a line of cliffs produced by faulting or erosion 55 km across is located on the northern insular slope of Puerto Rico 37 km north of the city of Arecibo The scarp was first discovered by the U S Geological Survey USGS during the mapping of the U S Exclusive Economic Zone EEZ in the 1980 s utilizing the GLORIA system a long range side scan sonar Schwab et al 1991 It was interpreted as a giant submarine slide which removed 1500 km2 of the Tertiary layer that was covered by a thick 1300 1500 m sequence of carbonate rocks Figure 1 is a 3 D view of the scarp looking south toward Puerto Rico It took one month in 1990 to generate this single image Much higher resolution images created in near real time from this multibeam bathymetry survey Figure 2 show the morphology of this scarp failure in much greater detail summary media 2 html gray scale image rotated to mimic the viewing angle and lighting direction in Figure 1 regional 3 D view with colors representing depth shows the scarp from a different angle Figure 2a and 2b Two views of the same slide imaged by the multibeam bathymetry method Click image for larger view and more information The scarp was interpreted to represent a large scale slope failure that was probably caused by the tectonic oversteepening of the insular shelf Schwab et al 1991 The carbonate layers which were deposited horizontally near sea level until 3 3 million years ago are now tilted approximately 4 5 degrees to the north reaching a depth of almost 4000 meters near the edge of the scarp The uppermost surface of these carbonate layers appear as a relatively featureless sloping seafloor south of the scarp Figure 2B The slope maintains its angle as it continues upward across the northern shore of Puerto Rico and into the hills above San Juan Until now it was unclear whether the northern insular slope of Puerto Rico continued to tilt and if submarine slides were still active However the newly acquired multibeam data and processed imagery Figure 2 suggest that the slope failure shown in Figure 1 was an initial phase in the landslide process The top portion of the carbonate platform and underlying strata had simply collapsed downslope causing the foot of the slope to steepen This interpretation is supported by the lack of large quantities of slide debris farther north A crack can also be seen continuing eastward below the edge of the carbonate platform Figure 2B and smaller slumps are observed below this crack Additional cracks on the seafloor on the upper left side of Figure 2B appear to isolate a 7x3 km polygon of seafloor at the head of the scarp which is slightly sunken relative to the surrounding area This polygon is interpreted to be an initial slump which may cause a large part of the slope to fail in the future These observations lead us to suggest that slumping along the north slope of Puerto Rico is an active and on going process Submarine slides are known sources for tsunamis the sudden vertical displacement of a large volume of the seafloor during slope failure displaces the overlying water mass generating a tidal wave One such slide in Papua New Guinea the result of the ground shaking by a nearby earthquake in 1998 caused a massive tsunami with more than 2 100 casualties The discoveries reported here stress or emphasize the potential tsunami hazard that could affect the densely populated northern coast of Puerto Rico if another massive slope failure were to occur during an earthquake top top explorations 03trench welcome html Summary Summary explorations 03trench welcome html Summary Summary explorations 03trench
