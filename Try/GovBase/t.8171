submitted brief papers giving their views on issues related to predicting very long term corrosion This publication is a compilation of those submissions Available as meetings passive passive pdf Workshop Proceedings 2 4M Report to the Secretary of Energy and the Congress April 2001 In this report the Board summarizes its major activities in calendar year 2000 During 2000 the Board identified four priority areas for evaluating the potential repository at Yucca Mountain The areas are the following meaningful quantification of conservatisms and uncertainties in the DOE s performance assessments progress in understanding the underlying fundamental processes involved in predicting the rate of waste package corrosion an evaluation and a comparison of the base case repository design with a low temperature design development of multiple lines of evidence to support the safety case of the proposed repository the lines of evidence being derived independently of performance assessment and thus not being subject to the limitations of performance assessment The report summarizes the Board s views on each priority area A more detailed discussion of the priorities can be

the Board summarizes its major activities in calendar year 1999 Among the activities discussed in the report is the Board s 1999 review of the DOE s viability assessment VA of the Yucca Mountain site The Board s evaluation of the VA concludes that Yucca Mountain continues to warrant study as the candidate site for a permanent geologic repository and that work should proceed to support a decision on whether to recommend the site for repository development The Board suggests that the 2001 date for a decision is very ambitious and focused study should continue on natural and engineered barriers The Board states that a credible technical basis does not currently exist for the above boiling repository design included in the VA The Board recommends evaluation of alternative repository designs including lower temperature designs as a potential way to help reduce the significance of uncertainties related to predictions of repository performance Available as 99front pdf Transmittal Letter

Viability Assessment of the Yucca Mountain site including plans to gather information on the amount of water that will eventually seep into repository drifts whether formations under the repository will retard the migration of radionuclides the flow and transport properties of the groundwater that lies approximately 200 meters beneath the repository horizon and long term corrosion rates of materials that may be used for the waste packages The report describes other activities undertaken by the Board in 1998 including a review of the hypothesis that there were hydrothermal upwellings at

Viability Assessment April 1999 In its report the Board offers its views on the DOE s December 1998 Viability Assessment of the Yucca Mountain site in Nevada The Yucca Mountain site is being characterized to determine its suitability as the location of a permanent repository for disposing of spent nuclear fuel and high level radioactive waste The Board discusses the need to address key uncertainties that remain about the site including the performance of the engineered and natural barriers The Board addresses the DOE s plans for reducing those uncertainties and suggests that consideration be given to alternative repository designs including ventilated low temperature designs that have the potential to reduce uncertainties and simplify the analytical bases for determining site suitably and for licensing The Board also comments on the DOE s total system performance assessment the analytical tool that pulls together information on the performance of the repository system

future scientific and technical research under way and planned by the DOE as part of its program for characterizing a site at Yucca Mountain Nevada as a potential repository for spent fuel and high level radioactive waste The Board discusses some of the remaining key scientific and technical uncertainties related to performance of a potential repository The Board s report addresses some of these uncertainties by examining information about the proposed repository system presented to it in meetings and other technical exchanges The Board considers and comments on some of the important

develop alternative design concepts for a repository 2 the need for the DOE to include estimates of the likely variation in doses for alternative candidate critical groups in its interim performance measure for Yucca Mountain 3 the need for the DOE to evaluate whether site specific biosphere data is needed for license application and 4 the need for the DOE to make full and effective use of

March 1996 This special report caps more than two years of study and analysis by the Board into the issues surrounding the need for interim storage of commercial spent nuclear fuel and the advisability and timing of the development of a federal centralized storage facility The Board concludes in the report that the DOE s efforts should remain focused on permanent geologic disposal and the site investigations at Yucca Mountain Nevada that planning for a federal centralized spent fuel storage facility and the required transportation infrastructure be begun now but actual construction delayed until after a site suitability decision is made about the Yucca Mountain site that storage should be developed incrementally that limited emergency backup storage capacity be authorized at an existing nuclear facility and that if the Yucca Mountain site proves unacceptable for repository development other potential sites for both centralized storage and disposal be considered Available as
