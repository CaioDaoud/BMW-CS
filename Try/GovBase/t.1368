Department seeks to allow scientists to address complex and large scale computing and data analysis problems beyond what is possible today The department is developing software components which will operate in a distributed environment The software falls roughly into two categories Middleware providing basic services and capabilities in the nascent DOE Science Grid and Applications and middleware supporting more informal real time collaboration between geographically remote researchers Agenda and Slides for the DSDMeetings homepage html DSD De partment Meetings sc03 DSD Department
