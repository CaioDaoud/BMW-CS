Monitor Program DMP provides data on the price purity and geographic source of heroin being sold at the retail or street level in 23 U S cities The data contained in this report are based on actual undercover heroin purchases made by the DEA on the streets of these cities Since the inception of the DMP the program has documented the rise of heroin purity and the steady decline of its price average price per milligram pure throughout the United States Additionally the DMP has provided information that in the early to mid 1990s clearly showed the infusion of South American heroin into the white powder heroin market Today South America produced heroin dominates the white powder market east of the Mississippi River while Mexican black tar and brown powder heroin clearly dominate the market west of the Mississippi The DMP remains an important assessment and analytical tool for the DEA law enforcement officials drug policy makers and drug abuse researchers throughout the nation Judith E Bertini Acting Assistant Administrator for Intelligence Background The Domestic Monitor Program DMP a retail level heroin purchase program provides data on the price purity and geographic origin of street level heroin available in major metropolitan areas of the United States to federal state and local law enforcement authorities drug policy makers and drug abuse researchers In 2002 DEA s Intelligence Division provided funding for the purchase of retail level heroin samples in 23 metropolitan areas Each heroin purchase subsequently underwent in depth chemical analyses at the DEA Special Testing and Research Laboratory STRL to determine the purity and if possible the geographic source area signature analysis of the heroin 1 1 The DMP was initiated in the New York Field Division in 1979 To this day New York City DMP results are particularly important because the city remains the nation s largest heroin user market and because much of the white powder heroin available in East Coast markets is obtained there Between 1979 and 1991 the number of DEA offices participating in this program fluctuated between six and 12 In 1991 the DMP was expanded to include one city in every DEA Field Division Baltimore Maryland was included as a participant in early 1995 Orlando Florida in late 1996 and El Paso Texas in mid 1999 Since its inception the DMP has proven to be a valuable indicator for detecting trends in retail level heroin trafficking For example in the early to mid 1980s the DMP documented the increasing availability of Southeast Asian SEA heroin at the retail level in a number of U S cities In the mid 1990s data from the DMP revealed significant increases in the amount of South American SA heroin available at the retail level particularly in the metropolitan areas of the northeastern United States The goal of the DMP is to provide federal and other drug policy makers and drug abuse researchers with information regarding the nature of the domestic heroin problem at the street level Additional DMP data analysis reveals changes in heroin price and purity adulterants and diluents use patterns marketing practices availability and geographic source 2002 DMP Results Qualified Samples DEA offices in each city where the DMP is conducted are tasked with making 10 street level heroin purchases per quarter or 40 purchases per year The only exception is New York City which makes 20 purchases per quarter or 80 per year As a result 960 heroin samples should be purchased throughout the year as part of the DMP however the total number of samples included in the DMP analysis varies from year to year based on a variety of factors For example some exhibits are determined to contain no controlled substance some are determined to contain cocaine or other controlled substance and some while containing heroin do not contain sufficient heroin to allow for geographic analysis In other instances the results of the geographic analysis are inconclusive Such samples are not included in this analysis Those that are included are qualified samples meaning that price purity and geographic source data are available for the exhibit In 2002 614 qualified samples were purchased 2 2 Of these 341 were classified as SA heroin 241 were classified as Mexican MEX heroin 22 were classified as Southwest Asian SWA heroin and 10 were classified as SEA heroin see text below for description Nationwide in 2002 SA heroin samples had the highest average purity 46 0 percent SEA heroin had the lowest 23 9 percent MEX heroin averaged 27 3 percent pure and SWA heroin averaged 29 8 percent pure in 2002 Prices per milligram pure were similar for various types of heroin At 0 61 SEA samples had the lowest average price per milligram pure and SWA samples highest average price 0 75 per milligram pure SA heroin averaged 0 72 per milligram pure MEX heroin price averaged 0 70 2002 numbers for price per milligram pure are compared to previous years in Table 1 The price and purity of SA heroin have been remarkably stable for the past several years The price of MEX heroin dropped considerably between 2001 and 2002 However the 2002 price is more consistent with the 2000 price level Due to the small number of both SWA and SEA exhibits it is difficult to draw trending information based on the data 2002 DMP Results City by City Generally speaking the heroin market in the United States is divided geographically by the Mississippi River See appendix E East of the Mississippi River particularly in the Northeast where the largest U S heroin user population is located SA dominated the market in 2002 as it has in past years Mexican black tar and to a lesser extent Mexican brown powder heroin dominated markets west of the Mississippi River Of the DMP samples that were able to be classified 92 percent of those purchased east of the Mississippi River were SA heroin West of the Mississippi River 98 percent of the samples purchased were classified as MEX heroin In 2002 369 qualified samples were purchased east of the Mississippi River Of these 341 were determined to be SA heroin six were determined to be SEA heroin and 22 were SWA heroin Chicago purchased four SEA exhibits Atlanta purchased one and Washington DC purchased one Eight of the 22 SWA samples were purchased in the Washington DC Baltimore area The rest were purchased in Atlanta 4 Chicago 4 Detroit 4 New Orleans 1 and New York City 1 West of the Mississippi River 245 qualified samples were purchased in 2002 241 of them were determined to be MEX heroin The remaining four were SEA and were purchased in Dallas Texas Interestingly those four SEA exhibits averaged only 18 percent pure lower than the national average for SEA of 23 9 percent Even though the DMP is conducted nationwide the calculation of a national average for price and purity is often misleading because samples reflect local user preferences and market availability As a result the heroin market tends to be unique to each metropolitan area and any attempt to calculate national averages leads to numbers that do not accurately reflect local trends More telling than the changes in the national averages were the individual changes in purity and average price in the participating cities in 2002 Atlanta Heroin availability was stable in Atlanta in 2002 where heroin remains a commodity primarily obtained in the Bluff section of the city In other sections of Atlanta where heroin was available intelligence confirmed that the Bluff was the primary local source of supply In 2002 34 qualified samples were purchased in Atlanta 29 of which were SA heroin Four samples were determined to be SWA and one was SEA The SWA samples were determined to be 38 0 percent pure The SEA exhibit was purchased in December 2002 It was determined to be 61 4 percent pure The average purity of the SA exhibits was 52 4 percent and ranged in purity from 12 5 percent pure to 93 8 percent pure Baltimore Heroin plagues the Baltimore metropolitan area and its outlying suburbs In fact both law enforcement and medical officials in Baltimore consider heroin the city s most significant drug problem The high purity of heroin on the street level was responsible at least in part for a number of heroin related hospital emergencies According to treatment and parole and probation officials a large number of these medical emergencies occurred among newly released prison inmates who were unaware of the increased potency of the drug and among inexperienced users Suburban heroin abusers particularly teens and young adults often traveled into Baltimore to purchase heroin Heroin was also purchased on numerous corners in open air markets of West and East Baltimore in either raw high purity or scramble cut form Raw heroin was commonly sold in vials much like crack ocaine and ranged in purity from over 70 percent to well over 90 percent Scramble heroin was available throughout the city packaged primarily in gelatin capsules Scramble heroin ranged in purity from between approximately 10 percent and 20 percent In 2002 26 qualified purchases were made in Baltimore 24 of them were SA The SA exhibits ranged in purity from 7 1 percent to 82 6 percent and averaged 23 6 percent pure On average the SA exhibits cost 0 38 per milligram pure The remaining two exhibits were SWA averaging 14 2 percent pure and 0 33 per milligram pure Boston Heroin remained readily available throughout New England in 2002 selling at low prices and high purity levels At the street level heroin was routinely distributed in clear or colored glassine or wax packets with or without markings Abuse remained widespread with continued reports of heroin overdose deaths and other incidences occurring throughout New England In Boston 27 qualified samples were purchased in 2002 They were all determined to be SA heroin averaging just over 50 percent pure and costing 1 19 per milligram pure Chicago In Chicago the availability of heroin especially of SA heroin continued to increase during 2002 However heroin from other geographic source areas was also available In 2002 27 qualified exhibits were purchased in Chicago 19 of them were SA heroin 4 were SEA heroin and 4 were SWA heroin The SA heroin exhibits averaged 20 4 percent pure the SEA heroin exhibits averaged 20 8 percent pure and the SWA heroin exhibits 19 8 percent pure These purity levels suggest a high degree of niformity in the heroin market in Chicago The average price per milligram pure for SA heroin was 0 43 for SEA heroin 0 71 and for SWA heroin 0 39 The 15th Police District in Chicago has the highest concentration of open air heroin sales locations in the city Street gangs control virtually all of these locations Retail sellers compete with one another on almost every street corner for customers Many of the customers are young and white from affluent middle class Chicago suburbs The Chicago Police Department estimates that approximately two thirds of the heroin seized in the city originated in this district and the neighboring 11th District Because these areas have been identified as the most active heroin retail sales markets in the city the majority of the DMP purchases made in the past several years including in 2002 have occurred in these two districts Dallas In 2002 MEX heroin remained the most readily available type of heroin in Dallas accounting for 29 of the 33 qualified samples purchased as part of the DMP However white heroin has begun to appear in this market In 2000 no SEA heroin purchases were made in Dallas In 2001 five such purchases were made In 2002 four SEA heroin samples were purchased They averaged 18 percent pure and cost 0 46 per milligram pure Analysis of these samples however determined that three of them were purchased on the same date and were chemically identical The MEX heroin samples averaged 17 2 percent pure and cost 0 75 per milligram pure Denver The majority of heroin sales in Denver have traditionally taken place in the lower downtown area Street level weight is usually sold in grams selling from 100 to 150 MEX heroin was the only type encountered in the DMP in Denver in 2002 All 23 qualified samples were MEX heroin The samples averaged 18 4 percent pure ranging from 11 8 to 29 3 percent pure On average the samples cost 1 12 per milligram pure among the highest prices in the western region Detroit In 2002 SA heroin accounted for 12 of the 16 qualified samples purchased in Detroit Those 12 samples averaged 45 8 percent pure and cost 0 80 per milligram pure The remaining four exhibits were SWA heroin averaging 41 7 percent pure and costing on average 0 62 Chemical analysis determined that two of the SWA heroin exhibits were identical these two exhibits were purchased 2 days and nearly 5 miles apart El Paso Heroin is readily available in the El Paso metropolitan area and can be purchased city wide for 100 per gram In 2002 only seven qualified samples were purchased in El Paso They were all MEX heroin averaging 40 3 percent pure and 0 27 per milligram pure Houston Intelligence information indicates that the demand for Mexican brown powder heroin declined in the Houston area in 2002 Some heroin users bypassed other heroin sources of supply and specifically requested white heroin In November 2002 local police officers arrested a Hispanic male in downtown Houston who was in possession of approximately 1 ounce of white heroin Laboratory analysis revealed the heroin was at least 87 percent pure which is more than three times the purity level normally found at the street level in Houston Additional information indicates that the following areas are common street level distribution sites in Houston The East End near Canal and Navigation Streets The Greenspoint area The Washington Street area The North Main Street area The Yellowstone area Pasadena Texas Prices in Houston ranged from 20 for street level quantities of heroin 500 for ounce and between 1 600 and 2 000 for an ounce In 2002 39 qualified samples were purchased in Houston All were MEX heroin They averaged 28 2 percent pure and cost 0 64 per milligram pure The Houston exhibits ranged from 3 7 to 58 8 percent pure One exhibit contained heroin at 13 9 percent and cocaine at 4 5 percent Los Angeles In 2002 28 qualified samples were purchased in Los Angeles All were MEX heroin averaging 26 5 percent pure and costing 0 30 per milligram pure The exhibits ranged in purity from 9 0 to 50 1 percent Miami Twenty nine qualified samples were purchased in Miami in 2002 All 29 were SA heroin They averaged 29 4 percent pure and cost 0 61 per milligram pure Three of the Miami exhibits contained cocaine two as a trace substance and one at 0 64 percent New Orleans In 2002 23 qualified samples were purchased in New Orleans 22 were determined to be SA heroin at 30 4 percent pure and 1 65 per milligram pure The remaining exhibit was SWA heroin It was determined to be 40 percent pure and to cost 1 14 per milligram pure In 2001 one SWA heroin appeared in the New Orleans DMP It was determined to be 45 4 percent pure and to cost 0 37 per milligram pure New York City New York City is one of the most significant heroin destination and distribution centers in the United States In 2002 heroin was readily available from the various ethnic groups that comprise metropolitan New York City s demographic while prices were stable and purity high SA heroin was the most common type of heroin encountered in New York City in 2002 In fact of the 61 qualified exhibits purchased in 2002 60 were SA heroin Analysis revealed they averaged 61 5 percent pure and cost 0 36 per milligram pure the lowest price in the nation for SA heroin The remaining exhibit was SWA heroin at 56 8 percent pure and 0 23 per milligram pure In 2001 two samples of MEX heroin were purchased as part of the DMP No such atypical purchases were made in New York City in 2002 Newark In 2002 27 qualified samples were purchased in Newark all were SA heroin Those exhibits were analyzed to be 71 4 percent pure and to cost 0 39 per milligram pure That purity level led the nation in 2002 and the price per milligram pure was among the lowest for SA heroin Orlando Orlando s heroin market was very uniform in 2002 all 29 qualified exhibits were SA heroin Those exhibits were analyzed to be 46 1 percent pure and to cost 0 63 per milligram pure Philadelphia SA heroin remained widely available throughout Philadelphia during 2002 Although the greater Philadelphia area is generally considered a consumer market for sources in New York City and Miami the availability of cheap high purity SA heroin in Philadelphia and in particular the Badlands of North Philadelphia continued to attract lower level distributors and users from other states and localities to Philadelphia s street corner distribution locations The increased availability of cheaper higher purity heroin over the last few years has caused concern throughout Pennsylvania over a growing heroin use problem that reaches all areas and all socioeconomic backgrounds Heroin s popularity among teens and young adults remained high as they and other users consumed heroin either by itself or in combination with cocaine or alcohol a combination that typically leads to overdose deaths In some areas heroin overdose deaths have continued to rise in the last few years For example the Lackawanna County Coroner s Office reported only 13 drug overdose deaths combined in 1998 and 1999 in 2000 31 fatal drug overdoses were reported and in 2001 22 heroin overdose deaths were reported Through June 2002 there were 22 heroin overdose deaths reported in Lackawanna County Similarly in Lehigh and Northampton Counties all but one of the drug overdose fatalities were caused by either heroin by itself or heroin in combination with other substances However in Allegheny County western Pennsylvania the number of heroin overdose deaths continued its decline in 2002 after nearly tripling between 1997 and 2001 In 2002 heroin purity levels in Philadelphia were among the highest in the nation Based on the analysis of the 24 qualified exhibits all of which were SA heroin the average purity of heroin in Philadelphia was 66 3 percent and the average cost was 0 42 per milligram pure Phoenix MEX heroin dominated the market in Phoenix in 2002 all 29 qualified exhibits were determined to be MEX heroin Those exhibits were analyzed to be 48 9 percent pure a purity level that led the western region in 2002 Analysis also determined that the DMP samples in Phoenix cost 0 51 per milligram pure Table 2 provides a brief overview of heroin purity levels in Phoenix since 2000 See text above for description San Diego MEX heroin was readily available in Imperial County as well as San Diego in 2002 In fact MEX heroin accounted for all 30 qualified samples purchased in San Diego as part of the DMP in 2002 Those exhibits were analyzed to be 47 9 percent pure a purity level that ranked second only to Phoenix in the western region Analysis of the San Diego samples determined their cost to be 0 24 per milligram pure the cheapest in the western region San Francisco MEX heroin remained readily available throughout this region specifically in San Francisco s Mission Tenderloin Bayview Bernal Heights and Portrero Hill Districts Supplies were also readily available in San Leandro in Alameda County and throughout Sonoma County User quantities of black tar heroin the heroin of choice throughout the region were usually packaged in double plastic bags The DMP results bear this out all of the 22 qualified samples purchased in San Francisco in 2002 were determined to be MEX heroin Those exhibits were analyzed to be 12 1 percent pure and to cost 0 99 per milligram pure San Juan Heroin was readily available in all areas of Puerto Rico in 2002 and was the most widely abused drug in eastern Puerto Rico particularly in the Fajardo area The most common areas for buying heroin were the drug points in the public housing projects and barriadas marginal neighborhoods Intravenous injection was the primary means of ingestion However a small number of addicts snorted the drug sometimes mixed with cocaine in a combination known as a spitball SA heroin dominated the market in Puerto Rico and all 27 of the qualified exhibits purchased as part of the DMP in 2002 were determined to be SA heroin They averaged 36 7 percent pure and cost 0 48 per milligram pure Seattle MEX heroin dominated the market in Seattle in 2002 accounting for all 16 of the qualified samples purchased there Those exhibits were analyzed to be 10 5 percent pure the lowest purity level in the nation and to cost 0 89 per milligram pure The number of needles exchanged at needle exchange program sites provides an indication of the high demand for heroin in the Puget Sound Washington and Lane County Oregon regions Many of these needles are used for heroin injections although they can also be used for methamphetamine insulin or any other injectable substance Table 3 shows the number of needles exchanged in King Seattle and Pierce Tacoma Counties each year since 1998 and the number of needles exchanged in Lane County Eugene Oregon each fiscal year since 2000 see text above for description St Louis See above text for description Heroin abuse and trafficking continued to be a growing concern in the St Louis area in 2002 Mexican black tar heroin was readily available in the depressed urban areas of St Louis and it represented all 18 of the qualified exhibits purchased by the DMP in 2002 Those exhibits were analyzed to be 13 8 percent pure and to cost 1 54 per milligram pure Heroin is typically sold in buttons for 10 Eight to 10 buttons weigh a gram and the heroin is brought into the area from California Arizona Texas and Chicago Illinois A comparison of DMP data for St Louis from 1994 to 1998 shows a nearly three fold increase in the overall purity of street level heroin however since 2000 street level heroin purities have remained stable as reflected in Table 4 Washington DC The heroin market in Washington DC where the heroin trade is well entrenched was one of the most varied markets in the DMP in 2002 Nineteen qualified exhibits were purchased as part of the DMP Of that number 12 were SA heroin one was SEA heroin and six were SWA heroin The 12 SA heroin samples averaged 20 8 percent pure and cost 0 79 per milligram pure The SEA heroin exhibit was 22 7 percent pure and cost 0 46 per milligram pure The six SWA heroin exhibits averaged 22 2 percent pure and cost an average of 0 47 per milligram pure The 14th Street corridor in Northwest Washington DC is a magnet for suburban users purchasing high purity heroin Distributors in other areas of the District particularly the eastern quadrants continue to supply heroin ranging in purities from less than 10 percent to 25 percent The eastern part of the city was frequented more by well established sellers and long term addicts than by suburban users These neighborhoods experienced a higher volume of trafficking and therefore higher levels of associated violence Washington DC Metropolitan Police Department officials also attribute lower levels of violence in the Northwest corridor and other high purity heroin distribution areas to a different mentality on the part of heroin distributors there who serve up heroin to primarily white suburban customers According to officials distributors in these areas take care of their customers who tend to spend several hundred dollars at a time in order to maintain a regular profit Geo Probes A Look at New Cities Beginning in 2001 DEA began a new initiative within the DMP called Geographical Probes or Geo Probes The purpose of the Geo Probes is to gain additional intelligence about existing and emerging heroin markets in areas outside the traditional DMP areas In order to accomplish that mission DEA made funds available for sample heroin purchases in selected cities across the United States In 2002 those cities were Huntington Park California Broward County Florida Holyoke and Worcester Massachusetts Warren Youngstown Ohio Eugene Springfield Oregon Austin Texas Corpus Christi and Robstown Texas Laredo Texas and Milwaukee Wisconsin Holyoke and Worcester Massachusetts Holyoke and Worcester are source centers for high quality heroin for surrounding cities and towns in western Massachusetts and Vermont Numerous overdose deaths and incidents have been attributed to heroin obtained from these areas In order to determine the purity and the geographic origin of the heroin available in these areas a Geo Probe was conducted there during August and September 2002 Five heroin purchases were made and all five qualified samples determined to be SA heroin They averaged 49 8 percent pure and cost on average 0 84 per milligram pure DMP purchases in nearby Boston averaged 50 3 percent pure and cost 1 19 per milligram pure perhaps an indication of a New York City based source of supply In New York City SA heroin averaged 61 5 percent pure and sold for 0 36 per milligram pure in 2002 see text above for description Milwaukee Wisconsin Intelligence information in 2002 indicated that Milwaukee had a significant heroin presence around the inner city area with purity levels occasionally rising to the 60 90 percent range In order to develop further intelligence regarding this market a Geo Probe was conducted in Milwaukee in May and June 2002 This Geo Probe resulted in the purchase of five exhibits Unfortunately only two of them were qualified samples Those two samples were both determined to be SA heroin at more than 70 percent pure They cost on average 0 33 per milligram pure Despite the limited number of qualified samples the results of this Geo Probe are compelling in that the average purity of samples in Milwaukee was significantly higher than purity levels in nearby Chicago which has long been identified as a source city for Milwaukee In addition heroin in Milwaukee costs less on average than heroin in Chicago Further information regarding the comparison of prices and purities for SA heroin in Milwaukee Chicago and Detroit is detailed in 7 Table 7 see text above for description Warren Youngstown Ohio In response to numerous overdose deaths in the Warren Youngstown area four heroin purchases were made in that area during May and June 2002 as part of the Geo Probe program All four purchases were qualified samples and were determined to be SA heroin which averaged 48 1 percent pure and 1 42 per milligram pure Purity levels in Warren are consistent with those in Detroit but prices are higher indicating that heroin sources of supply may be based in Detroit Austin Texas In order to gather intelligence on the street level heroin trade in this college town a Geo Probe was conducted in Austin during June 2002 Five heroin exhibits were purchased and all five were qualified samples of MEX origin They averaged 20 5 percent pure Two of the exhibits were just over 6 percent pure The remaining four exhibits however averaged just over 30 percent pure suggesting broad fluctuations in the market that could be dangerous for new users Corpus Christi and Robstown Texas In December 2002 a Geo Probe was initiated in Corpus Christi Robstown after a rash of heroin overdose deaths in that area Intelligence information indicated that MEX brown powder was the heroin of choice in the Corpus Christi area and purity levels were generally low Information obtained from the Geo Probe confirms this intelligence Heroin prices averaged from 20 for a hit to 70 for a gram of MEX brown powder heroin Four heroin exhibits were purchased as part of the program and three of them were determined to be MEX heroin Those three samples averaged 6 83 percent pure Laredo Texas In mid August 2002 four individuals three of them teenagers died from heroin overdoses The youngest victim a 13 year old girl also tested positive for cocaine opiates and marijuana All of the victims lived in the same area of Laredo Two of the victims were known heroin users and one still had the needle sticking in his arm This spate of overdose deaths led to the initiation of a Geo Probe in this area Six heroin purchases were made between August and December 2002 Five of those purchases were determined to be MEX heroin averaging 57 6 percent pure Four of those exhibits were more than 60 percent pure Interestingly the only exhibit for which a geographic origin could not be determined contained heroin at 8 3 percent pure and cocaine at 73 7 percent Note Taken together the three Geo Probes conducted in south Texas resulted in the purchase of 13 qualified exhibits averaging 31 6 percent pure and costing 0 69 per milligram pure Huntington Park California In response to a report of high purity heroin being sold at the retail level in Huntington Park a Geo Probe was conducted there in November and December 2002 Five heroin purchases were made and all five were determined to be MEX heroin They averaged 25 8 percent pure and 0 29 per milligram pure Even though the average price and purity are consistent with price and purity levels for Los Angeles one Geo Probe purchase was determined to be 49 1 percent pure confirming the intelligence that led to the probe Broward County Florida A significant increase in overdose deaths in Broward and Palm Beach Counties led to the initiation of a Geo Probe in Broward County in September and October 2002 Five heroin exhibits were purchased as part of that program however only two of those exhibits were qualified samples The qualified samples were determined to be SA heroin at 17 4 percent pure costing 0 76 per milligram pure The remaining samples were determined to contain cocaine Eugene and Springfield Oregon In response to a report of street level heroin prices dropping to 30 per gram in this area a Geo Probe was conducted in Eugene and Springfield in June 2002 Five heroin exhibits were purchased and all were determined to be MEX heroin averaging 10 8 percent pure and 0 67 per milligram pure Those numbers are similar to price and purity levels in Seattle Unfortunately three of the exhibits were purchased on the same date in the same general area and chemical analysis revealed them to be identical Appendix A Definitions Adulterants Pharmacologically active substances such as caffeine mono acetylmorphine procaine and quinine which remain in or are added to the final heroin product at the completion of the heroin conversion process Composite Samples A limited number of samples can be identified as being part of the same batch and or as having been purchased from the same dealer s based on laboratory analyses and the date and location of the purchases Samples of this type are combined to form a composite Diluents Pharmacologically inactive substances such as lactose mannitol starch and sucrose added to increase bulk Heroin Signature Analysis A program developed by the DEA to identify the geographic source area of a heroin sample Heroin Signature Analysis is based on an exhaustive chemical profile of authentic samples acquired from each of the four major heroin source areas South America Mexico Southeast Asia and Southwest Asia Heroin Signature Classification The result of heroin signature analysis Classifications currently defined include South American SA Mexican MEX Southeast Asian SEA and Southwest Asia SWA heroin Samples meeting these classifications are referred to as qualified samples When the results of a signature analysis are inconclusive the sample may be listed as unknown or insufficient weight Insufficient Weight A sample of heroin that is too small for signature analysis Generally an exhibit should weigh at least 1 gram net including diluents and adulterants This amount ensures that there are at least 45 milligrams of pure heroin available for signature analysis Net Weight The total weight of the heroin exhibit including diluents and adulterants excluding its packaging Price Per Milligram Pure The price of the sample divided by the pure weight expressed in milligrams Pure Weight The weight of the pure heroin determined by multiplying the purity of a sample by its net weight Purity The amount of heroin present compared to all other substances in the sample Purity is expressed as a percent Qualified Sample A heroin sample that is able to be analyzed and classified by the STRL for source Unknown A sample of heroin analyzed by the STRL but for which the result of the analysis does not match any of the standard classifications See Heroin Signature Classification Appendix B 2000 Heroin Counts Purities Prices and Origin by City Appendix C 2001 Heroin Counts Purities Prices and Origin by City Appendix D 2002 Heroin Counts Purities Prices and

final quarter of calendar year CY 2002 coincided with the first quarter of Fiscal Year FY 2003 because at that time DEA was operating under a Continuing Resolution and DMP purchases were not funded in most cities As a result fewer total samples were purchased in 2002 and therefore fewer qualified samples were available for inclusion in this report This report was prepared by the Domestic Strategic Intelligence Unit of the Special Strategic Intelligence Section of the Office of Strategic Intelligence This report reflects information received prior to September 2003 Comments and requests for
