Security Online The Appeals Process Social Security Administration SSA Publication number No 05 10041 April 1999 June 1998 edition may be used inventory control number ICN 459260 10041 pdf pdf Social Security wants to be sure that every decision made about your Social Security or Supplemental Security Income SSI claim is correct We carefully consider all the information in your case before we make any decisions that affect your eligibility or your benefit amount If we decide that you are not eligible or no longer eligible for benefits or that the amount of your payments should be changed we ll send you a letter explaining our decision If you don t agree with our decision you can ask us to look at your case again When you ask for an appeal we will look at the entire decision even those parts that were in your favor If our decision was wrong we will change it When And How Can I Appeal If you wish to appeal you must make your request in writing within 60 days from the date you receive our letter We assume you receive the letter five days after the date on it unless you can show us you received it later Call your Social Security office if you need help with your appeal How Many Appeal Levels Are There There are four levels of appeal They are 1 reconsideration 2 hearing by an administrative law judge 3 review by the Appeals Council and 4 federal court review When we send you a letter about a decision on your claim we ll tell you how to appeal the decision Reconsideration A reconsideration is a complete review of your claim by someone who didn t take part in the first decision We will look at all the evidence submitted when the original decision was made plus any new evidence Most reconsiderations involve a review of your files without the need for you to be present But when you appeal a decision that you are no longer eligible for disability benefits because your condition has improved you have a choice of a file review or meeting with a Social Security representative to discuss your case You can meet with a disability hearing officer and explain why you believe you still have a disability Hearing If you disagree with the reconsideration decision you may ask for a hearing The hearing will be conducted by an administrative law judge who had no part in the first decision or the reconsideration of your case The hearing is usually held within 75 miles of your home The administrative law judge will notify you of the time and place of the hearing You and your representative if you have one may come to the hearing and explain your case in person You may look at the information in your file and give new information The administrative law judge will question you and any witnesses you bring to the hearing You or your representative also may question the witnesses It is usually to your advantage to attend the hearing If you don t wish to do so you must tell us in writing that you don t want to attend Unless the administrative law judge believes your presence is needed to decide the case he or she will make a decision based on all the information in your case including any new information given After the hearing we will send you a letter and a copy of the administrative law judge s decision Appeals Council If you disagree with the hearing decision you may ask for a review by Social Security s Appeals Council We ll be glad to help you ask for this review The Appeals Council looks at all requests for review but it may deny a request if it believes the hearing decision was correct If the Appeals Council decides to review your case it will either decide your case itself or return it to an administrative law judge for further review You will receive a copy of the Appeals Council s decision or order sending it back to an administrative law judge Federal Court If you disagree with the Appeals Council s decision or if the Appeals Council decides not to review your case you may file a lawsuit in a federal district court Will My Benefits Continue In some cases you may ask us to continue paying your benefits while we make a decision on your appeal You can ask for this continuation of benefits when you are appealing our decision that you are no longer eligible for Social Security disability benefits because your condition has improved or you are appealing our decision that you are no longer eligible for SSI payments or that your SSI payment should be reduced If you want your benefits to continue you must tell us within 10 days of the date you receive our letter If your appeal is turned down you may have to pay back any money you weren t eligible to receive Can Someone Help Me Yes Many people handle their own Social Security appeals with free help from Social Security But you can choose a lawyer a friend or
