research on human contributions and responses to global change is relevant to each of the other research program elements The current focus of this research is on improving understanding of the potential effects of global change on human health human forcing of the climate system of land use and other global environmental change science based regional and sectoral assessments that accurately reflect the limits of current understanding decision support under conditions of complexity and uncertainty and integrated assessment methods The USGCRP budget includes 121 million in FY 2003 primarily for the study of the human contributions and responses to global change Humans are a part of the Earth system are drivers of landcover change and are significant contributors to the condition of other natural resources Humans also respond to changes in their environment Adaptations when effective enhance the resilience of both managed and natural systems Research on human contributions and responses to global change have helped explain how humans drive important interventions in the Earth system how they are affected by interactions between natural and social processes and how humans devise mitigation and adaptation strategies in response to environmental change The USGCRP looks to the study of human contributions and responses to understand the means by which human populations influence the natural world anticipate the future handle uncertainty and prepare for change Developing a more integrated understanding of the complex interactions of human and Earth system processes is desirable for identifying vulnerable systems and pursuing opportunities and options to enhance resilience The study of the human interface with change in the global environment is especially important because of its capacity to inform public policy Research on human contributions and responses to global change has been organized around questions first identified by the National Research Council in Global Environmental Change Research Pathways for the Next Decade 1999 and then been more finely honed by the USGCRP agencies The focus of the USGCRP s human dimensions research is cur rently on Potential effects of global change on human health Human forcing of the climate system of land use and other global environmental change Potential regional and sectoral vulnerability and resilience Decision support under conditions of complexity and uncertainty Integrated assessment methods images ocp2003 ocpfy2003 fig8 1 htm 8 1b HCR NorthAmerLights images ocp2003 ocpfy2003 fig8 1
