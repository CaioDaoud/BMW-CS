coordinated all energy emergency systems under the Office of Emergency Services Previously emergency services were scattered among diverse agencies and departments By the early spring of 2001 this successful consolidation effort put the State in a strategic position to manage the repercussions of the 9 11 attacks on America since the energy emergency systems were now all under one agency The State Energy Plans have resulted in creating the energy conservation and energy efficiency programs that averted predicted blackouts in California over the summer and fall of 2001 In addition to the conservation program Flex Your Power and rebates for energy efficiency Renewable Energy programs in California have expanded exponentially over the last year Governor Davis has issued a series of Executive Orders that require state buildings including those among the university systems to be energy self sufficient He further supports a Renewable Portfolio Standard of 20 renewable energy in the State of California energy generation mix by the year 2010 Currently the State has 10 renewable energy generation which includes wind solar biomass geothermal and small not large or over 50MW hydro Several governmental agencies and commissions have also endorsed this goal including the new California Consumer Power and Conservation Financing Authority the California Energy Commission and the Governor s Commission for the 21st Century on Infrastructure in their report issued in February 2002 Additionally the State has aggressively sought to bring new advanced technologies like fuel cells into commercial use in the State PowerGeneration shtml Power Generation Power generation in California was in transition and in dramatic need of restructuring as a result of the deregulation legislation passed in 1996 AB1890 The Office of Planning and Research has sponsored renewable energy forums in conjunction with the Governor s successful efforts to generate more power in California More than 300 renewable energy generators participated and have submitted over 3000 MW of new power supply to be licensed sited and contracted since the summer of 2001 NewTechnology shtml New Technology The State of California has supported the commercialization of new advanced technologies through methods such as public private organizations including the Fuel Cell Partnership for vehicles the State Stationary Fuel Cell Collaborative and by research through the California Energy Commission Public Interest Energy Research program the Air Resources Board research and the Waste Management Board programs among others Infrastructure shtml Infrastructure As the Governor s Commission on Infrastructure reported in the winter of 2002 each infrastructure in the state is linked to the other none can operate or exist alone Energy infrastructure is linked to transportation environment and more yet is also keyed into education since the higher costs for new technologies are often created by the lack of a skilled and trained workforce Financing shtml Financing The Governor s web site http www governor ca gov state govsite gov homepage jsp http www governor ca gov contains links to a One Stop Shop matrix listing all the state programs available for public and private organizations to apply for funds for implementing renewable and energy efficient programs Along with
