Report of the National Space Science Data Center PREFACE The http nssdc gsfc nasa gov National Space Science Data Center is pleased to issue this 2000 Annual Report describing 1 the 2000 growth and evolution of NSSDC s data archives access pathways and other tools and services and 2 the 2000 access to those data and services by NSSDC s customer communities This report has been made WWW accessible in the hope that readers will avail themselves of the opportunity to link to the services reported herein The scope of this report is that of the traditional NSSDC as defined by the NSSDC budget It should be noted that some of the activities thereby supported are the responsibilities of the http adf gsfc nasa gov adf adf html Astrophysics and http spdf gsfc nasa gov Space Physics Data Facilities organizational peers of the formal NSSDC within Goddard s http ssdoo gsfc nasa gov Space Science Data Operations Office I welcome suggestions for user benefiting improvements to this Annual Report and to NSSDC services Joseph H King Head National Space Science Data Center 1 INTRODUCTION This report characterizes NSSDC s data holdings metadata holdings access pathways and value added data products tools and services at the end of 2000 with a focus on the 2000 activities leading to that end of year state In addition this report characterizes the nature and amount of 2000 access to NSSDC s data and services by its many users from various communities 2 HIGHLIGHTS The most important result of NSSDC s 2000 activities is the continuing preservation of growing space science data volumes ensuring their continuing and future accessibility to the space science education and general public communities The statistics to follow reveal that NSSDC s archive has now grown to 17 0 TB of space science data and an additional 3 3 TB of Earth science data During 2000 1 7 TB of data were added to the NSSDC archive which now holds data from over 1400 experiments flown on 420 spacecraft Next NSSDC continues to distribute large amounts of data by network to the space science community and general public and by offline mailings to the general public Again following statistics detail the data volumes disseminated via various pathways to various communities We note here that during 2000 NSSDC s customers downloaded via network just over 2 6 million data files a 30 increase over 1999 and received about 2 6 TB of data on mailed media NSSDC s data dissemination is leading to the publication of significant new science The Appendix html Appendix of this Annual Report lists 65 science papers acknowledging NSSDC data or services as contributing to their analyses These are papers which have come to the attention of our staff Most science journals in which NSSDC data or services may have been used are not reviewed by our staff routinely so the list represents a lower limit on papers enabled or benefitted by NSSDC The year 2000 marked the start of multiple data management advances at NSSDC Archive Information Packages bundles of data files and companion attribute files as prescribed by the ISO CCSDS http ssdoo gsfc nasa gov nost isoas ref model html Archive Reference model were defined created and written to DLT jukebox thereby initiating a gradual transition of NSSDC s permanent digital archive from offline shelves to nearline jukeboxes At the same time the AIPs constituent data and attribute files are being written to a new unix based RAID magnetic disk environment cf ftp nssdcftp gsfc nasa gov ftp nssdcftp gsfc nasa gov Data previously ftp accessible from other NSSDC systems are also being written to the same location The first data being packaged as AIPs are the space physics data and IRAS data on NSSDC s VMS based optical disk jukeboxes NDADS that are about to be retired and data newly arriving at NSSDC Details on these data management changes are given in the web accessible NSSDC Newsletter December 2000 http nssdc gsfc nasa gov nssdc news http nssdc gsfc nasa gov nssdc news NSSDC developed a new family of graphical display and subset interfaces for selected ftp accessible ASCII and gzipped ASCII data sets that are awaiting possible conversion to http nssdc gsfc nasa gov cdf cdf home html Common Data Format for support by http cdaweb gsfc nasa gov CDAWeb This family called Ftphelper aids in the data preview and selection process See http nssdc gsfc nasa gov ftphelper http nssdc gsfc nasa gov ftphelper Through its NASA Science Office of Standards and Technology http ssdoo gsfc nasa gov nost NOST NSSDC provides international leadership in providing increasingly effective digital data archiving During 2000 the NOST led http ssdoo gsfc nasa gov nost fepc Formats Evolution Process Committee prepared and released for community review a paper proposing a possible time series object that could lead to improvements in the science community s ability to understand and process time series data Also there was growing worldwide acceptance of the NOST led ISO CCSDS sponsored http ssdoo gsfc nasa gov nost isoas dads ws html Archive Reference model and use of this model in refashioning NSSDC s own data management approach as mentioned above There was high level interest in 2000 in the recovery and digitization of data from the http nssdc gsfc nasa gov nssdc news sept00 viking lander html Labelled Release biology experiment flown to Mars on the two Viking Lander spacecraft NSSDC played a key role along with the Planetary Data System s Geosciences node and with two members of the original science team in effecting this Much keypunching was done from NSSDC held microfilmed numeric listings and from newly provided numeric listings on paper This newly digitally available data set is supporting new Life on Mars analyses Two other notable data rescue efforts occurred in 2000 First a unique ftp nssdcftp gsfc nasa gov spacecraft data imp imp8 plasma lanl magnetotail 12s IMP 8 magnetotail electron data set available only as numeric listings and plots on microfilm was scanned and passed through Optical Character Recognition The resulting ASCII files were manually cleaned and made ftp accessible Also NSSDC began a http nssdc gsfc nasa gov nssdc news june00 digitization html systematic conversion of its film archive to computer accessible TIFF format with the scanning of Magellan 10 x 10 film Venus imagery and Mariner series 70 mm film Venus and Mars imagery NSSDC s http adc gsfc nasa gov Astronomical Data Center ADC chartered to acquire manage and provide access to astronomical source catalogs saw monthly accesses to its catalog and visualization servers of 32 000 and 5200 respectively The ADC created the first online repository of XML data http xml gsfc nasa gov guides http xml gsfc nasa gov guides and remains at the forefront of XML development as applied to astrophysical and astronomical data NSSDC provided leadership to the NASA Sun Earth Connection SEC Education Forum SECEF sponsored by the NASA SEC enterprise of the Office of Space Science In particular SECEF played key roles in year 2000 creations of 1 a new web accessible http teachspacescience stsci edu space science education resource directory and 2 a new Making Sun Earth Conceptions CD ROM with various sections oriented to various subsets of the K 12 population Readers are encouraged to exercise the multiple options on the hierarchical array of WWW pages starting with http nssdc gsfc nasa gov NSSDC s home page There are several more functionalities beyond those called out in the preceding paragraphs 3 DATA MANAGED AT NSSDC AND 2000 INFLOW AND OUTFLOW There are several ways to characterize the multi disciplinary NSSDC archive Byte counts are a common metric for modern archives and will be reported herein Numbers and diversity of media volumes managed and numbers of distinct data sets are also very important In NSSDC s terminology a data set is typically all the data from a given instrument at a given processing level in a given format The diversity of data sets and of media types relate to the intellectual heterogeneity and technical heterogeneity of the archive respectively and we shall report on these also At the end of 2000 NSSDC had 4 582 distinct data sets and accompanying documentation packages being managed Tables html tab1 Table 1 indicates the disciplines from which these data sets come and a breakout as to whether the data sets are digital or non digital film etc The table shows that these data sets come from 1 416 experiments which have flown on 422 mostly NASA spacecraft By data set count space physics is the dominant discipline accounting for over half NSSDC s data sets This reflects the fact that in its early years NASA launched a preponderance of space physics missions and also that space physics spacecraft typically carry more independent experiments than do astrophysics missions Note from the table that NSSDC manages almost as many non digital mostly film data sets as digital data sets although it should be noted that NSSDC has been acquiring almost no non digital data in recent years and has been gradually converting parts of its film archive to a digital form Tables html tab2 Table 2 is a different characterization of the NSSDC archive by byte counts and media volume counts The table shows 20 3 TB of total data a 3 3 TB subset which is network accessible and 75 767 digital media at NSSDC The byte counts are estimates involving for some data sets assumptions about the mean numbers of bytes on various media types Note that only astrophysics data and space physics data are network accessible from NSSDC That planetary data are not network accessible is the result of the http pds jpl nasa gov Planetary Data System s making most or all its planetary data network accessible and because of the emphasis of the PDS through which virtually all planetary mission data has entered the NSSDC archive for the past several years on CD ROM production and dissemination Exceptions are NSSDC s http nssdc gsfc nasa gov photo gallery photo gallery and http nssdc gsfc nasa gov imgcat image catalog which are WWW accessible from http nssdc gsfc nasa gov planetary these are largely oriented towards the general public NSSDC s Earth science data are gradually being migrated to the EOSDIS data management infrastructure hence are not good candidates for network accessibility from NSSDC Tables html tab3a Tables 3a and Tables html tab3b 3b better characterize NSSDC s network accessible astrophysics and space physics data by project and by whether the data are immediately accessible from magnetic disk online or from the robotics based NDADS system nearline This annual report will be the last one to report on NDADS which will be retired during 2001 in favor of a data access system based on RAID magnetic disk in a unix environment Most NDADS resident space physics data plus NDADS long wavelength IRAS astrophysics data are being migrated to the RAID system Most NDADS resident astrophysics data will be made network accessible from other NASA supported entities Tables html tab4 Table 4 characterizes the digital media managed at NSSDC not including back up copies This table is an expansion of Tables html tab2 Table 2 in which total numbers of unique digital media volumes were given It should be noted that most volumes are replicable and have one backup volume However for http nssdc gsfc nasa gov cd rom CD ROM Titles which are not locally replicable NSSDC typically holds between 20 and 200 copies of each title For these NSSDC must replenish stock through a commercial vendor as request activity drives NSSDC stock down DLT and DVD are expected to become increasingly important at NSSDC Tables html tab5 Table 5 characterizes NSSDC s non digital archive by disciplines by form factor Note that NSSDC has large volumes of non digital data for each of the discipline areas it supports It should be noted however that very little new data have been arriving at NSSDC in non digital form in recent years NSSDC has recently begun an effort to systematically convert this film archive to computer readable form 3 1 DATA INFLOW Tables html tab6 Tables 6 and Tables html tab7 7 characterize the inflow of digital data to NSSDC during 2000 In particular Tables html tab6 Table 6 shows that NSSDC received approximately 1 7 TB of new data in 2000 via a combination of networks and hard media Tables html tab6 Table 6 shows data volumes by project with the astrophysics and space physics subsets of ISTP Wind and Ulysses data attributed to their respective disciplines Dominating the counts are the media based Level 0 data from the FAST and ISTP missions plus data from the Mars Global Surveyor and EUVE missions Tables html tab7 Table 7 characterizes the inflowing media types by discipline CD WO media are the dominant input media type overall During 2000 NSSDC received approximately 240 GB of data electronically in addition to the data arriving on the media reported in Tables html tab7 Table 7 The electronic inflow was dominated by the http nssdc gsfc nasa gov space isis html ISIS ionogram digitization effort 84 GB and by ISTP and IMAGE data with lesser amounts from a number of spaceflight projects By data set count which as noted earlier marks the intellectual heterogeneity of NSSDC 109 distinct and new data sets from 20 flight experiments arrived at NSSDC during 2000 3 2 DATA OUTFLOW NSSDC provides user access to its data holdings through multiple electronic interfaces and in addition through a user support infrastructure for the mailing of offline digital and non digital data volumes Most electronic interfaces are accessible through http nssdc gsfc nasa gov NSSDC s WWW home page and include 1 special WWW based interfaces to specific data sets or groups thereof 2 ftp nssdcftp gsfc nasa gov anonymous ftp pathways to a range of data files maintained permanently on NSSDC magnetic disk as well as files staged from NSSDC s nearline mass storage environment NDADS 3 http nssdc gsfc nasa gov about about ndads html WWW based and other interfaces to NDADS e g SPyCAT for the purpose of selecting data files and having them staged or downloaded Note that NDADS will be retired during 2001 The dominant special WWW based data access interfaces that NSSDC offers to the research community relate to ISTP key parameter and a growing range of other space physics data http cdaweb gsfc nasa gov CDAWeb the OMNI and uniformized COHO solar wind datasets through http nssdc gsfc nasa gov omniweb OMNIWeb and http nssdc gsfc nasa gov cohoweb COHOWeb respectively various atmospheric and ionospheric data http nssdc gsfc nasa gov atmoweb ATMOWeb http space gsfc nasa gov astro iras IRAS http space gsfc nasa gov astro cobe COBE and http space gsfc nasa gov astro swas SWAS and the http adc gsfc nasa gov Astronomical Data Center astronomical source catalogs and journal tables CDAWeb and the below addressed http sscweb gsfc nasa gov SSCWeb system are joint services of NSSDC and the Space Physics Data Facility The OMNI data set is a 37 year compilation of multi spacecraft near earth solar wind magnetic field and plasma data and energetic particle data while the COHOWeb database is a uniformized set of files of merged magnetic field plasma and position data for each of many deep space spacecraft Tables html tab8a Table 8a shows annual statistics for the CDAWeb OMNIWeb COHOWeb and ATMOWeb systems Note the continuing steady growth in usage of these systems In 2000 they were used by NSSDC s customers to produce over 400 plots listings and data files every working day Tables html tab8b Table 8b reports statistics on the usage of NSSDC s executable http nssdc gsfc nasa gov space model geophysical models services and its services for magnetospheric via http sscweb gsfc nasa gov SSCWeb and heliospheric orbits These services have been available for some years now The models service lets users specify a model a spatial point of interest and any other parameters on which the model depends and have the model parameters computed at the point or along a profile through the point Tables html tab8b Table 8b shows that there were about 52 000 such computations done by NSSDC customers in 2000 with geomagnetic ionospheric and atmospheric models dominating Ftp access to models software is included in ftp access statistics in Tables html tab9 Table 9 not in Tables html tab8b Table 8b Tables html tab8b Table 8b also reveals over 28 000 orbit computations a 38 increase over 1999 Of these about 78 use the primarily magnetospheric http sscweb gsfc nasa gov SSCWeb service and the balance use the http nssdc gsfc nasa gov space helios heli html Heliocentric Ephemerides page A great many NSSDC data sets and other information services are held permanently on magnetic disk for anonymous ftp access mainly from NSSDC s unix computers The reader is invited to review all these services from the ftp nssdcftp gsfc nasa gov ftp link on NSSDC home page Tables html tab9 Table 9 gives the annual counts of files downloaded both overall nearly 2 3 million files in 2000 up by 35 from 1999 and for selected directories with high activity Note that the http nssdc gsfc nasa gov photo gallery Photo Gallery of high public interest dominates the statistics The researcher downloading of 76 000 data files from the spacecraft data subdirectory shows the high interest in and great value of this service These counts do not include data files ftp downloaded after having been staged from NSSDC s NDADS nearline system relevant statistics on NDADS access are discussed in the following paragraphs Tables html tab10 Table 10 summarizes the 2000 accesses to NSSDC s nearline mass storage environment http nssdc gsfc nasa gov about about ndads html NDADS through the multiplicity of available interfaces Note that three measures are offered for each mission supported A request is the specification of one or multiple entry ID s each of which specifies one or more data files Both request counts and counts of files are reported Finally as a measure of the breadth of interest in the data from any given mission we count on a monthly basis and report annual means of these monthly counts the numbers of unique electronic addresses username site accessing each mission s data NDADS hosted a totality of 5 568 requests in 2000 for a total of 109 thousand data files These numbers are lower than in 1999 as most astrophysics data are now accessible from elsewhere and as NSSDC s magnetic disk holdings of space physics data grow In particular IUE data has ceased to be the dominant beneficiary of NSSDC s nearline environment as the http archive stsci edu mast html STScI MAST service became fully operational during 1999 Broadly based communities accessed IMP 8 ISTP and IRAS data from NDADS WWW access statistics are frequently misleading insofar as they usually individually count the many files buttons etc that make up a page Nevertheless growth in WWW accesses is indicative of continuing and growing use of the WWW provided services In 2000 there were 11 2 million hits monthly to NSSDC s two main www servers nssdc and bolero This is up by 18 over 1999 While the dominant mode of dissemination of data to the astrophysics and space physics research communities is via the internet NSSDC continues to provide a high level of offline data dissemination Tables html tab11 Table 11 shows that NSSDC responded to almost 1 200 distinct requests for significant products plus by footnote 2 700 poster requests Tables html tab11 Table 11 also characterizes the user community of NSSDC s offline services To a very large extent it is the U S and international general public the education enterprise publishers etc and their desire for NASA imagery on CD ROM and as film products that account for most of NSSDC s offline request activity Tables html tab12 Table 12 gives the counts of requests for offline data sets from various disciplines in 2000 and as integrated over NSSDC s history A small fraction of requests which are multi disciplinary are double counted in this table Note particularly the dominance of planetary data over both time scales This is largely associated with lunar and planetary image data which are widely requested by the general public The high level of astrophysical offline activity to a large extent reflects requests by the amateur and professional astronomical communities for ADC catalogs on CD ROM Most offline space physics request activity was for copies of the IMAGE based Solar Storms video tape Tables html tab13 Table 13 shows the most recent 5 year history of NSSDC s offline data request activity by media type Several points are noteworthy The dominant mode of offline digital data dissemination continues to be by http nssdc gsfc nasa gov cd rom CD ROM It is of interest to note that every working day of 2000 NSSDC mailed about 18 CD ROMs to 3 requesters These numbers are down by 30 from 1999 as more members of the general public are able to access NSSDC s data electronically Note that magnetic tape dissemination fell to zero in 2000 and is unlikely to be reported on in future years Also significant in Tables html tab13 Table 13 is the fact that requests to NSSDC for film data have not declined over the past 5 years The number of film products mailed was up significantly in 2000 NSSDC finished one film request every working day Finally very noteworthy is the distribution of over 2 700 copies of the http adc gsfc nasa gov mw milkyway html Multi wavelength Milky Way poster or http space gsfc nasa gov astro cobe COBE poster created by the SSDOO Astrophysics Data Facility as special education outreach products These distributions are not included in the counts of Tables html tab11 Tables 11 and Tables html tab12 12 4 ADDITIONAL NSSDC SERVICES In addition to its archive of scientific data characterized in the preceding part of this Annual Report NSSDC offers a number of additional services which are described in this Section 4 1 NSSDC Information Systems The Automated Internal Management AIM database identifies virtually all launched spacecraft the experiments carried by many of those spacecraft and data sets primarily as archived at NSSDC Tables html tab14 Table 14 identifies the numbers of spacecraft experiments and data sets described in the AIM File along with the numbers of new entries made in 2000 The database serves as the source of information for many of NSSDC s WWW information pages The NSSDC Master Catalog http nssdc gsfc nasa gov nmc sc query html NMC and a number of discipline project pages retrieve information from AIM and build WWW pages on the fly so that the latest information is presented to the user During 2000 there were approximately 137 000 monthly web accesses to the NMC by the public comparable to the prior year s access rate The AIM database also serves as a useful source of comparative information about spacecraft experiments etc such as launch dates time spans of data orbital characteristics time resolution data availability etc The presence of comparative information in a consistent format within a single database makes the database especially valuable for survey reports The NSSDC Supplementary Data File NSDF is similar to AIM but differs from it in that NSDF tracks non spacecraft data multi source spacecraft or other data models and programs and other NSSDC held data sets that do not fit the AIM spacecraft experiment data set hierarchy See Tables html tab15 Table 15 for NSDF statistics The Technical Reference File TRF tracks individual published papers associated with space flight experiments The NSSDC ID for the experiment is attached to the reference information so lists of papers relevant to a particular experiment can be reported and or provided to persons accessing data from a given experiment from NSSDC Tables html tab16 Table 16 shows that 816 papers were newly identified in TRF during 2000 mainly as the result of NSSDC staffers reviewing the Journal of Geophysical Research and the Geophysics Research Letters The TRF was used to generate the Appendix html Appendix listing 65 NSSDC acknowledged papers The Interactive Request and Name Directory IRAND tracks people who have interacted with NSSDC over the years It includes full names one or more addresses telephone and email information and what NSSDC distribution lists they are on The database contains approximately 56 000 entries This information is also accessed and made available through the PIMS interface on the NSSDC WWW Home Page Further IRAND statistics are available as Tables html tab17 Table 17 Note especially that over 7 of the records were updated in 2000 reflecting volatility of such information items as Internet addresses IRAND also tracks individual staff involved requests now more than 80 000 over the years The Interactive Data Archive IDA is another database of interest IDA tracks the inventory of NSSDC s digital data volumes tapes disks etc IDA had 164 425 records at the end of 2000 with 2 723 records having been added during 2000 Clearly there is a wealth of information that has been stored over the years in separate database information systems developed for various purposes The NSSDC is now evolving these databases into a more up to date and consolidated form During 2000 many of the databases such as AIM NSDF and IRAND were merged and migrated to a new dedicated server using the Oracle 8 1 5 operating system New interfaces were developed to make the information more readily available to NSSDC personnel 4 2 NASA Science Office of Standards and Technology NOST http ssdoo gsfc nasa gov nost NOST s mission is to facilitate the recognition and use of standards to reduce cost benefit ratios in the exchange and management of scientific data among NASA entities and the scientific communities they serve NOST s Web Home Page is at http ssdoo gsfc nasa gov nost The NOST strategy is to play a coordinating role in helping the science disciplines identify new standards requirements NOST participates in partnerships with them other agencies and industry on facilitating the adoption of leading edge technologies with national or international visibility that can be tailored to meet NASA science information management and exchange requirements and it assists in the process of moving these technologies toward standards with commercial support 4 2 1 Formats Evolution Process FEP Scientific progress continues to be impeded within some science communities and across the boundaries of traditional discipline domains by the lack of or excessive multiplicity of available standards for data formats and structures A somewhat more subtle adverse effect of this situation is that the commercial software sector is unable to perceive what formats structures it should support e g with applications software This leads to the situation whereby developers and or users of the many available standard formats must develop maintain evolve tools that the commercial sector might otherwise do NOST has established a Formats Evolution Process to address these issues It involves an open dialogue with the relevant communities and the publication of materials and comments via the Web at http ssdoo gsfc nasa gov nost fepc http ssdoo gsfc nasa gov nost fepc Descriptions of many formats and usage experience from researchers archives and projects are included Views from tool developers are also available and there is a Web based forum by which comments may be posted This activity is guided by a Formats Evolution Process Committee which is charged with providing synthesis materials to stimulate community consensus A paper entitled A Possible Time Series Object was prepared and released for community review during 2000 This could lead to an improvement in the way in which data formats are used to convey and describe time series data This may include agreements on needed attributes and even standard services or APIs that time series objects should provide Also under development by the FEPC is a paper establishing an expanded set of terms and concepts enabling more precise discussion of data format features and limitations including their associated software 4 2 2 Consultative Committee for Space Data Systems CCSDS NOST operated NASA s highest level Control Authority office in accordance with the applicable http ccsds org Consultative Committee for Space Data Systems CCSDS and ISO standards to formally archive data descriptions for interchange and long term preservation New descriptions were added for Interball and for NSSDC data sets being migrated into archival packages on new media Currently there are 411 registered data descriptions up from 350 a year ago NOST participated in the development of draft CCSDS ISO standards applicable to multi discipline and sub discipline information interchange The primary standards and their usage categories were ftp nssdc gsfc nasa gov pub ccsds pdf CCSDS 647 0 R 1 pdf Data Entity Dictionary Specification Language DEDSL This draft standard addresses the problem of providing a standard way to document and exchange the various attributes needed to fully define data elements It has been harmonized with the conceptual data element standard from ISO known as ISO 11179 and the ANSI X3 L8 standard known as X3 285 The DEDSL is split into two components one addressing the conceptual model and one addressing interchange forms The conceptual model and an interchange form using the ISO Parameter Value Language PVL have completed formal reviews and will be published this summer An interchange form using XML with DTDs is entering formal review and will be followed by an XML version with XML Schema These standards support the publication and exchange of data Elements and groups of data elements and should lead to more automated access and understanding of data across science disciplines and among organizations ftp nssdc gsfc nasa gov pub ccsds pdf CCSDS 647 0 R 1 pdf Reference Model for an Open Archival Information System OAIS This standard provides a conceptual model of a digital archive including a functional view and an information view and it provides a framework for discussing migration issues and interactions among archives The model establishes initial criteria for recognition of a true archival function and should lead to improved archival implementations provide a basis for further standardization and provide more cost effective vendor support It has been adopted as a starting point in addressing digital preservation issues by a wide variety of organizations around the world The reference model draft has undergone formal agency review as well as review as an ISO Draft International Standard It is under update in response to these comments and is expected to become a full ISO standard in the Fall of 2001 It can be found at http ftp ccsds org ccsds documents pdf CCSDS 650 0 R 1 pdf http ftp ccsds org ccsds documents pdf CCSDS 650 0 R 1 pdf 4 2 3 Flexible Image Transport System FITS Technical Panel and Support Office The Flexible Image Transport System FITS is the standard format for astronomical data interchange endorsed and supervised by the International Astronomical Union IAU NOST participates in the evolution of FITS by commenting on proposed new FITS extensions and conventions and by the development of a formal FITS specification document using the NOST standards accreditation process The http fits gsfc nasa gov FITS Support Office FSO of NSSDC ADF supports the NOST convened FITS Technical Panel including Goddard and extra Goddard FITS experts in its work and supports the community by providing a number of services such as current versions of all documents and WWW information pages During 2000 the IAU FITS Working Group adopted the NOST 100 2 0 document as the IAU s new official FITS standard Other activities of our FITS Support Office included support to the FAME project for FITS usage and discussions with the community to evolve the FITS standards based on our XML development 4 3 Astronomical Data Center In the http adc gsfc nasa gov Astronomical Data Center ADC http adc gsfc nasa gov over 3000 astronomical source catalogs and journal tables are maintained online for easy access Entire catalogs and tables can be retrieved via FTP http tarantella gsfc nasa gov adf visualization design html Web based visualization tools http tarantella gsfc nasa gov adf visualization design html are available for browsing plotting and subsetting the contents of the catalogs and tables before download Users can query interactively for information on individual plotted data points and search for observations made by NASA missions To enable interoperability with other data facilities a http tarantella gsfc nasa gov viewer AEQdoc html programmer s interface http tarantella gsfc nasa gov viewer AEQdoc html has been developed to allow external software to directly access the ADC catalogs without going through the Web browser During 2000 the ADC catalog server experienced over 32 000 accesses per month The server for visualization tools was accessed over 5200 times per month The outflow of data during 2000 exceeded 120 GB and 400 000 files This byte count is nearly 40 times greater than in 1999 evidence of the fact that astronomical catalogs are getting much larger The ADC is currently involved in a research project to define the metadata of an astronomical repository in http tarantella gsfc nasa gov xml eXtensible Markup Language XML http tarantella gsfc nasa gov xml An XML toolbox is being developed for importation enhancement and distribution of data tables and their metadata documents The objective is to enable a more focused search of the ADC data holdings and better support of data exchanges with other data centers In 2000 ADC began releasing test versions of the http xml gsfc nasa gov ADCSoftwareDownload html XML software to the community See http xml gsfc nasa gov ADCSoftwareDownload html 4 4 Common Data Format The http nssdc gsfc nasa gov cdf NSSDC Common Data Format CDF is a self describing data abstraction for the storage and manipulation of multidimensional data in a discipline independent fashion CDF is comprised of three parts the CDF data files that contain both the actual data values and metadata the CDF software library that is used to create access manage manipulate etc CDF files and a well defined Applications Programming Interface known as the CDF Interface that provides transparent access to underlying software and data CDF provides the essential framework for which generic applications e g visualization statistical can easily be created The CDF effort provides a consistency among data formats and structures and allows data to be shared transparently among a variety of projects and applications The http nssdc gsfc nasa gov space istp istp html International Solar Terrestrial Physics ISTP Project is NASA s single largest user of CDF The ISTP Project is using CDF to store its Key Parameter data The http image gsfc nasa gov NASA IMAGE mission launched in 2000 will use CDF extensively We also note that CDF underlies NSSDC s http nssdc gsfc nasa gov omniweb OMNIWeb http nssdc gsfc nasa gov cohoweb COHOWeb http cdaweb gsfc nasa gov CDAWeb and http sscweb gsfc nasa gov SSCWeb services During 2000 NSSDC s CDF office developed Java based programs to provide an alternative way to browse edit and export CDF files These new tools relying on the CDF Java APIs developed in 1999 provide a better graphical user interface GUI through Java language Also a new set of APIs was developed and tested for the Perl language The advent of the CDF Perl APIs just like CDF Java APIs significantly benefits the CDF user community since a CDF application can now be written in popular Perl scripts and run on any one of the Perl supported platforms without modifications This encourages sharing of scientific data analysis code among scientists A World Wide Web WWW page located at http nssdc gsfc nasa gov cdf http nssdc gsfc nasa gov cdf on the Internet provides a description of CDF access to the software distribution documentation papers a list of Frequently Asked Questions and facilitates interaction with the CDF support group at the NSSDC Approximately 21 220 files were FTP downloaded from the CDF directory of NSSDC s anonymous account during 2000 an increase of 33 over 1999 These were mostly files describing CDF software tools from the CDF library etc In addition a great many
