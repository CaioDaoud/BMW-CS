advantage of this feature by selecting the View menu Show Hide Site Navigation Bar Show Only As Needed or Show Always All tables have a caption a summary and properly scoped header cells to allow screen readers to render the table intelligently The NGC website includes a search box access key 4 Links Many links have title attributes which describe the link in greater detail unless the text of the link already fully describes the target Whever possible links are written to make sense out of context Many browsers such as JAWS Home Page Reader Lynx and Opera can extract the list of links on a page and allow the user to browse the list separately from the page Link text is never duplicated two links with the same link text always point to the same address There are no javascript pseudo links All links can be followed in any browser even if scripting is turned off There are no links that open new windows without warning Images All content images used in the home page and all archives include descriptive alternate ALT attributes Purely decorative graphics include null alternate ALT attributes Complex images include long description LONGDESC attributes and links to text only descriptions to explain each image to non visual readers Visual design This site and all its archives use cascading style sheets for visual layout The default stylesheet uses only relative font sizes compatible with the user specified text size option in visual browsers For example if you re using Internet Explorer you can make your default text size larger under the View menu Text Size Larger or Largest A print stylesheet is used to eliminate the need for an additional print page or a text only version If your browser or browsing device does not support stylesheets at all the content of each page is still readable If you encounter any accessibility problems with any page on this site contact us at feedback feedback aspx type Report Feedback info guideline gov with your comments and
