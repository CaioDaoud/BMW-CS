Java Agents for Monitoring and Management JAMM Home Page Data Intensive Distributed Computing Data Intensive Distributed Computing Java Agents for Monitoring and Management JAMM http www didc lbl gov Data Intensive Distributed Computing Group http www lbl gov Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory We are developing software agents to provide a wide range of management and monitoring functions for distributed resources We call this system Java Agents for Monitoring and Management JAMM The ability to monitor and manage distributed computing components is critical for enabling high performance data intensive computing As distributed systems become bigger and more complex there are more pieces to monitor and manage Our approach to this problem is to use a collection of software agents that can perform various administrative tasks Agents can securely start any monitoring program on any host and manage the output of any monitoring data The JAMM system is one of several reference implementations of the Monitoring archetecture being put together by the http dast nlanr net GridForum Perf WG Grid Performace Working Group in the http www gridforum org The Grid Forum About JAMM architecture html Architecture http www didc lbl gov papers JAMM HPDC00 pdf JAMM Paper Using and Programming JAMM userguide user guide html JAMM User Guide programmerguide programmer guide html JAMM Programmer Guide javadoc API Documentation Sample Web based Tools http www itg lbl gov 8088 crowley linux data table html An applet that shows the current values for vmstat netstat and xntp for a set of DPSS hosts http www itg lbl gov 8088 crowley data chart html An applet that keeps a running chart of vmstat netstat and xntp values for a set of DPSS hosts http hpgw lbl gov 8080 cgi bin jamm cgi Status Graphs of Hosts For more information on using JAMM contact Brian Crowley mailto crowley george lbl gov crowley george lbl gov or Brian Tierney mailto bltierney lbl gov BLTierney lbl gov This page is the responsibility of http www itg lbl gov tierney Brian L Tierney mailto bltierney lbl gov BLTierney lbl gov http www itg lbl gov Credits html Support Credits identify the funding sources and the organizational context of the work described in this document http www lbl gov Disclaimers html Disclaimers and Legal Notices apply to this document and its uses and access to and uses of the system on which it resides at LBL Like any Web page it may be linked with pages and systems beyond LBL jurisdiction Their contents and uses are the responsibility of their authors and administrators Credits The research and development of the Distributed Systems Department i s funded by the U S Dept of Energy Office of Science Office of Advanced Scie ntific Computing Research Mathematical Information and Computational Sciences Division If there is a problem with this page please e mail mailto webmaster www itg lbl gov webmaster www itg lbl gov http www didc lbl gov DIDC PAGE http www lbl gov LBL HOME PAGE This page last modified Thursday 06 Jul 2000 18 49 41 PDT
