arena to be housed permanently at the Carnegie Mellon Robotics Institute to enable researchers to test their robot platforms and software algorithms The arena made its debut at the RoboCup Rescue event part of the RoboCup American Open held at CMU April 30 May 4 MEL Programs Featured In Mechanical Engineering Magazine The September issue of Mechanical Engineering magazine published by the American Society of Mechanical Engineers ASME contains a feature article on Intelligent Tools This article highlights the objectives and activities of the MEL Smart Machine Tools and the MEL Intelligent Open Architecture Controls programs The article includes quotes from MEL researchers Hans Soons Kang Lee and Fred Proctor and a picture of Brad Damazo The article steps through in significant detail the five components expected of a smart machine tool as defined by Hans Soons The article concludes with an announcement of the upcoming NIST workshop on December 9 11 2002 to further define industry needs and priorities for smart machine tools The article can be viewed online at http www nist gov cgi bin exit nist cgi url http www memagazine org contents current features
