Lessons and activities for this article by NASAexplores The Human Advantage September 23 2003 Bruce McCandless on spacewalk Bruce McCandless uses a maneuvering unit on a spacewalk Before Neil Armstrong ever set foot on the lunar surface exploration of the Moon was already under way Space probes such as orbiters and landers had already been conducting scientific research years before the first humans landed there Today robotic spacecraft have visited every planet in the solar system except for Pluto and plans are under way for a mission there Satellites help scientists on the ground learn more about our home planet Earth Robots and automated experiments are capable of making incredible contributions to scientific research in space So why do we need human beings up there anyway There are several good answers to that question While machines are capable of doing an amazing number of things today there are still many things they cannot do That s where people play an important role in space exploration When astronauts go into space they can bring special tools with them not to mention human hands but most importantly the world s most versatile computer the human mind Of the importance of having people in space astronaut Fred Leslie a payload specialist scientist who flew on the Shuttle on STS 73 said People bring with them a certain experience in dealing with the unexpected When an unanticipated problem arises nothing is as good as human ingenuity for figuring out how to solve it An astronaut service Hubble Astronauts have gone on several missions to improve the Hubble Space Telescope One advantage of having humans in space is that they can improve and repair equipment that machines cannot For example visits to the Hubble Space Telescope have allowed new scientific instruments to be installed on the orbiting observatory These upgrades have greatly increased its productivity by allowing it to see things it would not have seen without them The enhancements have made the Hubble s vision up to 10 times better than it was when it was launched And of course the International Space Station ISS which is far too big to assemble on the ground is an excellent example of the amazing facilities that can be created by human construction workers in orbit Human operators provide the finesse needed for the Canadarm robot to move Station modules into place And astronauts in space suits perform the detailed work of connecting the many components that will eventually form the ISS The completion of the Station will involve more than two and a half times as many space walks as were performed during the entire pre ISS history of spaceflight Another advantage of having people in space is that we can better understand human biology by studying the effects microgravity has on the human body Large amounts of research have already been conducted on how spaceflight affects the human brain heart lungs bones muscles and other body parts This research has two major benefits Most obviously it helps researchers prepare for improvements to human spaceflight in the future With the ISS astronauts are staying in orbit longer than they ever have before so this research is helping them to stay healthy while they are in space and when they return to Earth Someday people will go on even longer space missions as they travel beyond Earth orbit and may eventually visit other planets For that to happen scientists have to understand how the human body will react to these new experiences John Glen undergoes tests John Glenn underwent several medical tests during his Space Shuttle flight But studying humans in space does not only benefit the astronauts while they are in space There are also benefits to space based research here on Earth as well Studying problems that occur in microgravity can help researchers better understand similar problems on Earth And finding solutions for spaceflight related problems can help people suffering from related maladies on Earth Research on keeping astronauts fit in space has led to the development of new fitness techniques for Earth Space suit technology to protect astronauts from the vacuum of space is also used to protect children suffering from a potentially lethal sensitivity to ultraviolet radiation called hypohidrotic ectodermal dysplasia Researchers anticipate that studies on how to provide for emergency blood transfusions for astronauts will produce artificial blood cells that can be used on the ground as well Astronauts are also important to science experiments conducted in orbit While some science experiments are automated others still require physical interaction by an astronaut And even automated experiments can sometimes greatly benefit from a human hand and mind If a moving part of an experiment blocks a camera if a vibration disrupts an experiment or if equipment malfunctions an astronaut can fix a problem that might otherwise prevent any scientific results from being obtained Harrison Schmitt on the Moon Geologist Harrison Schmitt helped make Apollo 17 one of the most successful lunar missions Machines are capable of doing only what they have been programmed to do The human mind however can analyze a situation and adjust plans accordingly Although numerous space probes had already explored the Moon the landings of the Apollo program were able to bring back a wealth of new scientific information This was because the astronauts involved were able to explore their surroundings and find interesting samples One of the astronauts on Apollo 17 the last Moon landing was geologist Harrison Schmitt He was able to utilize his education to find lunar samples that had never been seen Astronauts bring that same invaluable flexibility and ingenuity to today s Shuttle and Space Station research Another benefit of human spaceflight might have less obvious concrete advantages but the intangible benefits are enormous At a time when the number of students entering engineering and other technical fields is on the decline astronauts serve as ambassadors for the sciences Their exciting experiences can inspire young people to become not only the explorers of tomorrow but also the engineers scientists researchers and mathematicians People are inherently curious and want to explore but that exploration does not come without risks When the crew of Apollo 13 returned to Earth safely after their potentially tragic mission the President of the United States captured the importance of humans in spaceflight Their safe return is a triumph of the human spirit of those special qualities of man himself we rely on when machines fail and that we rely on also for those things that machines cannot do Source http www NASAexplores com NASAexplores Missions To The Moon So much about the Moon has not been understood until recently relatively speaking People have stared up at it wondering how far away it is or what it is made of or do other people like us live there Many of the answers have come from observing the Moon from a distance but our observations also have brought more questions To answer these new questions unmanned probes were sent to the Moon The Ranger and Surveyor Programs were the first American effort to study the Moon The Ranger Program attempted to send nine missions to the Moon from 1961 1965 However only three of those missions Ranger 7 8 and 9 actually made it there and sent back data Mechanical and software problems caused the first six missions to either crash into the Moon without sending back data miss the Moon entirely or to never leave Earth orbit The Ranger s three successes were designed to take pictures until it crashed into the Moon They were not to land but to take close up pictures as they encountered crashed into the Moon The Surveyor Program was NASA s first attempt to actually land safely on the Moon The Surveyors made trips to the Moon from 1966 1968 There were seven Surveyor probes sent to the Moon Only two of those did not work properly while the other five showed that a soft landing could be made on the Moon This was done in prelude to the upcoming Apollo missions to the Moon Each Surveyor carried more scientific equipment than its predecessor so it continued to push our knowledge of the Moon Finally the Apollo Program sent men to land on the Moon from 1969 1972 The experiments that they ran there once again increased our knowledge about the Moon The machines did a great job but it was the human will spirit and experience that led us to a better understanding of the Moon More New Science http liftoff msfc nasa gov news 2003 news human asp The Human Advantage http liftoff msfc nasa gov news 2003 news Walheim asp Rex Walheim Space Station Construction Worker
