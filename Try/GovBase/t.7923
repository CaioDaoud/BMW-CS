amount Both foreclosures and deficiency judgments could seriously affect your ability to qualify for credit in the future So you should avoid foreclosure if possible Q What Should I Do DO NOT IGNORE

too good to be true usually are If you re selling your home without professional guidance beware of buyers who try to rush you through the process Unfortunately there are people who may try to take advantage of your financial difficulty Be especially alert to the following Equity skimming In this type of scam a buyer approaches you offering to get you out of financial trouble by promising to pay off your mortgage or give you a sum of money when the property is sold The buyer may suggest that you move out quickly and deed the property to him or her The buyer then collects rent for a time does not make any mortgage payments and allows the lender to foreclose Remember signing over your deed to someone else does not necessarily relieve you of your obligation on your loan Phony counseling agencies Some groups calling themselves counseling agencies may approach you and offer to perform certain services for a fee These could well be services you could do for yourself for free such as negotiating a new payment plan with your lender or pursuing a pre foreclosure sale If you have any doubt about paying for such services call a HUD approved offices hsg sfh hcc hccprof14 cfm housing
