of these two frontiers by Taylor Sisk We describe Aquarius as a window into the ocean says director Steven Miller It certainly affords a spectacular view Diver outside of NOAA s Aquarius at 65 feet

National Undersea Research Center at the University of North Carolina at Wilmington It s located three miles from shore off Tavernier Florida in the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary NOAA s Aquarius is cool And it s accessible Web casts of Aquarius missions are viewed in classrooms and aquariums across the world and its http www uncw edu aquarius Web site provides live Web cam coverage during missions We describe Aquarius as a window into the ocean says director Steven Miller Scientific research is certainly the foundation and priority for NOAA s Aquarius Each year NOAA s Undersea Research Program provides funding to scientists to come to NOAA s Aquarius to pursue their particular research interests as they relate to NOAA s mission Beyond the scientific research and in conjunction with it says Miller Aquarius is about outreach and education And assisting in this regard in raising NOAA s and Aquarius public profile are missions NOAA s Undersea Research Program has been conducting over the past three years in collaboration with NASA National Aeronautics and Space Administration ANALOGOUS EXTREMES NASA and NOAA share much in common most particularly the environments in which they operate Within Aquarius and in depths of a hundred feet and more around it space station astronauts now experience the only truly analogous environment to that which they will encounter in space Bill Todd is a NASA simulations supervisor For 17 years he s been training astronauts in a great variety of environments This is not at all a simulation says Todd of Aquarius That s the wonderful thing about it Our people get simulation experience but they don t get a lot of human behavioral type lessons We ve done different things like at the National Outdoor Leadership School and Cold Lake in Canada where we send people out for a week in the wild But prior to the recent Aquarius missions we hadn t been doing anything like this at all NOAA s Aquarius America s Innerspace Station NOAA s Aquarius America s Innerspace Station NASA s work with NOAA s Aquarius is in fact the revival of an earlier ocean space initiative In 1965 while on leave from NASA Scott Carpenter one of the original seven Mercury astronauts the Right Stuff guys participated in a Navy Sea Lab project spending 30 days living and conducting experiments some 200 feet in the deep off the coast of California I was curious about the ocean says Carpenter today and how technology could be transferred It s more arduous and not as glamorous underwater It s bitter cold and dark But they resemble each other in terms of isolation and confinement and that in both you re out of your element There are a lot of mysteries involved in living and working underwater We answered lots of questions and brought back some new clues Carpenter was a friend of Bill Todd s dad Todd had been working for NASA in astronaut training for 10 years when Carpenter began introducing him to people in the undersea community It really started to jell Todd recalls and I saw there was a real potential value in undersea habitats So we got introduced to Dr Miller here and were able to put the program together MISSIONS EVOLVE The first NASA Extreme Environment Mission Operations NEEMO mission was conducted in October 2001 NASA astronaut at work under the sea with a familiar cartoon character at his side NASA astronaut at work under the sea with a familiar cartoon character at his side We did our first test with a crew loaded with experience says Todd super veteran space fliers They came back saying This is the best thing short of space flight that there could possibly be For scientists and astronauts alike Aquarius offers a unique experience in several regards It allows them to live and work on the seafloor for extended periods using http www uncw edu aquarius saturation htm saturation diving technology which significantly increases the time divers can spend working in ocean depths and provides them with much more convenient access to tools and computers An underwater laboratory such as NOAA s Aquarius allows scientists to observe and study the subjects of their research in real time Aquarius is supported by a buoy on the surface that provides power life support and communications and by a 24 hour shore based mission control Four NASA astronauts and two Aquarius technicians pose inside Aquarius bunkroom during the June 2003 mission Four NASA astronauts and two Aquarius technicians pose inside Aquarius bunkroom during the June 2003 mission NEEMO missions are now conducted for both experienced and novice space fliers The longest mission to date 14 days was conducted this past June by a four person NASA team and two Aquarius support technicians There have been five missions thus far A 45 day mission is now being discussed The program has grown says Todd Now they re going on full blown undersea research missions You re in an extreme environment and you have to be careful you have to follow procedures you have to work together you have to use your training The missions have gotten more and more complex such that now it looks like a space mission in virtually every facet all the little housekeeping things that have to go on during the day task lists of 30 plus items that have to be done They eat space food they talk with their families This will never be the perfect analog Todd allows it can t be But we re making it pretty close we really are in every possible way It takes 16 hours to go through decompression to get back to the surface from Aquarius You can t go back to the surface without that decompression If you do you re going to get bent you re going to get hurt You may be down there and look up and say Hey there s the surface right there It s the same as in space You can sit there and look out the window and it s gorgeous and there s the Earth It takes about 17 hours to de orbit from the space station That s a very close analog Moreover Todd explains Having a facility from which you can conduct research working as a proxy scientist is huge Astronauts aren t always scientists per say but they re doing proxy science for a principal investigator located in another place There s methodology to learn on how to be a good proxy scientist on how to make sure you get that science completed for that investigator the best that you can We can practice that function here aboard NOAA s Aquarius and develop those relationships before an experiment ever goes into space Nowhere else do we get the opportunity to have real astronauts in a real extreme environment doing real scientific research on experiments that haven t gone into space yet Having been tested here the potential for success skyrockets Among those experiments is calibration testing of equipment to shut out white noise Another is experimentation with nutrition another examines the duplication of viruses in extreme environments NASA astronaut collecting data on coral reef health NASA astronaut collecting data on coral reef health The astronauts also perform a variety of training exercises outside Aquarius For example they take coordinates and map an area or test the quality of a communications system If we go to Mars Todd explains the first thing we re going to do is set up camp It s like going camping you ve got to set up your tent you ve got to find where the water supply is you want to see what natural resources are available It s the same thing with the first couple of dives on a NEEMO mission You learn the topography of the reef you take measurements with your compass you take pictures you write on your slate and you communicate that information back to the mission control center in Houston Then there are team building and leadership exercises to give an astronaut the opportunity to step up and given the tools and given the requirements show their leadership skills and demonstrate and execute a plan in an extreme environment And as the astronauts are learning about space from the ocean they re conducting research for NOAA most recently collecting data on the health of coral reef It s a good NOAA NASA crossover thing Todd affirms It s strong in every possible way a strong relationship And it turns out that the coral work is also an excellent skills test in itself They have to come up with a plan they think they re going to get more done than they actually can So they go back and talk about how to better attack it A COOL JOB Viewing the fish from inside Aquarius View from inside the Aquarius It took a long time says Scott Carpenter of this NOAA NASA cooperative The potential is just now being realized It s in the charter of NOAA to work with outside agencies like NOAA Todd says and we re doing just that What better organization to be working with than NOAA s Undersea Research Program Center The Johnson Space Center and human space flight is to NASA what NOAA s Undersea Research Program is to NOAA and we re working together People are coming out of the woodwork with these wonderful ideas and concepts of how they could use this as a platform The educational outreach opportunities for both NOAA and NASA with NOAA s Aquarius are huge It s a very visual environment The kids see it and they see an astronaut and an aquanaut working together in the habitat talking about what a cool job they have We really need to capitalize on that opportunity Links about NOAA NASA missions in NOAA s Aquarius http www uncw edu aquarius archive 2001 10 2001 expd htm Mission 1 http www uncw edu aquarius archive 2001 10
