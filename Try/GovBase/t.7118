Number of Beam Pulses Delivered in the Linac Recently Number of Beam Pulses Delivered in the Linac Recently The number of beam pulses in the Linac are counted each 24 hour period ending at about 00 01 each day e g from 00 01 00 to 00 00 59 every day This is the number of beam pulses delivered through the Linac each day for the last 120 days The corresponding average rate of beam production for the Linac over this period is The number of beam pulses lost per day in the high energy half of the Linac during this period is Percent of pulses lost per day The log of beam pulses delivered from the Linac since records were first recorded Note the log scale on these plots A lost beam pulse is defined to be a pulse that has less than half of the beam current out of the Linac than was put into the 805 MHz portion of the Linac On a good day without any Linac studies pulses we will have on the order of 28000 stacking pulses It is difficult at this time to determine how many of the rest of these pulses are going to MiniBOOne and how many are just studies pulses In 24 hours there are 24 hours day 3600 seconds hour 15 pulses second 1 296 000 RF cycles in the Linac each capable of delivering Linac beam http linac fnal gov Return to the Linac Home Page mailto mccrory garlic fnal gov Elliott McCrory Last modified Tue Jul 29 08 18 32 CDT 2003
