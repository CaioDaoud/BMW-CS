Artificial Economies Problem top top Whether they are spacecraft probes or rovers coordinating multiple distributed agents introduces unique challenges for automated planning and other supporting technology Mataric 1995 Parker 1998 Issues arise concerning interfaces between agents communication bandwidth group command and control and onboard capabilities For example a certain level of communication capabilities will need to be assigned to each possibly limiting the amount of information that can be shared between the rovers and ground The mission design will need to include a chain of command for the team of spacecraft rovers indicating which rovers are controlled directly from the ground and which are controlled by other rovers or orbiting landed spacecraft Finally the onboard capabilities will need to be considered including computing power and onboard data storage capacity This will limit the level of autonomy each of the rovers can have Impact top top While it is up to mission designers to determine the optimal number of rovers for a given mission multiple rovers have three types of advantages over single rover approaches force multiplication simultaneous presence and system redundancy Force multiplication Multiple rovers can perform certain types of tasks more quickly than a single rover such as performing a geological survey of a region or deploying a network of seismographic instruments We call these cooperative tasks Simultaneous presence Multiple rovers can perform tasks that are impossible for a single rover We call these coordinated tasks Certain types of instruments such as interferometers require simultaneous presence at different locations Rovers landed at different locations can cover areas with impassable boundaries Using communication relays a line of rovers can reach longer distances without loss of contact More complicated coordinated tasks can also be accomplished such as those involved in hardware construction or repair System redundancy Multiple rovers can be used to enhance mission success through increased system redundancy Several rovers with the same capability may have higher acceptable risk levels allowing one rover for example to venture farther despite the possibility of not returning Also because designing a single rover to survive a harsh environment for a long periods of time can be difficult using multiple rovers may enable missions that a single rover could not survive long enough to accomplish Status top top Integration with Multi rover testbed ASPEN is currently available for external licensing Click
