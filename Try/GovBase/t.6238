how far away GRBs were to within a factor of a few billion docs dict jp html light year light years But now a slew of satellite observations follow up ground based observations and theoretical work have allowed astronomers to link GRBs to supernovae in distant galaxies In this series of articles we will explore what what astronomers know about gamma ray bursts what they think causes them the
