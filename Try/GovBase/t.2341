Wireless Telecommunications Bureau The National Coordination Committee NCC was established by the Commission to solicit input from the public safety community in the further development of rules governing the new 700 MHz public safety band particularly in regard to interoperability The work of the NCC is extremely important for many reasons including the fact that this new band is supposed to satisfy public safety communications needs into the 21st century and is intended to provide the capability for a nationwide public safety interoperability communications system Consequently the public and in particular the public safety community is encouraged to actively participate in the NCC The goal of this Internet site is to make information on the NCC easily available to all concerned We welcome your comments and suggestions NCC CHARTER EXPIRES The NCC held its final meeting in Washington D C on July 17 2003 The NCC s charter expired on July 25 2003 Accordingly membership applications are no longer being accepted We anticipate that a summary of the NCC s activities will be given by the NCC Chair Kathy Wallman as part of the September 10 2003 9 30 a m agenda meeting of the
