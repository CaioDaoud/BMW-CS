PHOBOS is one of the four particle detectors at Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider It will study the re enactment of the evolution of the universe a micro second after the Big Bang by analyzing the particles emerging from a collision of gold nuclei moving nearly at the speed of light physics detector accelerator collider phobos RHIC heavy ion high energy gold nucleus gold nucleii gold Brookhaven particle physics nuclear physics quark gluon plasma qgp quantum chromo dynamics qcd Microsoft FrontPage 4 0 FrontPage Editor Document Phobos Experiment at RHIC scripts postinfo asp phobos main css search htm Private index htm Detectors index htm index htm Detectors ASP Counting House Portal asp index htm Home Detectors index htm Detector Private index htm Internal search htm Search slides index htm Click here for slides overview htm Overview of Project Brookhaven rhic htm Brookhaven Info Collaboration index htm Contacting Collaboration Calendar index htm Schedules images Pictures Publications index htm Publications Presentations index htm Presentations Detectors Computing index htm Computing mirror htm Mirror sites Copyright 2003 by the Phobos Collaboration All rights reserved Contact mailto wyslouch mit edu webmaster with questions or comments Recent News recent news htm Read about the Phobos participation in the June 18 2003 BNL colloquium and press conference on d Au data Note that the PHOBOS d Au results with tables of data are now Publications Physics dAu first index htm posted Gold Gold Ion Collision at PHOBOS at highest RHIC energies 100 GeV nucleon A spectacular Gold Gold collision at the maximum RHIC energy as seen by Phobos Phobos consists of a cylindrical array of silicon detectors and two spectrometer arms surrounding the interaction region where the gold nuclei collide The colored dots show the locations where silicon was struck by the thousands of produced particles The red lines are reconstructed trajectories of some of those particles The precise location where the nuclei collided can clearly be seen images Results kaboom 100 gif Counting charged particles Average number of charged particles per nucleon measured at about 90 degrees to the beam direction as a function of center of mass of colliding ions images Results phobos measurements jpg http www bnl gov bnlweb pubaf pr bnlpr071801 htm Brookhaven Press Release http www bnl gov bnlweb security notice html Privacy and Security Notice http home netscape com comprod mirror index html now button gif 840 bytes http www microsoft com ie logo asp ie4get animated gif 7090 bytes
