million square miles the largest such area ever observed Although production of ozone destroying gases has been curtailed under international agreements concentrations of the gases in the stratosphere are only now reaching their peak Researchers believe it may be many decades before the ozone hole is no longer an annual occurrence Using data from NASA s TOMS Instrument scientists are continuing to

Endeavour served as an Earth observatory early in 2000 during STS 99 The Shuttle Radar Topography Mission was a breakthrough in the science of remote sensing and produced topographic maps of Earth 30 times as precise as the best global maps in use today The information collected will help produce one of the most comprehensive and accurate maps of Earth ever assembled See the movie as a ftp ftp hq
