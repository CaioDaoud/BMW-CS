Earthquake List NB The official magnitude for this earthquake is indicated at the top of this page This was the best available estimate of the earthquake s size at the time that this page was created Other magnitudes associated with web pages linked from here are those determined at various times following the earthquake with different types of seismic data Although given the data used they are legitimate estimates of magnitude they are not considered the official magnitude The region name is an automatically generated name from the Flinn Engdahl F E seismic and geographical regionalization scheme The boundaries of these regions are defined at one degree intervals and therefore differ from irregular political boundaries neis epic fer explain html More http www doi gov U S Department of
