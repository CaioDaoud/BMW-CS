World Data Center for Oceanography Tianjin China Oceanographic data contributed to the WDC become automatically available to scientific investigators in any country Thus there can be no restrictions or limitations placed on data exchanged through the WDC system However for certain types of data the exchange of inventories of available data in a WDC subcenter may be considered acceptable in lieu of the transfer of the actual data sets Publications and Data Products All data received by WDC for Oceanography are described in the annual Catalogue of Data and Report of Data Exchange The scientific community is kept apprised of the availability of data and publications from the WDC through regular dissemination of the catalogue to organizations and individuals in more than 75 countries and as appropriate to qualified requesters WDC for Oceanography is operated by the U S NODC OC5 Ocean Climate Laboratory and NODC provides support for all required computer operations Data
