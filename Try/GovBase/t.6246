method In this method the difference between a ship s dead reckoned position determined from its previous position determined from a navigational fix is ascribed solely to the effect of surface

Chesapeake Bay Region 1984 1989 CD ROM shows changes in land cover for this region over the 5 year interval from 1984 to 1988 89 The data set is the result of a multi year effort that has focused on the Chesapeake Bay as a prototype for the Coastal Change Analysis Program C CAP of the NOAA Coastal Ocean Program s Estuarine Habitat Studies Program The Coastal Ocean Program has additional information on C CAP The CD ROM was produced cooperatively by the NOAA National Marine Fisheries Service National Geophysical Data Center and National Oceanographic Data Center This Chesapeake Bay data set constitutes one of the largest change detection efforts ever attempted covering an area of approximately 30 000 square miles with a source data resolution of 30 meters by 30 meters Its greatest value is in its synoptic coverage and consistent classification over such a large area The data set is based on an analysis of Images figure1 gif Landsat Thematic Mapper TM scenes of the Chesapeake Bay area GeoVu display software is included on the CD ROM and will operate on any IBM PC AT or compatible personal computer with MS Windows Version 3 1 and a compatible CD ROM reader NOTE

have compiled from the NODC Oceanographic Station Data File a set of oceanographic data having repetitive samples along ocean sections or at fixed stations for long time periods These oceanographic station time series include temperature salinity density and nutrient data The total time series data set contains 27 North Pacific sections 56 North Atlantic sections sections along coastal California from the California Cooperative Fisheries Investigations CALCOFI 19 sections from other ocean regions and data from the 10 Ocean Weather Stations The CD ROM contains both data and inventory files Each inventory file is sorted by NODC Reference Number The data on this disc are stored as ASCII records in the NODC Oceanographic Station Data SD2 format CDR detdesc time series html More

Altimeter Crossover Differences from the Geodetic Mission 8 discs The first 18 months of Geosat operations April 1985 to September 1986 were referred to as the Geodetic Mission Except for data south of 30 S that has been de classified and released by the Navy data from the Geosat Geodetic Mission were collected for military use and are classified The altimeter crossover differences from the Geodetic Mission are unclassified however and are contained on this set of eight CD ROMs in the form of crossover difference records XDRs Although only the 18 month Geodetic Mission data are classified XDRs were constructed for the first 2 5 years of the Geosat mission that is data from the Geodetic Mission plus the first year of the Exact Repeat Mission This was done to minimize the effect of the 5 week data gap October 1 to November 8 1986 between the two missions The GEOSAT Altimeter Crossover Difference data are organized by geographic region see General CDR detdesc xovermap html map The data are in a binary Hewlett Packard format but each disc contains a module that enables the data to be converted to binary VAX format The Geosat altimeter crossover difference records are documented in a NOAA handbook a copy of which is provided with each order Note Foreign requesters must follow special procedures when ordering Geosat data Please contact NODC for further

provide customers with data selected from its archive data files on recordable CD ROMs Because a CD ROM can hold up to 650 megabytes of data there is substantial cost savings when large data sets are provided on a single CD ROM versus multiple tapes or diskettes top Back to top General NODC About contact html Contact NODC http www adobe com products acrobat readstep html click to get adobe acrobat
