docs dict ad html astrophysics Astrophysics a new research group is devoting their collective effort to understanding and detecting gravitational waves Scientists are creating computer programs to model gravitational waves that will be detected by a NASA ESA mission called LISA Laser Interferometer Space Antenna General Relativity In 1916 docs dict ei html einstein Albert Einstein published his famous Theory of docs dict ei html general relativity General Relativity His theory describes how spacetime is affected by docs dict jp html mass mass We can think of spacetime as a fabric that bends or curves when we place an object on it Keep in mind that the 2 dimensional fabric analogy is just a model we use to represent what is actually 4 dimensional spacetime the normal three dimensions of space plus a fourth dimension of time artist s concept of the sun causing a curve in the sheet of spacetime Illustration showing the affect the mass of the Sun has on spacetime Imagine pulling a sheet taut and placing a bowling ball in the center of it you will notice that the ball produces a curve in the sheet The curve is weak far away from the ball and steeper near the ball In fact the sheet is a bit stretched in that area near the ball as well This situation describes the curvature of spacetime and how it is affected by mass Near a mass spacetime curves more drastically and stretches Near a very large mass the dent in spacetime is very deep and the stretches are near the breaking point This means that since spacetime stretches near a mass not only is space stretched out but so is time What do you think would happen if you put something extremely heavy on the sheet Obviously you might have a hard time holding the sheet up but imagine that you had some help from Superman The heavy object would break through the sheet In space this is what we call a docs dict ad html black hole black hole The mass is so large that anything that comes near it even docs dict jp html light light falls through the hole and is never able to return So What is a Gravitational Wave artist concept of gravitational waves The binary system at the center of this animation creates graviational waves that propagate outward away from the source Most scientists describe gravitational waves as ripples in spacetime Just like a boat sailing through the ocean produces waves in the water moving masses like docs dict qz html star stars or black holes produce gravitational waves in the fabric of spacetime A more massive moving object will produce more powerful waves and objects that move very quickly will produce more waves over a certain time period Where Do Gravitational Waves Come From Gravitational waves are usually produced in an interaction between two or more compact masses Such interactions include the binary docs dict jp html orbit orbit of two black holes a merge of two docs dict ei html galaxy galaxies or two docs dict jp html neutron star neutron stars orbiting each other As the black holes stars or galaxies orbit each other they send out waves of docs dict ei html gravity gravitational radiation that reach the Earth However once the waves do get to the Earth they are extremely weak This is because gravitational waves like water waves decrease in strength as they move away from the source This strength decrease occurs because the energy that propagates from the source is spread out over larger and larger areas causing the signal to thin out Even though they are weak gravitational waves can travel unobstructed within the fabric of spacetime unlike light which is obstructed by matter This how gravitational radiation is able to reach the Earth and provide us with information that light cannot give How Can We Detect Gravitational Waves artist concept of LISA LISA docs dict jp html laser Laser Interferometer Space Antenna NASA s space based observatory will use interferometry to detect gravitational waves Since the waves are so weak when they reach us scientists had to use their imaginations to come up with instruments sensitive enough to detect such slight variations in spacetime Interferometry is the technique scientists and engineers use to detect small stretches in spacetime The technique requires test masses to be set at a large distance from each other Lasers make continuous measurements to monitor the change in distance between the masses The masses are free to move so that when a gravitational wave passes the distance between the masses will fluctuate That is spacetime will be stretched The lasers record this variation in distance and the scientists know that a wave has passed There are currently several ground based interferometer detectors in operation or under construction including LIGO USA VIRGO Italy France GEO Germany Great Britain ACIGA Australia and TAMA Japan The space based observatory LISA is scheduled to launch in 2011 In order to detect gravitational waves it is necessary to create a model of what the incoming waveform might look like Since there are so many sources at a given time scientists must create computer models of gravitational waves so they know what to look for in what seems like a huge mess of data Dr Joan Centrella a theoretical astrophysicist at NASA s Goddard Space Flight Center leads a team of scientists who create these models Currently the group is working on computer models of massive black hole coalescences that occur when the black holes at the centers of two colliding galaxies spiral into each other Once we have the models for this system we can just substitute different masses for the black holes That way several models can be made from one program says Dr Centrella What Will We Learn From the Detectors Gravitational waves will help physicists and astronomers to understand some of the most fundamental laws of physics They will also tell us about the dynamics of large scale events in the docs dict qz html universe Universe like the death of stars and the birth of black holes With LISA scientists hope to probe through space and time to observe the Universe just a fraction of a second after the docs dict ad html big bang Big Bang Using this information we may be able to learn more about how the Universe began and evolved as well as what might be in store for the future star docs features exhibit lisa exhibit html See what else LISA
