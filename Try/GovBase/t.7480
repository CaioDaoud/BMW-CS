Facilities Capabilities Book ED Facilities Capabilities antenna Avionics structures Structures Mechanics Thermal engineering Engineering Systems Avionics Antenna Range Test Facility http avionics msfc nasa gov AntennaRange index html The Antenna Range Test Facility is a large radio frequency test facility comprising several functions and is located east of Rideout Road approximately 1 mile south of Redstone Arsenal s Gate 9 This facility performs VSWR insertion impedance measurements and antenna radiation distribution pattern measurements in support of the development qualification and acceptance of antenna systems associated with space flight hardware The Antenna Range Test Facility provides MSFC with the capability of performing accurate measurements of impedance insertion loss isolation frequency power and antenna radiation distribution patterns between 10 MHz and 40 GHz The facility utilizes both a 400 foot and a 2 640 foot range to measure far field antenna radiation distribution patterns on scale models of spacecraft and or payloads Antenna pattern data on all ranges can be recorded in analog or digital form and presented in polar or rectangular form The facility also has a 120 X 30 X 30 foot tapered anechoic chamber A small onsite machine shop is used for construction of items needed in tests such as small model antennas ground planes and mounting brackets The shop and offices for test engineers are located in building 4194 which also serves as the primary control monitor center for antenna measurements There is also a building with a roof top radome which provides a free space environment for some antenna measurements and protects personnel and equipment from the weather top Top of Page Structures Mechanics Thermal Structural Dynamics Test Facility The http smtd msfc nasa gov ed27 html Structural Strength and Dynamics Test Facility provides test evaluation and simulation capability required by flight hardware development programs and supporting research and technology initiatives It consists of laboratory equipment and infrastructure for the structural and dynamics test disciplines of static strength vibration modal vibro acoustics and transient shock MSFC NASA flight vehicle and payload hardware is tested to requirements of launch criteria with an emphasis in deriving test article stress and dynamic properties verification of analytical models and certification of flight units to withstand lift off and reentry static and dynamic loads Test article boundary constraints input forcing functions and response parameter measurements are tailored to specific test article characteristics Test methodologies are developed or expanded as required to accommodate full scale testing associated with unprecedented structural design concepts new materials and payload mission objectives Institutional capabilities are in place for optimum support of test activities including full scale tests using support structure anchored to bedrock for maximum stiffness real time data processing computational networks and test beds with multiple degree of freedom configurations top Top of Page Environmental Test Facility The http smtd msfc nasa gov ed26 html Environmental Test Facility provides wide range of simulated environments for development qualification and acceptance testing of space flight hardware The facility located in the West End of Building 4619 provides the capability for thermal vacuum vacuum bakeout optical cleanliness bakeout thermal humidity and thermal altitude testing Simulated environments include extreme conditions related to shipping ground storage ascent descent and on orbit conditions Vacuum down to 5 x 10 8 torr is possible with temperatures ranging from 185 to 200 C The facility consists of thirteen thermal vacuum chambers six thermal humidity chambers one thermal altitude chamber and two Class 10K clean rooms with capabilities to accommodate various requirements for size and function The largest vacuum chamber is 28 ft in length and 20 ft in diameter it can accommodate flight articles up to 15 tons Environmental testing services include functional test support of flight articles thermal cycling to verify workmanship and thermal balance for thermal model correlation Around the clock support is provided on a regular basis to accommodate critical schedule milestones The ETF Team stands ready to provide any testing support required to ensure the safe reliable operation of space flight hardware top Top of Page Engineering Systems Environments Data Analysis Center EDAC The http esd msfc nasa gov ED44 ED44services html Environments Data Analysis Center EDAC is configured to provide conference workstation and data server space to support the acquisition analysis archiving and communication of space and terrestrial environment data It is also used for a number of research and data analysis activities The EDAC served as the Leonids Environment Operations Center a real time data analysis hub for a worldwide network of NASA and U S Air Force observers of the 1999 Leonid Meteor Storm The EDAC will also house the Mission Science Team for the ProSEDS tether mission in late 2000 top Top of Page MSFC EMI Test Facility METF The MSFC http esd msfc nasa gov ED44 ED44services html Electromagnetic Interference EMI Test Facility provides EMI testing services including the performance of both developmental and qualification EMI testing of avionics to military Space Shuttle International Space Station ISS and other space platform specifications EMI test data developmental or EMI test reports qualification are provided to the customer The METF provides facilities and engineering technical support for EMI testing of space systems subsystems and equipment The facility consists of two chambers one 24 X 28 and the other 20 X 28 The larger chamber is capable of testing ISS racks A portable EMI tent is available for testing at remote or offsite locations area shape rect coords 279 31 411 51 http www nasa gov about highlights HP Privacy html alt NASA Privacy Statement title NASA Privacy Statement http www nasa gov
