COMPACT HTM Multistate Tax Compact is to promote uniformity or compatibility in significant components of tax systems The Multistate Tax Commission develops a uniformity proposal a recommendation to its member States and other States by the following described process when the proposal has a significant potential impact on the proper treatment of income or transactions involving multistate commerce While in some instances the development of a particular uniformity proposal may involve some additional steps an understanding of the description given below will impart an appreciation that a uniformity proposal is not adopted without formal action of the Commission following stages during which public participation is sought Only after Step Eight does a true Commission proposal exist Even at the completion of the Step Eight actual adoption of the proposal requires the affirmative action of the States Step Nine The uniformity process typically proceeds as follows Step One When requested by the Uniformity Committee which is comprised of state revenue agency personnel appointed annually by their directors of revenue the staff develops an exploratory draft of the issue under study Step Two The Uniformity Committee reviews the staff draft and thereafter releases a draft that has been revised to reflect the Uniformity Committee s review The revised draft is released to invite initial public comment Step Three The Uniformity Committee may make further revisions to the revised staff draft based on public comments received Uniformity matters of a relatively narrow technical nature not affecting a broad public interest may be referred by the Uniformity Committee directly to Step Five consideration by the Commission s Executive Committee for possible referral to public hearing With regard to uniformity matters drawing broad public interest as partially determined from the comments received following release of the revised staff draft the Uniformity Committee will at the completion of its work generally recommend to the Executive Committee the development of a broad based public participation process to review the then current version of the proposal The Executive Committee then acts on the Uniformity Committee s recommendation to implement the public participation process Step Four The public participation process is developed Specifically a public participation working group is formed that represents the interest of the States affected commerce and the public at large possibly including academics The public participation working group reviews and may revise the then current draft of the proposal The public participation working group develops its version of the draft based upon the draft that was referred to it Further revisions of the draft at this stage are known as public participation working group drafts or recommendations Step Five The Uniformity Committee reviews the work of the public participation working group and makes a recommendation regarding it to the Executive Committee The Executive Committee acts on the recommendation of the Uniformity Committee but is committed to considering public participation working group work regardless of the Uniformity Committee s recommendation The Executive Committee may take whatever action it deems appropriate including terminating the project or referring the proposal back to an earlier step of the process One of the actions the Executive Committee may take would be to refer a specific draft or drafts it has selected for possible adoption as a uniformity recommendation of the Commission to a public hearing Step Six A formal public hearing is conducted pursuant to the requirements of Article VII of the Compact and the Commission Bylaws Following the conclusion of the public hearing the hearing officer or possibly a hearing panel makes a recommendation on the draft The hearing officer panel may recommend Commission adoption of the proposal as referred to it adoption of an amended version of the proposal or non adoption of any proposal Step Seven The Executive Committee reviews the hearing report and recommendation The uniformity recommendation of the hearing officer panel may be passed on to the full Commission amended and passed on to the Commission disapproved entirely or referred back to an earlier step in the process If the Executive Committee chooses to pass any version of the proposal on to the Commission it first authorizes pursuant to MTC Bylaw 7 a polling of the affected Commission Member States to ensure that a majority of the affected States would consider adoption of the draft proposal This survey does not determine if the affected States will adopt the proposal only whether the affected States will consider adoption of the proposal If the majority of the affected Commission Member States so indicate the matter is referred to the full Commission for possible adoption as a uniformity recommendation Step Eight The full Commission votes on adoption of the recommendation In order to be adopted the proposal must receive the affirmative approval of the requisite majorities of the States by number and by population Step Nine Following adoption of the proposal as a Commission uniformity recommendation to the States the proposal is submitted to the States for their consideration All recommendations of the Commission are advisory to the States For a recommendation to become effective in any State that State must affirmatively adopt the proposal With this process in mind the reader may wish to review the list
