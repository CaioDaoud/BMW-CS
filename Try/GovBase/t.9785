What s New What s New with GCN Date and Description 30 Jul 03 Add the sys status html system status link to the beginning of the main page This link replaces the actual placement of the system status messaegs at the beginning of the main page 20 Mar 03 Fixed the same typo on the new system that caused the 2 9armin error on the old system in the INTEGRAL coords In the hectic switchover neccessitated by the IT security folks here at Goddard after the hacker incident the fix done on the old system on 01 Mar 03 did not get moved to the new system now it has 11 Mar 03 The GCN system switch over to a new computer has been completed GCN is up an running See the admin switch complete txt details 01 Mar 03 The integral grbs html INTEGRAL GRBs table now updates in real time Fixed a typo in the INTEGRAL coordinates conversion that produced a 2 9armin error Finished the integral html INTEGRAL web page herein 21 Feb 03 The GCN system will switch over to a new computer on 11 Mar 03 There are no changes for any e mail based site And only the socket sites that are behind a firewall will have to make a change the new machine s IP Number will have to be added tot heir firewall pass through list admin switch over txt Details of the GCN Machine Switch over 14 Feb 03 The GCN system was off line for 23 hours The details are given in admin gcn status txt here 13 Dec 02 The GCN system was off line for 16 hours 00 00 to 15 58 UT Friday 13 Dec 02 The reasosns for this outage are as yet undetermined 19 Oct 02 GCN was off line both Notices Circulars due to a GSFC wide network system upgrade It was off line from 14 11 to 15 07 UT and sluggish from 15 07 to 15 40 UT 12 Oct 02 The Circulars processing demon was modified to send to the successful submittor an email that comes immediately Prior to this change the successfull submitor had to wait until the Circular had been sent to the entire list to find out if he she was successful That old notification is still sent but now you get a message before all the Circulars are distributed This greatly shortens the time you wonder if you were successful Of course the problems with submission notification still comes immediately 03 Sep 02 The INTEGRAL burst location Notices have been added to the GCN system See integral html INTEGRAL details and the gcn3 1529 gcn3 Circ 1529 announcment for the full details 20 Jun 02 The list of strings that are allowed required for gcn circulars html GCN Circular submission has been increased to include AXP anomolous x ray pulsars 15 Apr 02 The IPN is back in business there are 3 spacecraft The GCN IPN Position Notices are being distributed in all forms socket email pager For the gcn3 1372 gcn3 details And for the details of the ipn html GCN IPN Position Notices 08 Apr 02 The HETE Notices emails and socket packets now have several additions the WXM Image X Y Signal Noise the WXM Lightcurve X Y Signal Noise the S C Longitude and the Ecliptic Lon Lat of the burst location See the admin hete adds activated txt details 11 Nov 01 The list of strings that are allowed required for gcn circulars html GCN Circular submission has been increased to include new transient types and mission based strings See admin gcn circ subj list txt the details And a few days after that the HST SDSS and XRB strings were added to the list 16 Aug 01 The konus grbs html KONUS LightCurves page now has Trigger Number and Trigger Type information added to the table These additional fields for each trigger as supplied by human intervention about 2 weeks after the event 06 Aug 01 The HETE Ops team is no longer distributing trigger Notices which are due to x ray burst sources since several days ago This explains the dramatic decrease in the number of GCN HETE Notices However if HETE triggers on a GRB it will still be distributed to GCN and therefore to the world 30 Jul 01 Status of HETE and the various GCN HETE Notices From the HETE perspective gcn3 1084 gcn3 Circular 1084 From the GCN perspective gcn3 1085 gcn3 Circular 1085 28 Jul 01 The filtering of HETE ALERT Notices was changed to allow sites to get them even though they have no position Previously they were blocked because they had no position at least most of the times they had not position about 10 they do but now they will be distributed to those sites requesting the HETE ALERTs even when they have no position information in them 20 Jul 01 The GCN systems back to normal There was another 36 to 48 hour data storm inside Goddard s Build 23 again just like 16 17 July which is now gone But I also changed the socket connection code to reduce the slow down impact of these storms 18 Jul 01 The GCN systems back to normal The Internet connectivity and responsiveness problems reported yesterday have disappeared The connections have been back to normal for over 18 hours which I take to mean that whatever data storm was going on during late 16 to mid 17 Jul 2001 has disappeared 17 Jul 01 The GCN system has been experiencing network connectivity and throughput problems breaks slow downs and blockages since early Monday morning 16 Jul 01 Investigations are underway I will keep you posted This affects the socket connection sites the most 11 Jul 01 Fixed the bug in the GCN s w that caused the no position available in this notice when there was in fact a position available in the HETE Notice 28 Jun 01 The GCN system was off the air for 27 7 hours the admin outage jun01 txt details 20 Jun 01 See admin hete label change txt here for the announcement of the label changes for the HETE email pager Notices 16 Jun 01 See hete episode txt here for an explanation of the difficulties with processing HETE triggers 1554 and 1555 10 Jun 01 The hete grbs html HETE Triggers Information web page is now fully automated Like all the other Mission Instrument GRB web pages this is also updated in realtime within a few seconds after the GCN Notices are distributed 31 May 01 Full automatic operations with HETE have started The process is now completely automated from the on board calculation of the burst position to the transmission to the ground and GCN and on to those sites electing the receive the GCN HETE Notices See the gcn3 1064 gcn3 full announcement Also see the hete html HETE web page in this GCN web site 12 Jan 01 Fixed a mistake in filtering code that caused some sights not to be sent some GCN SAX WFC Notices during the Jun 2000 to Jan 12 2001 six month interval See the admin sax filter fix announce full announcement 11 Jan 01 Fixed a mistake in code that caused the wrong TDJ given in burst notices that occurred in the year 2001 They were off by 1 day It had to do with the year after the leap year mod 400 testing In practice this affected only one IPN POSITION Notice as there were no other burst generated Notices in the first 11 days of this year It did affect the Test Notices and the Imalive packets 16 Dec 00 Changed the maximum socket reconnect retry time interval from 30 minutes to 60 minutes 18 Sep 00 The IPN POSITION burst location Notices have been added to the GCN system See ipn html IPN details and the admin ipn pos announce txt announcment for the full details 26 May 00 CGRO Instruments off loss of BATSE and COMPTEL positions gro gro sci off GCN announcement gro gro press2 NASA HQ press release 25 Jan 00 Added links to PostScript versions of the various published papers on the GCN system See the references html references page 09 Jan 00 There are two new filter available to sites to determine which Notices they get sent They are based on the size of the error box location uncertainty and on the amount of time which has elapsed between the start of the GRB and the time of Notice distribution These two new filters are applied independent of any other filtering criteria already available See the admin err tim filter announce full announcement 03 Jan 00 The GCN system is back on the air after the Y2K and Millennium Madness outages See the gcn3 515 gcn3 full announcement 23 26 Dec 99 and 30 03 Jan 00 Huntsville RBR LOCBURST notices will be off line and there is some Y2K issues for 30 Dec to 03 Jan See the admin eom coverage announce full announcement 18 Dec 99 The bug that caused a delay in delivery minutes to an hour of GCN 471 has been fixed It was due to the inclusion of single or double quotes in the Subject line of the circular submission The new program handles single and double quotes just fine so submitters are free to use them 09 Dec 99 CGRO lost a gyro and had a pointing table problem which caused the loss of 3 2 days of telemetry The details of the outage are explained in this admin outage dec99 txt announcement 04 Dec 99 The BeppoSAX WFC NFI burst location Notices have been fully automated Since late 1997 they have been only semi automated with a human in the loop at the GCN end but now the BeppoSAX and GCN teams have completed the process to be fully automated end to end See admin sax full auto txt announcement for the details See sax html BeppoSAX details and the sax grbs html BeppoSAX Locations Table 13 Nov 99 The graphical form of the BATSE lightcurves have been restored to the GCN system See admin graph lc again txt announcement for the details These lightcurves are available within the batse grbs html BATSE Triggers web page 11 Nov 99 A series of network problems has caused a series of losses of service for the GCN system The admin outages nov99 txt detail of these outages is explained 07 Nov 99 The near grbs html GCN NEAR Notice light curves table is available on the GCN web site This table like the BATSE XTE KONUS etc table pages lists all the NEAR XGRS detections and provides the light curves in Postscript JPEG and numerical text formats There are more details in the admin near tbl announce txt announcement notice 05 Nov 99 A failed internet connection to one of the GCN computers the Channel Controller failed and replaced with a mini hub Total downtime was 20 hours See the admin internet out nov99 txt notice 29 Oct 99 Added the ERROR 2m filter It allows sites to receive burst location Notices that have an location uncertainty less than 2 arcmin radius This filter applies to any source type that site has enabled 10 Oct 99 Created the QUEST filter It is another example of a site custom filter 09 May 99 GRO telemetry lost for 7 5 hours on 09 May 99 For the details see admin gro5 09 txt GRO5 09 TXT 08 May 99 The delay in distributing the BATSE Final socket packets was decreased from 120 sec to 45 sec the best case possible is 35 sec This was done by splitting the socket site processing from the email site processing within the GCN program See the admin final speedup txt full announcement 20 Mar 99 The new SubjHHMM only distribution method was added to the existing list of distribution methods Internet socket e mail pagers and phones This new method puts the RA Dec Time Intensity plus the source of the location BATSE RXTE SAX etc in the Subject line of an e mail that is sent to your pager or cell phone which is only capable of displaying the typically the From line and the Subject line of incoming e mail There is a full description of the subjhhmm fmt html Subject HHMM only Distribution Method Note that the RA Dec are in a different than normal format RA HH MM SS Dec DD MM SS 14 Mar 99 Created the EROS filter It is another example of a site specific custom filter 27 Feb 99 Added the ERROR 1d filter It allows sites to receive burst location Notices that have an location uncertainty less than 1 degree radius This filter applies to any source type that site has enabled 23 Feb 99 The SEU anomaly with BATSE has been fixed gcn3 265 gcn3 GCN Circ 265 Normal operations resumes 22 Feb 99 The BATSE instrument is experiencing anomalous behaviour in its flight swatch which produces MAXBC Notices with bogus C1 and BC rates and therefore bogus locations This is described in gcn3 264 gcn3 GCN Circ 264 Please do not use these notices for any follow up activities 29 Jan 99 The RXTE ASM instrument has set up an automated data processing scheme to search for and localize x ray transients within its FOV Based on archival data searchers there will be about 8 of these transients Novae GRBs and other types per year They will be localized to within 6 arcmin They will be distributed via the GCN as a new Notice type ASM XTRANS GCN sites are encouraged to sign up for this new Notice type 27 Jan 99 CGRO BATSE changed its trigger criteria back to the standard channels 2 3 50 300 keV The first trigger using the new trigger channels was 7356 an accident caused by the flight software change Previously BATSE had been triggering on channels 3 4 nominal energy range greater than 100 keV 07 Jan 99 There was a problem in the date field of the BATSE Notices for Triggers 7293 7300 01 04 Jan 99 This was due to the fact that the front end telemetry processors in PACOR do not know the year They know the the month day hour minute sec and even the microsec but they do not know what year it is To compensate I have the year hardwired into the program I also have code to handle the transition at mindnight 31 Dec but because of another simultaneous problem with the clock generator hardware the transition software got confused and generated odd dates for a few notices It took me a fewe days to notice this new problem and fix the software both the year patch code and the transition code so it will work even better next 31 Dec 29 Oct 98 The konus grbs html GCN KONUS Notice light curves table is available on the GCN web site This table like the BATSE XTE etc table pages lists all the Wind KONUS detections and provides the light curves in Postscript GIF and JPEG formats 21 26 Aug 98 There was an anomoly in the GRO s c pointing which caused a loss of tracking on the desired target Several days were required to figure out the fundamental problem most likely due to a change in the GSE software It should be noted that there was never any problem with the spacecraft itself hardware or onboard software so the life expectancy of GRO is still good Normal observing and data flow from the instruments resumed Wednesday afternnon 26 Aug 98 08 Aug 98 The GCN system was off line from 01 00 until 15 30 UT 08 Aug due to a Goddard network problem 07 Jul 98 Changed the plotting options that make the postscript and GIF versions of the BATSE light curves so that zero is surpressed on the y axis This surpression of the ambient background count rate in BATSE gives emphasis to the burst light curve 14 Jun 98 Added GIF ed version format to the available formats of the light curves for BATSE triggers that have enough counts to calculate a location and type 02 Jun 98 Added SGR to the list of acceptable keyword strings in the Subject line of the gcn circulars html GCN Circulars processing so now the list is GRB grb and SGR 31 May 98 The triggering criteria on BATSE was changed from the usual channels 3 4 to channels 1 2 See gcn3 093 gcn3 GCN Circular 93 for the details 19 May 98 The triggering criteria on BATSE was changed from the usual channels 2 3 to channels 3 4 See gcn3 076 gcn3 GCN Circular 76 for the details 27 Apr 98 The electrical power work for building 23 has been completed The GCN computers were rebooted the internet network connections were re established and the CGRO telemetry processing resumed This is the last of the scheduled outages Not counting these two planned outages in the last month the GCN system has a 98 livetime record 24 Apr 98 Two of the three parts GCN system will be off line unavailable between Friday 19 00 UT 24 Apr 98 and Monday 11 00 UT 27 Apr 98 This is the second of a two part process to replace the main power transformer substation for building 23 Building 23 processes the telemetry for all the near earth spacecraft i e GRO RXTE The GCN Circulars operation part 3 is housed in a different building so it will continue to operate during this interval 10 Apr 98 The gcn circulars html GCN Circulars system was automated The announcement was made via gcn3 054 gcn3 Circular 54 People can now submit and receive GCN Circulars via the automated system However the manual method will be maintained for those individuals who have not yet given the extra information for them to be transferred from the manual list to the automated list 23 Mar 98 The electrical power work for building 23 has been completed The GCN computers were rebooted the internet network connections were re established and the CGRO telemetry processing resumed So the full set of GCN capabilities have been resumed as of 12 35 UT 20 Mar 98 Two of the three parts GCN system will be off line unavailable between Friday 17 00 UT 20 Mar 98 and Monday 11 00 UT 23 Mar 98 The main power substation for building 23 here at GSFC is being replaced due to excessive age Building 23 processes the telemetry for all the near earth spacecraft i e GRO RXTE The GCN Circulars operation part 3 is housed in a different bulding so it will continue to operate during this interval 22 Feb 98 The gcn circulars html GCN Circulars announcement and call for sign up is made This is the culmination of the preliminary announcement the 4th GRB Workshop special interest session discussions and the following months discussions A call for people to sign up to the submission validation and reception list was made IN a couples weeks the transition from the current manual mode of collecting distributing the Circulars ito the automatic mode will be complete 25 Jan 98 The new version of te GCN web site was activated actually much of these work as been incrmentally added over the last 5 months The organization of the main page was changed and many of the top mid detailed level description pages were rewritten to reflect the evolutionary changes from the old BACODINE system to the new GCN system Many format and procedure pages were added The total page count has just about doubled from the original BACODINE version of the web site 01 Jan 98 I forgot to activate the year rollover code which patches the lack of year knowledge for the GRO telemtry processors Hense the GRB DATEs for BATSE triggers 6553 and 6554 had the wrong DOY and YY MM DD This has been fixed and all will be well for another 365 days 18 Dec 97 The LOBURST notices will not be available between 26 29 Dec because of the holidays and Huntsville personnel scheduling All other GCN notice types will continue to be generated and distributed Scott Barthelmy will be unavailable between 22 29 Dec All questions and requests for action should be directed to Paul Butterworth during this period It is a good idea to CC Paul on all your GCN related e mails at all times anyway 17 Dec 97 A shortcut links section for the recent burst was added to the main web page It has all the BATSE location light curve information plus IPN location plus GCN3 optical radio xray follow up information This provides the GRB researcher with a quicker way to access all the GCN information about the hot burst of the week 24 Nov 97 The comptel html GCN COMPTEL GRB Notice type is available for distribution to GCN sites For bright bursts that are in the FOV of the CGRO COMPTEL instrument a location is calculated by the UNH COMPTEL team from the telemetry data which is captured by the GCN system and transferred to UNH about 5 GRBs year This UNH location is sent back to the GCN system for distribution to the GCN sites 04 Oct 97 The final html BATSE Final GRB Coordinates Notice type is available for distribution to GCN sites The Final Notice type is similar to the BATSE Original type except that it is based on an integration of the light curve for up to 32 seconds after the initial BATSE trigger The peak intensity and fluence during that interval are also reported These two items allow the user to access the importance of a burst when deciding about making follow up observations 11 Sep 97 The batse grbs html BATSE GRB Information Table web page is created It contains RA Dec Data Time Intensity Fluence Light Curve information about all BATSE triggers GRBs and non GRB triggers processed by the GCN system It is updated in real time 05 Jul 97 New copies of the sites cfg html sites cfg file can be loaded into the GCN program dynamically while the program is running and it can be done remotely This means I don t have to go from building 2 to 23 to restart the program to get the newly updated config file active 02 Jul 97 The new Subject only distribution method was added to the existing list of distribution methods Internet socket e mail pagers and phones This new method puts the RA Dec position plus the source of the location BATSE RXTE etc in the Subject line of an e mail that is sent to your pager or cell phone which is only capable of displaying the typically the From line and the Subject line of incoming e mail There is a full description of the subject only fmt html Subject only Distribution Method 23 May 97 Two new location notice types were added to the system They are the RXTE PCA GRB location notices and the ALEXIS ultra soft x ray transient locations The RXTE PCA locations are derived for bright GRBs using the LOCBURST Notice locations and also passing through the RXTE scheduling process There is a full description of the rxte pca html RXTE PCA Notices The ALEXIS notices are a variation on the original GRB only theme of BACODINE The ALEXIS spacecraft has 6 telescopes in 3 energy bands 66 77 93 eV and it locates 0 3 unidentified transients every week There is a full description of the alexis html ALEXIS Notices BACODINE changes its name to GCN GRB Coordinates Network to reflect the new broader scope of the types of GRB and ultra soft x ray transient location information now available 02 May 97 A new GRB Location Notice type was added to the system These LOCBURST locations are derived for bright GRBs using the Huntsville Locburst algorithm procedure It is a semi automated process yielding 2 3deg error radii locations in 15 25 minutes time delay There is a full description of the locburst html LOCBURST Notices 25 Feb 97 The BATSE on board flight software triggering criteria were changed back to the normal mode optimized for classical GRBs that is to say channels 2 3 50 300 keV at 5 5 sigma in any of the three times scales 64 256 1024 msec For a list of http www batse msfc nasa gov batse grb catalog current trigger criteria html all the BATSE Trigger Criteria changes 12 Feb 97 Added a discussion on the tm gaps html duration and frequency of gaps in the telemetry from the GRO s c 01 Jan 97 Added gro gcn gro html GRO SSC Status Reports archive page The archive runs from the latest Status Report back to Mar 93 05 Nov 96 The on board trigger criteria for BATSE were changed from the normal 50 300 keV band with a two detector 5 5 sigma threshold to 20 100 keV still 5 5 sigma for the 64 256 msec timescales and 7 0 sigma for the 1024 msec timescale all three scales require two detectors 14 Oct 96 Added ipn gcn ipn html BACO IPN Notice archive page Currently all the BACODINE IPN e mail notices that have been sent are archived here In the future this page will be automatically updated as each new Notice is sent 24 Aug 96 A new distribution method was added to the list It is called the gcn describe html tc6 Short Pager method because it is a shortened message form of the original alpha numeric pager message The original message contained the RA Dec Intensity Time the short form has only the RA Dec This works for those people sites that have pagers with a limited display size 31 Jul 96 The socket demo c socket demo c program now automatically alerts the operator via e mail when the imalive packets have stopped and when they resume 20 Jul 96 Added the capability that a special Test Coordinates packet is sent to the Bradford Telescope socket site at 01 00 01 UT everyday This is different than the normal tech describe html tc21 Test Coordinates packet sending capability to any site that elects to receive them 26 Jun 96 An intermittantly bad multi ether port mux box was replaced This bad mux was causing slow ftp transfers of COMPTEL data and may have caused about 1 in 10 000 Imalive packets to get garbled 25 Jun 96 The on board trigger criteria for BATSE was changed from the normal 50 300keV band with a two detector 5 5 sigma threshold to 100 infinity keV and 4 5 sigma This change was made to greatly enhance the sensitivities to Terrestial Gamma Flashes TGF during a multi wavelength and multi investigator observation campaign on TGFs The sensitivity to classical GRBs is only decreased by about 10 25 Jan 96 The BACODINE software was changed so that it can now retrigger and calculate locations during a BATSE Trigger Readout BATSE could always retrigger during this readout period if the second trigger was brighter than the first trigger but BACODINE was dead during this readout interval Now BACODINE can retrigger as well This is particularly useful during all these triggers from GRO1744 28 Earlier upgrades are listed in the improvements html History Evolution of GCN gcn main
