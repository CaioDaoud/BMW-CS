Video Clip Introduction Kennedy Space Center s launch facilities are located within 1000 feet of the Atlantic Ocean Salt from the ocean combined with the launch vehicles acidic rocket exhaust make corrosion protection a high priority For these reasons KSC maintains state of the art corrosion research and testing capabilities Our Beach Corrosion Test Site has been documented as having higher atmospheric corrosion rates than any other test site in the United States Shuttle Shuttle Launch The Corrosion Technology Testbed is a department of KSC s http www msd ksc nasa gov msd Labs and Testbeds Division and any project involving corrosion may utilize this fully staffed science laboratory as a resource The division includes complete laboratories specializing in metallurgical failure
