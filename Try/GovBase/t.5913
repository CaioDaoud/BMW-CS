extremely limited side on access with 1000 Gigawatts of auxiliary heating adiabatic compression in 1 microsecond oh and the first 1 meter diameter around the device is vaporized after each shot In short that is the diagnostic challenge GENERAL DESCRIPTION Controlled thermonuclear fusion remains one of today s outstanding challenges in fundamental science and applied technology An approach to creating fusion conditions in the laboratory which has the potential for much lower cost than traditional approaches is magnetized target fusion MTF in which a magnetized wall confined plasma is compressed by a magnetically driven imploding liner to fusion conditions If a target plasma is created with sufficient initial temperature density and magnetization which provides thermal insulation it may be compressed to thermonuclear burn conditions with relatively low velocity e g 1 cm m sec magnetically driven liner implosions that have already been achieved using existing electrical pulsed power drivers Plasma thermal particle and radiation transport must be small enough during the formation and implosion process to allow near adiabatic heating Liner and plasma stability during implosion are also critical issues A relatively unexplored approach to fusion which has emerged in the last few years is known as Magnetized Target Fusion MTF MTF is intermediate between magnetic confinement and inertial confinement fusion ICF in time and density scales In contrast to direct hydrodynamic compression of initially ambient temperature fuel e g ICF MTF involves two steps 1 formation of a warm e g 100 eV magnetized e g 100 kG wall confined target plasma prior to implosion 2 subsequent quasi adiabatic compression by an imploding pusher such as a magnetically driven imploding liner In many ways MTF can be considered a marriage between the traditional magnetic and inertial confinement approaches which potentially eliminates some of the pitfalls of either In particular MTF requires simpler smaller and considerably less expensive systems than either magnetic confinement or inertial confinement laser fusion The instabilities which plague traditional approaches to fusion are potentially mitigated in MTF due to wall confinement shockless acceleration and relatively low velocity e g 1 cm m sec of the pusher and low required convergence ratios e g 10 1 Similar to inertial confinement fusion ICF MTF relies on an implosion to compress a DT fuel to ignition conditions Yet also similar to magnetic fusion energy MFE MTF relies on a magnetic field to reduce the thermal diffusion of energy to the walls of a chamber The marriage of these two aspects has several interesting advantages Requirement Feature MFE MTF ICF Starting density 1014 cm 3 1017cm

problem Mix of metal and plasma is bad Rayleigh Taylor limits convergence Plasma Beta 1 1 to 1 in some scenarios the plasma leans on wall By using a magnetic field to reduce the energy losses to the wall the time scale for inertial fusion can be relaxed so that more readily available electrical pulsed power technology rather than an expensive energy inefficient laser can be used as a driver The electrical pulsed power is used to implode a metal liner can around the pre formed target plasma This reduces the convergence ratio requirement to only 10 20x for MTF and such ratios have already been demonstrated in fast liner hydrodynamic experiments For MTF the issues are formation of a long lived 10 microsecond target plasma compatibility of the formation scheme with an implosion geometry symmetry of the implosion prevention of metal plasma mix and actual plasma transport losses to the nearby moving metal wall Diagnosing the small imploding plasma will also be extraordinarily difficult Publications htpd2000 MTF diagnostics paper final pdf Initial tests are proposed on a non imploded target plasma to insure proper understanding and reliability of generation of the pre formed plasma conditions Los Alamos which has long been a leader in the study of fusion physics for nuclear weapons inertial confinement fusion and magnetic fusion has a unique combination of resources to be the world leader in magnetized target fusion Theoretical work at Los Alamos has stimulated worldwide interest in MTF Along with its theoretical and computational modeling capabilities and high energy diagnostics expertise Los Alamos has existing pulsed power facilities which are well suited to this research MTF involves complex liner on plasma experiments which exercise nearly all the theoretical and experimental skills necessary for preservation of nuclear weapons design and testing capabilities in a scientifically exciting and challenging endeavor The FRX L plasma is formed in a 10 5 cm diameter quartz tube with limited side on views through narrow slots in the theta pinch coils and clear end views Later during actual compression shots the only realistic view will be from end on once the plasma is translated into the aluminum metal liner which is roughly the size of a large tomato juice can As the compression proceeds the plasma density will climb to 10 19 cm 13 the plasma temperature to 5 10 keV and the magnetic field to 5 MegaGauss This is a pretty exotic plasma and will require some innovative plasma diagnostics due both to the conditions and the access constraints At the end of the burn phase as the metal continues to collapse to the axis a jet of hot molten metal will probably squirt axially in both directions out the ends of the experiment making survivability of end on diagnostics also questionable Present diagnostics include external B dot probes excluded flux loops H alpha monitors gated intensified visible spectroscopy 0 25 m spectrometer with PAR 1256 ISIT array 3 39 micron laser interferometry end on fast visible framing camera up to 15 frames at 1 million fps on polaroid film Future diagnostics will include a 20 Joule ruby laser system for Thomson scattering All of these apply to the pre compression target plasma and will be adapted for the plasma translation tests into a fake metal liner where interactions with the metal wall may also be observed through tracer spectroscopy The diagnostics during the implosion phase will be much more limited but intrinsically more interesting since this kind of performance conditions have never been available to be studied before An example diagnostic that could work and provide interesting information n T B would be far forward laser scattering in the microsecond before the end effects close off the view of the plasma Of course neutron diagnostics will be key for the burn phase and don t require optical access Soft x ray measurements may also be more interesting than visible ranges since the Stark Zeeman Paschen broadening is less at short wavelengths An artist s conception of a Field Reversed Configuration target plasma with integrated liner assembly is shown in the
