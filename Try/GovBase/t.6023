Sites What is HDF Hierarchical Data Format HDF is a data file format designed by the National Center for Supercomputing Applications NCSA to assist users in the storage and manipulation of scientific data across diverse operating systems and machines NCSA developed a library of callable routines and a set of utility programs and tools for creating and using HDF files HDF supports a variety of data types scientific data arrays tables and text annotations as well as several types of raster images and their associated color palettes There are two distinct varieties of HDF known as HDF version 4 and earlier and the newer HDF5 These are described in more detail at the http hdf ncsa uiuc edu NCSA HDF web site Some of the features of HDF are HDF makes it possible for programs to obtain information about the data from the data file itself rather than from another source HDF standardizes the format and descriptions of many types of commonly used data sets such as raster images and scientific data HDF is a platform independent file format It can be used on many different computers regardless of the operating system that machine is running New data models may be added to HDF by either the development team or HDF users HDF files are also self describing For each data object in an HDF file there are predefined tags that identify such information as the type of data the amount of data its dimensions and its location in the file The self describing capability of HDF files has important implications for processing scientific data It makes it possible to fully understand the structure and contents of a file just from the information stored in the file itself A program that has been written to interpret certain tag types can scan a file containing those tag types and process the corresponding data Self description also means that many types of data can be bundled in an HDF file For example it is possible to accommodate symbolic numerical and graphical data in one HDF file For more information on what HDF can do visit the http hdf ncsa uiuc edu HDF FAQ html HDF FAQ Or view the slide presentation http hdf ncsa uiuc edu training hdfintro mapint97 index htm An Introduction to HDF Command Line Utilities HDF command line utilities are applications that allow you to perform common operations on and manipulations of HDF files These utilities can be executed at the command level like UNIX commands The following are four examples of useful HDF command line utilities hdfls Allows you to list basic information about an HDF file such as tags and reference numbers and the length of each data element hdfed Allows you to examine the data file itself and to move data between two HDF files r8tohdf One of three that allows you to manipulate HDF files that contain raster image sets This utility converts one or more raw images to HDF 8 bit raster image set format and writes them to a file fptohdf Converts floating point arrays from either text files or HDF scientific data sets to either HDF 8 bit raster image sets RIS8 or HDF scientific data sets SDS or both and stores the results in an HDF file The image can be scaled about a mean value that is
