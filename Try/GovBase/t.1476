of Hurricane Mitch accurate data expert analyses and technical assistance are needed to plan and implement the massive reconstruction efforts facing Central America Critical to these efforts in each Mitch affected country is the development of a comprehensive centralized and accessible hydrologic database one that includes both historic and current hydrologic streamflow and precipitation data To address this need the USGS will work with counterpart agencies in each country to compile available historic hydrologic data In Honduras the USGS and its counterparts will develop a centralized interactive hydrologic database utilizing the standard hydrologic database system of the USGS In other Mitch affected countries the USGS will help assess existing hydrologic databases and will implement some or all components of the USGS database system In El Salvador Honduras and Guatemala there will also be an emphasis on regional cooperation and exchange of hydrologic data for the R o Lempa Basin a watershed shared by these three countries Objectives Establish a centralized comprehensive hydrologic database in Honduras Implement components of the USGS database system in Nicaragua El Salvador and Guatemala to improve and standardize hydrologic databases in those countries Develop a regional component for hydrologic data from the R o Lempa Basin coordinate data exchange and database linkages among the countries that share the R o Lempa to enhance data access by scientists engineers and resource managers Upgrade computer hardware software as needed in each country and standardize hydrologic data collection and management Install PC based satellite downlinks for direct access by counterpart agencies to hydrologic data transmitted by USGS streamflow gaging stations in Nicaragua El Salvador and Guatemala Train counterpart personnel in each country Approach The coordination of existing data and the collection of new data in a consistent standardized fashion are critical to the creation of centralized hydrologic databases in this region Only Nicaragua through its earth science agency Instituto Nicarag ense de Estudios Territoriales INETER currently maintains a centralized hydrologic database The situation in neighboring countries is quite different In Honduras for example four agencies the Secretar a de Recursos Naturales y Ambiente SERNA the Empresa Nacional de Energ a El ctrica ENEE the Servicio Aut nomo Nacional de Acueductos y Alcantarillados SANAA and the Comisi n Ejecutiva Valle de Sula CEVS have been collecting hydrologic data from more than 70 streamflow gaging stations and 140 precipitation gages Each of these agencies has used different methods for data collection and quality assurance and stored the data it has collected in its own offices In order to accurately apply and statistically manipulate hydrologic data to determine discharge values both historic and current hydrologic information gathered using standardized methodologies must be available in a centralized database in each Mitch affected country To this end the USGS is working with counterpart agencies in each country to compile all available historic hydrologic data The USGS is installing powerful computer systems to house each country s hydrologic data at a central site Selected components of the USGS database system National Water Information System NWIS http water usgs gov pubs FS FS 027 98 index html http water usgs gov pubs FS FS 027 98 index html are being implemented in each country As of November 30 2000 computer workstations have been installed in Nicaragua and El Salvador System installations are planned for Honduras and Guatemala in 2001 Host country counterparts are being trained to input analyze and store all hydrologic data using standardized methods that will encourage regional compatibility Formal training was conducted at the USGS District office in Puerto Rico in Nicaragua and in El Salvador during 2000 To the extent possible counterpart from each country are invited to each course this approach will strengthen data compatibility throughout the region and will promote comaraderie among professionals and technicians from each country Hydrologic information working groups have been formed to ensure standardized techniques for each country s database to quality assure the stored information and to ensure that the data are readily available to agencies Training courses conducted by USGS personnel are focused on utilizing hydrologic information for engineers and water resource managers engaged in infrastructure design reservoir management and related activities Cooperating Agencies Honduras SERNA ENEE CEVS SANAA Universidad Tecnol gica Centroamericana UNITEC COPECO Servicio Meteorol gico

database in Honduras Database will house all available hydrologic data for the country with public access by all interested parties Technical assessments with written reports and recommendations of hydrologic databases in Nicaragua El Salvador Guatemala Costa Rica Technical assessments with written reports and recommendations of database capabilities and needs for at least 15 Mitch affected municipalities in each of Nicaragua El Salvador and Guatemala Installation of PC based emergency warning systems for a selected sub group of these municipalities in each country Training of personnel of counterpart agencies in database design management and quality control Summary report of hydrologic database capabilities and inventory of data for each of the partner countries Development of Internet site linking databases throughout the region and a service of available data via the World Wide Web Detailed focus on data sharing resource management and early warning capabilities in the Rio Lempa Basin Deliverables A centralized comprehensive publicly accessible hydrologic database in Honduras Assessments of hydrologic databases in Nicaragua El Salvador Guatemala and implementation
