USGS Northridge Earthquake 10th Anniversary USGS logo Caltech the USGS and the Earthquake Country Alliance present Caltech logo Northridge Earthquake 10th Anniversary January 17 2004 9 AM to 3 30 PM At Beckman Auditorium on the Caltech Campus Lectures Movies Displays and Activities about Earthquakes Just 10 years ago Los Angeles was shaken awake by the Northridge earthquake and seismologists at the USGS and Caltech are still shaking things up with ground breaking research and state of the art technology to better understand earthquakes and their effects Come and see what we have learned from the past and how we are planning for the future speakers html Speakers exhibitors html Exhibitors resources html Activities and Resources http www caltech edu map Caltech Campus Map info nr10 flyer pdf Download Flyer PDF The Facts Time Location Depth Magnitude Fault Rupture Area Economic Loss Deaths Displaced from Homes January 17 1994 4 31 PST 34 12 80 N 118 32 22 W 20 miles WNW of Los Angeles 1 mile SSW of Northridge 18 4 km Mw6 7 Northridge Thrust also known as Pico Thrust 300 km2 20 40 billion 57 people 20 000 people At 4 30 am on January 17 1994 residents of the greater Los Angeles area were rudely awakened by the strong shaking of the Northridge earthquake This was the first earthquake to strike directly under an urban area of the United States since the 1933 Long Beach earthquake The earthquake occurred on a blind thrust fault and produced the strongest ground motions ever instrumentally recorded in an urban setting in North America Damage was wide spread sections of major freeways collapsed parking structures and office buildings collapsed and numerous apartment buildings suffered irreparable damage Damage to wood frame apartment houses was very widespread in the San Fernando Valley and Santa Monica areas especially to structures with soft first floor or lower level parking garages The high accelerations both vertical and horizontal lifted structures off of their foundations and or shifted walls laterally Despite the losses gains made through earthquake hazard mitigation efforts of the last two decades were obvious Retrofits of masonry building helped reduce the loss of life hospitals suffered less structural damage than in 1971 San Fernando earthquake and emergency response was exemplary The Northridge earthquake proved that preparing for earthquakes can greatly reduce the risk The earthquake brought home several important lessons Thrust faults concealed below Los Angeles present a threat to the region approaching that posed by the San Andreas fault When earthquakes occur directly beneath a city it will be subjected to ground motions with peak accelerations approaching the force of gravity exceeding the levels of shaking anticipated by building codes Systems of concealed faults under the Los Angeles area are more complex than previously thought The significant fracturing of welds in steel frame buildings was unexpected because of the ductility of steel Understanding the cause and correcting the problem will be essential to continue building in earthquake prone regions http www scecdc scec org SCEC Data Center Northridge 10th Anniversary Commemorative Activities http www earthquakecountry info alliance Earthquake Country Alliance Links to more information about the Northridge Earthquake http geohazards cr usgs gov northridge norpub1 htm USGS Response to an Urban Earthquake http pasadena wr usgs gov north 20 Northridge Earthquake Research Products http www scecdc scec org slidesho html Northridge Description and Photos http autoinfo smartlink net quake quake htm Northridge Photo Album http www eqe com publications northridge northridge html EQE Northridge Summary report http www psc edu research graphics gallery earthquake html Simulation of Northridge Earthquake Aftershock Links to Earthquake Information http earthquake usgs gov USGS Earthquake Hazards Program http earthquake usgs gov 4kids USGS Earthquake Earthquakes for Kids Grown ups http www caltech era org Caltech Earthquake Research Affiliates ERA http www gps caltech edu seismo Caltech Seismology Lab http www scec org Southern California Earthquake Center
