minutes after launch and is now in an elliptical orbit ranging from 1 000 kilometers to 45 871 kilometers above Earth The skies cleared then our hearts lifted with the IMAGE spacecraft on time on budget on the start of a new era in space physics at the Earth said onlooker Dennis Gallagher a plasma physicist from NASA s Marshall Space Flight Center who attended the launch along with other members of the IMAGE science team Right Dennis Gallagher NASA MSFC snapped this picture of IMAGE soaring into space aboard a Delta rocket on March 25 2000 The spacecraft appears to be healthy with all systems performing nominally said IMAGE project manager Frank Volpe at NASA s Goddard Space Flight Center Greenbelt Md We are looking forward to a great science mission news subscribe htm subscription

area of space around our planet that is controlled by Earth s magnetic field Scientists expect the mission to revolutionize their understanding of the magnetosphere and to greatly improve space

radio plasma imager are deployed explained Gallagher They re 500 meters tip to tip As we reel them out we have to continuously respin the spacecraft because it s spin stabilized After the 40 day setup period IMAGE will begin using its trio of neutral atom imagers a far ultraviolet imaging system an extreme ultraviolet imager and a radio plasma imager to make movies of the magnetosphere This unique approach will allow scientists to view for the first time the big picture rather than capturing limited local measurements at far flung points in space http image gsfc nasa gov movie see caption Stay
