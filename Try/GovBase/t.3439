temperatureoutlook 101603b jpg NOAA image of forecast winter temperatures for the USA Oct 16 2003 Temperatures in Alaska the far West Southwest and Southern Plains are expected to be above normal for the 2003 04 winter For other parts of the nation the winter will bring equal chances of above below or near normal temperatures according to http www noaa gov NOAA forecasters The agency today released its official winter outlook which unlike most of the last six winters is not expected to be influenced by a strong http www cpc ncep noaa gov products analysis monitoring enso advisory El Ni o or http www cpc ncep noaa gov products analysis monitoring ensocycle nawinter html La Ni a Though weak El Ni o conditions are possible by the end of November NOAA forecasters expect a minimal impact on the United States Click NOAA image for larger view of forecast winter temperatures for the USA images temperatureoutlook 101603 jpg Click here for high resolution version which is a large file Please credit NOAA The forecast also projected the multi year drought in the West will likely continue with limited improvement and lingering water shortages The winter outlook will be updated on Nov 20 images precipitationoutlook 101603b jpg NOAA image of forecast winter precipitation for the USA Reasons for Uncertainty Without a strong El Ni o or La Ni a signal as a guide there is more uncertainty in our forecast but we do expect winter to bring its typical weather variability said John Jones Jr deputy director of the NOAA National Weather Service Click NOAA image for larger view of

where a dominant climate feature in the Pacific Ocean is missing rely on historical trends of temperature and precipitation averages as well as dynamical and statistical models images droughtoutlook 101603b jpg NOAA image of drought outlook for the USA Jones said researchers are studying other climatic factors that influence NOAA s seasonal outlooks but these influences aren t yet routinely predictable on seasonal time scales As examples he cited several factors that need further study and pose significant challenges to the climate forecast including tropical ocean temperatures in the western Pacific and Indian Oceans atmospheric circulation patterns in the Arctic and North Atlantic snow cover in the high latitudes during the late fall and U S soil moisture conditions Click NOAA

collaborating with the research community for improving data management and collection operations and fine tuning the oceanic and atmospheric models that run on the supercomputers Jones said Forecast uncertainty in low climate signal years like this can be reduced but it will take more research and more resources to do that Jones said the conditions this year also highlight the value of collecting and sharing data on a global scale NOAA is moving aggressively on that front with action that came out of the Administration sponsored Earth Observation Summit that was held this summer in Washington D C At that session more than 34 nations plus the European Commission launched the development of a 10 year implementation plan to arrange a system of integrated space borne airborne and in situ observations to help understand and address global environmental and economic concerns NOAA NASA and the U S State Department hosted the summit Winter 2003 04 Outlook While ocean temperatures in the tropical Pacific are warmer than long term averages and may even reach the level of a weak El Ni o by late November El Ni o is not expected to exert a major influence on U S climate this winter said Ed O Lenic senior meteorologist and lead forecaster at the http www cpc ncep noaa gov NOAA Climate Prediction Center which is part of the http www nws noaa gov NOAA National Weather Service Our forecast tools imply large uncertainty in the northern and eastern U S while a clearer picture emerges elsewhere Based on those tools NOAA forecasters expect In Alaska the far West the Southwest and the southern Plains temperatures will likely be warmer than the long term averages Elsewhere there are equal chances of above below and normal temperatures The majority of the nation will have equal chances of above below and normal precipitation with the exception of Texas Oklahoma and areas of western Louisiana southwestern Arkansas and eastern New Mexico where above normal amounts are likely NOAA forecasters also expect existing multi year drought conditions in much of the West except California and parts of the Central Plains to continue with improvement in complex patterns predominantly in the north central plains and parts of the far west In most other areas drought will likely persist or improve with many lingering long term water shortages The NOAA National Weather Service is the
