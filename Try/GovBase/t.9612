Research indicates that women can become addicted quickly to certain drugs such as crack cocaine even after casual or experimental use Therefore by the time a woman enters treatment she may be severely addicted making treatment more difficult This is also true when a woman becomes dependent on prescription painkillers What happens during treatment Treatment should include an evaluation of other serious health problems associated with drug abuse For women some of these problems are Poor nutrition and below average weight Low self esteem Depression Physical abuse If pregnant pre term labor or early delivery Serious medical and infectious diseases e g increased blood pressure and heart rate STDs HIV AIDS Why do some women refuse to seek treatment for drug abuse Many drug using women do not seek treatment because they are afraid they worry they won t be able to keep or care for their children they fear reprisal from their spouses or boyfriends and they fear punishment from authorities in the community Many women report that their drug using male sex partners initiated them into drug abuse and then sabotaged their efforts to quit using drugs Is there a connection between drug abuse and HIV AIDS Yes AIDS is now the fourth leading cause of death among women of childbearing age in the United States It is the leading cause of death for African American women between the ages of 25 and 44 Because HIV AIDS often is transmitted through shared needles or syringes women who inject drugs or share drug paraphernalia are at an increased risk of getting the deadly disease In addition under the influence of illicit drugs and alcohol a woman s judgement can become impaired As a result women may engage in unprotected sex which also increases their risk for contracting or transmitting HIV AIDS Among the 1 5 million injecting drug users 14 are known to be infected with HIV What treatment is available for women Research indicates that more than 4 million women need treatment for drug abuse Unfortunately there are some significant reasons as stated above why many women do not seek help Research shows that women receive the most benefit from drug treatment programs that provide comprehensive services for meeting their basic needs including access to Food clothing and shelter Transportation Job counseling and training Legal assistance Literacy training and educational opportunities Parenting training Family therapy Medical care Child care Social services Social support Psychological assessment and mental health care Assertiveness training Family planning services Traditional male oriented drug treatment programs may not be appropriate for women because those programs may not provide these services Research also indicates that for women in particular treatment is more successful when they stay in regular touch with their treatment provider When a woman lapses during the treatment and recovery process it is important that they get the support of the community and encouragement of those closest to them After completing a drug treatment program women also need services to assist them in sustaining their recovery and in rejoining the community Where can I call if I have questions related to drug abuse A toll free hotline is available to provide free confidential answers to women seeking help for themselves or for someone they care
