The ORNL DAAC offers Earth science data for global change research and Earth systems studies Sponsored by NASA the archive includes field data remote sensing data imagery and the results of ecosystems modeling The ORNL DAAC archives regional and global data about climate environmental processes nutrient cycles stream and river discharge soil properties canopy chemistry net primary productivity land use change and vegetation Such data are vital to understanding and predicting how Earth systems function The data can be used to validate remotely sensed information as well as to improve and validate
