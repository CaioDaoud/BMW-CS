and innovation led to the development of many useful and helpful products A practical man of humble beginnings Morgan devoted his life to creating things that made the lives of other people safer and more convenient Among his inventions was an early traffic signal that greatly improved safety on America s streets and roadways Indeed Morgan s technology was the basis for modern traffic signal systems and was an early example of what we know today as Intelligent Transportation Systems The Inventor s Early Life The son of former slaves Garrett A Morgan was born in Paris Kentucky on March 4 1877 His early childhood was spent attending school and working on the family farm with his brothers and sisters While still a teenager he left Kentucky and moved north to Cincinnati Ohio in search of opportunity Although Morgan s formal education never took him beyond elementary school he hired a tutor while living in Cincinnati and continued his studies in English grammar In 1895 Morgan moved to Cleveland Ohio where he went to work as a sewing machine repair man for a clothing manufacturer News of his proficiency for fixing things and experimenting traveled fast and led to numerous job offers from various manufacturing firms in the Cleveland area In 1907 Morgan opened his own sewing equipment and repair shop It was the first of several businesses he would establish In 1909 he expanded the enterprise to include a tailoring shop that employed 32 employees The new company turned out coats suits and dresses all sewn with equipment that Morgan himself had made In 1920 Morgan moved into the newspaper business when he established the Cleveland Call As the years went on he became a prosperous and widely respected business man and he was able to purchase a home and an automobile Indeed it was Morgan s experience while driving along the streets of Cleveland that led to the invention of the nation s first patented traffic signal The Garrett Morgan Traffic Signal The first American made automobiles were introduced to U S consumers shortly before the turn of the century The Ford Motor Company was founded in 1903 and with it American consumers began to discover the adventures of the open road In the early years of the 20th century it was not uncommon for bicycles animal powered wagons and new gasoline powered motor vehicles to share the same streets and roadways with pedestrians Accidents were frequent After witnessing a collision between an automobile and a horse drawn carriage Morgan was convinced that something should be done to improve traffic safety While other inventors are reported to have experimented with and even marketed traffic signals Garrett A Morgan was the first to apply for and acquire a U S patent for such a device The patent was granted on November 20 1923 Morgan later had the technology patented in Great Britain and Canada as well The Morgan traffic signal was a T shaped pole unit that featured three positions Stop Go and an all directional stop position This third position halted traffic in all directions to allow pedestrians to cross streets more safely Morgan s traffic management device was used throughout North America until it was replaced by the red yellow and green light traffic signals currently used around the world The inventor sold the rights to his traffic signal to the General Electric Corporation for 40 000 Shortly before his death in 1963 Morgan was awarded a citation for his traffic signal by the United States Government Other Morgan Inventions Garrett Morgan was constantly experimenting to develop new concepts Though the traffic signal came at the height of his career and became one of his most renowned inventions it was just one of several innovations he developed manufactured and sold over the years Morgan invented a zig zag stitching attachment for manually operated sewing machine He also founded a company that made personal grooming products such as hair dying ointments and the curved tooth pressing comb Another Significant Contribution to Public Safety On July 25 1916 Morgan made national news for using a gas mask he had invented to rescue several men trapped during an explosion in an underground tunnel beneath Lake Erie After the rescue Morgan s company received requests from fire departments around the country who wished to purchase the new masks The Morgan gas mask was later refined for use by U S Army during World War I In 1921 Morgan was awarded a patent for a Safety Hood and Smoke Protector Two years later a refined model of his early gas mask won a gold medal at the International Exposition of Sanitation and Safety and another gold medal from the International Association of Fire Chiefs As word of Morgan s life saving inventions spread across North America and England demand for these products grew He was frequently invited to conventions and public exhibitions to demonstrate how his inventions worked Garrett A Morgan died on August 27 1963 at the age of 86 His life was long and full and his creative energies have given us a marvelous and lasting legacy top Return to the top k5 gamk5 htm K 5 68 68 html 6 8 912 912 html 9 12 cc index html CC
