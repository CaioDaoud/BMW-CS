understanding the distribution of potentially hazardous substances in coal and coal combustion products Case studies in areas with documented environmental health effects such as Guizhou Province China and the Balkans have concentrated on determining the sources of these effects and on developing simple measures that can be taken by the affected populations to minimize their exposure to the hazards identified HUMAN HEALTH ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS PRODUCTS AND PUBLICATIONS WRITTEN OR CREATED PRIMARILY BY EERT AUTHORS YEARS 1995 TODAY impacts new products htm New USGS Health Impacts Products

USGS Health Impacts Abstracts USGS Abstracts are condensed but informative summaries of presentations made at meetings of scientific and professional organizations Typically abstracts summarize the principal conclusions of an author s current work but contain little supporting data impacts bulletins circulars htm USGS Health Impacts Bulletins USGS Health Impacts Circulars USGS Bulletins contain significant data and interpretations that are of lasting scientific interest but are generally more limited in scope or geographic coverage than professional papers Bulletins include the results of resource studies and of geologic and topographic investigations as well as collections of short papers related to a specific topic USGS Circulars present technical or non technical information of wide popular interest in a format designed for distribution at no cost to the public Circulars are published to disseminate administrative information or important scientific information of an ephemeral

openfile reports htm USGS Health Impacts Open File Reports USGS Open File Reports include unpublished manuscript reports maps field notes data compilations and other materials that are made available for public consultation at depositories They are a nonpermanent form of publication that may be cited in other publications as sources of information impacts pro papers htm USGS Health Impacts Professional Papers USGS Professional Papers are mainly comprehensive scientific reports of wide and lasting interest and importance to professional scientists and engineers Included are reports on the results of resource studies and of topographic hydrologic and geologic investigations They also include collections of related papers addressing different aspects of a single scientific topic
