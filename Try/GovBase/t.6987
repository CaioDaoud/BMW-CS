Board of Corrections Seal California Board of Corrections My CA This Site STC Frequently Asked Questions Pertaining to STC FY 2003 2004 The current state 2003 2004 budget that was adopted by the Legislature eliminated state subvention funding from fines and penalties in support of local corrections and probation departments This list of Frequently Asked Questions is designed to keep you informed with regard to adjustments in the program administration This page will be continually updated so please check in often If you have specific questions please contact your Field Representative by telephone or email Phone numbers and addresses are located on the directories directories boc directory htm BOC Directory Subvention Funding and Administration When will funding end State subvention funding associated with the STC Program ended on June 30 2003 Agency close out of accounts for the 2002 2003 training year will be completed no later than October 15 2003 Have all of the 2002 2003 subvention funds been disbursed Yes Requests for 4th Quarter funding has been sent to the State Controller for payment What happens to any 2002 2003 funds reported as unexpended on my 2002 2003 Annual Financial Statement AFS If you have unexpended funds for 2002 2003 please mail a check for that amount to STC along with the signature page of your AFS The check should be made payable to the Corrections Training Fund Please contact your Field Representative if you have questions regarding this matter How will the Annual Training Plan change with the loss of funding Most references to STC funding will be either stricken or default to zero in terms of the funding formula allocation disbursement etc Language in the Agency Assurance Statement will be modified to reflect the absence of funding Will Quarterly Reports still be required and if so how will they change Quarterly reports will become a report on quarterly training activity courses completed Data concerning local agency expenditures will not be required on a quarterly basis At the end of the current fiscal year 2003 2004 will an Annual Financial Statement be required Annual Financial Statements for the last fiscal year with funding 2002 2003 should be filed using the existing format At this point it is uncertain what the 2003 2004 AFS will look like STC is exploring whether or not it would be useful as a strategy to get local assistance funds reinstated in the future to track expenditure of local dollars for training perhaps on a voluntary basis Further direction will be provided on this issue as soon as a decision is made Training Delivery System Course Certifications Will the BOC continue to provide technical support for the selection and training of local correctional personnel Yes The BOC has a long history and strong commitment to improving the quality of local corrections personnel in California Over the past twenty three years in partnership with local corrections agencies we have developed an enduring selection and training delivery system that has worked consistently well through out the years Should I continue to request STC certification for my training courses Yes STC will continue in its role of offering 3rd party oversight of local training programs STC certification involves a review for job relevancy appropriateness of training content and methodology and also instructor expertise It will continue to be in the best interests of local agencies and other training providers to obtain STC certification for courses Will the Regular Request for Course Certification process change When seeking request for course certification providers will be given the option of whether or not they wish to have an STC approved course budget and tuition rate effective as soon as we are able to modify the on line interface If a provider opts for STC approved budget and tuition consumers local departments can rest assured that the course is cost effective and that all calculations for course costs and tuition are consistent with existing allowances for various line items Under this option training providers voluntarily agree to adhere to all STC policy and procedures concerning course costs and tuition rates effective as soon as we are able to modify the on line interface Advance filing time for regular request for course certification will be reduced from 30 calendar days to 20 calendar days for routine annual training courses Complex multi track annual training courses as well as Core courses will still need to be filed 60 days in advance of the first scheduled presentation date effective immediately If a provider does not wish to have STC review the course budget and tuition for cost effectiveness the STC approved budget and tuition rate will appear as N A in all STC publications e g course record course profile course catalog etc What this means is that the free market will prevail and that training providers and local corrections agencies may negotiate course costs as they see fit effective as soon as we are able to modify the on line interface Will the Request for Special Certification process change When seeking special certification from STC for the time being local departments should enter the course tuition as 0 in all cases since no local assistance funds are available effective immediately Since no State funds will be used to pay course tuition information concerning the proposed trainee s specialized assignment and unique training need will no longer be required effective immediately The reference to tuition will likely be removed from the Special Certification request entirely in the near future effective as soon as we can modify the on line interface Local departments may file requests for special certification after the course delivery as long as they file it prior to June 30 of the fiscal year during which the training occurred However local departments that choose to exercise this option need to be mindful that specific criterion must be present for course certification If these criterion are not adequately the request for certification may be denied Therefore for planning purposes the best practice will continue to be requesting course certification prior to course delivery effective immediately Statutory and Regulatory Requirements Are the operators of local adult and juvenile corrections facilities still required to train their staff Yes There is widespread agreement that the need to appropriately select and train staff continues even in the absence of local assistance funding from the State This requirement is specified in various statutes and the courts have generally taken the position that selection and training of correctional personnel must be consistent with both the law and the community standard The community standard for corrections consists of a 23 year practice of ensuring that local staff receive core and annual training consistent with STC regulations Although the available resources to accomplish this task have been significantly curtailed in the current fiscal year STC will continue to work closely with local agencies to accomplish this difficult yet crucial task Will the BOC continue to inspect local corrections agencies for compliance with regulations pertinent to the selection and training of staff Yes Laws regulations and court decisions clearly require correctional staff be properly selected and trained in order to maintain safe correctional facilities that meet constitutional minimums Regular inspections of all local correctional facilities will be conducted as required by law Miscellaneous Are other modifications to the STC Program being considered BOC recently convened an Executive Steering Committee ESC comprised of top level local administrators to explore how STC might modify policies procedures and use resources differently in the future to help mitigate the loss of funding Employing workgroups comprised of local training managers the ESC identified a number of concrete areas worthy of further investigation feasibility studies and action planning The ESC presented its recommendations to the Board of Corrections at the October 2003 meeting and the Board directed staff to further explore and begin action planning where possible in a number of areas including Developing a streamlined mechanism by which STC could cross certify or otherwise recognize courses that are already POST certified STC credit for well defined well documented structured On the Job training programs Currently no journey level trainee may receive more than one half of his her annual training requirement with any combination of Intensified Format Training IFT or Work Related Training WRE credit A lift on this cap for either IFT and or WRE is currently being considered STC credit for correspondence courses that meet criteria identified by STC Developing a streamlined mechanism by which STC could cross certify or otherwise recognize designated courses that are delivered by trusted partners outside of California e g NIC AJA FBI etc Because these items all involve substantive changes to STC policies and procedures STC staff recommendations will need to be formally considered at future BOC meetings before any of these items could be implemented PageTop Back to
