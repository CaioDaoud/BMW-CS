Requirements http www section508 gov Section 508 requires that when Federal agencies develop procure maintain or use electronic and information technology EIT Federal employees with disabilities have comparable access to and use of information and data as Federal employees who have no disabilities unless an undue burden would be imposed on the agency Section 508 also requires that individuals with disabilities who are members of the public seeking information or services from a Federal agency have comparable access to and use of information and data as the public without disabilities unless an undue burden would be imposed on the agency Although Federal agencies have an explicit statutory obligation to make all EIT that they develop maintain or use compliant with Section 508 the current emphasis is on newly procured EIT because it is the category that is explicitly enforceable by legal action Procurement awards made on or after June 25 2001 are subject to Section 508 see http www
