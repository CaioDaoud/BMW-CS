DOQs can be viewed with most GIS software packages such as ARC INFO ArcView MicroStation SmallWorld Intergraph GeoMedia Idrisi etc The USGS provides two free downloadable software tools Dem3d and Dlgv32 viewers for viewing digital data For more information and downloads of the viewers please visit the viewers html DEM and DLG Viewer page Question Where do the data come from Answer The data available on this site are provided by agencies and organizations partnering in the Lake Tahoe Initiative For example the USGS has provided an array of GIS data products to the public free of charge because of the Presidential Commitments Question What is a projection Answer A map projection is an attempt to portray the curved 3 dimensional surface of the Earth on the flat 2 dimensional surface of a map One method to perform this task is to physically project the surface of the earth onto a flat surface Map projections are usually performed using mathematical formulas There is no perfect way to project a sphere onto a plane so some geographic distortion will occur when choosing any projection At least one of the following geographic properties is lost when the projection is made Shape Shape refers to the physical dimensionality of an object so that at any point the scale is the same in every direction If the shape of an area is preserved its size will be distorted If the angle at which the intersection occurs is other than a right angle 90 degrees then angles are not preserved Map projections that preserve angle or shape are called conformal or orthomorphic Area Area refers to the property of maps to accurately represent the relative size of regions No projection can preserve both shape and area Map projections that preserve area are called equal area or equivalent Distance Distance refers to the physical distance between points on the map The preservation of distances is the same as the preservation of scale Distances measured between any two points on a map are a constant fraction of the distances if they were measured on the ground Map projections that preserve distance are called equidistant Direction Direction refers to a map projection s ability to represent the shortest distance between any two points as a straight line This path is also called a great circle This projection is limited in the fact that it can only correctly show directions or angles to all other points on the map with respect to a central point Map projections that preserve direction are called azimuthal The trick is to pick the projection that causes the least distortion or emphasizes the desired properties for your area of interest Each map projection has specific properties that make it useful for specific purposes For more information on projections please see

what projection Answer All digital data for Lake Tahoe Data Clearinghouse are in UTM NAD27 zone 10 The original data are a mix of two projections Universal Transverse Mercator UTM zone 11 runs between 114W and 120W longitude and UTM zone 10 runs between 120W and 126W longitude Because the project needed a standard projection UTM zone 10 was chosen The maps east of 120 degrees longitude are usually mapped in UTM zone 11 and those west of 120 degrees are mapped in UTM zone 10 There is no possible way to combine these different projections in a GIS Therefore maps in zone 11 have been reprojected into zone 10 An effort has been made to provide a copy of reprojected files in their original zone of origin The maps reprojected into zone 10 are not a standard USGS products and only available through this web site Question How do I change projections Answer Many full featured GIS packages will provide the capability to reproject data However each software package performs this operation differently and the commands are often complex Because of the difficulty in reprojecting data refer to your GIS s manual or use the UTM NAD27 zone 10 data provided on this website Blue Bar Questions from users Question How can I view the DEM elevation information in ArcView Answer The DEMs are raster data which can only be queried in ArcView with the use of the Spatial Analyst extension The hypsography DLGs contain the base information from which the DEMs were created The DLGs are vector data easily downloaded from this site DLG html http tahoe usgs gov DLG html and read into ArcView Question Is there similar data on other areas Answer Many clearinghouse websites exist The gateway to many clearinghouses on the web is footer image http 130 11 52 178 Geospatial Data Clearinghouse

do I view data on the Lake Tahoe Data Clearinghouse presented in MrSID format Answer MrSID is a compression technology created by footer image http www lizardtech com LizardTech that can compress very large files with very little data loss The USGS is working with LizardTech to find new convenient ways of bringing our data to the American public through a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement CRADA Images compressed with MrSID can be viewed with a number of software packages Lizard Tech makes available a number of different viewers for free With a reasonably modern computer the MrSID images can be used in a standalone viewer or viewed within a program such as ArcView PhotoShop or MicroStation To view Lake Tahoe DRGs in MrSID format over the internet footer image mrsid Lake Tahoe click here Blue Bar Bathymetry Question Can I see objects on the bottom of Lake Tahoe Answer The bathymetry project was not trying to uncover archaeological objects If an object was large enough it would show up in the bathymetric map however it might be hard to distinguish it from a natural feature The USGS is concerned about the protection of cultural artifacts and has not made any effort to highlight them Question Is there a poster version of the bathymetry available Answer Yes The Carson City Nevada office of the USGS created a poster which includes bathymetry called Selected Hydrologic Features of the Lake Tahoe Basin California and Nevada Click here for a images bathymetry ofr 98 649 gif view of the poster Two posters are contained in Bathymetry and Selected Prespective
