Resource Center About NIAP The National Information Assurance Partnership NIAP is a U S Government initiative designed to meet the security testing evaluation and assessment needs of both information technology IT producers and consumers NIAP is a collaboration between the National Institute of Standards and Technology NIST and the National Security Agency NSA in fulfilling their respective responsibilities under the Computer Security Act of 1987 The partnership originated in 1997 combines the extensive security experience of both agencies to promote the development of technically sound security requirements for IT products and systems and appropriate metrics for evaluating those products and systems The long term goal of NIAP is to help increase the level of trust consumers have in their information systems and networks through the use of cost effective security testing evaluation and assessment programs NIAP continues to build important relationships with government agencies and industry in a variety of areas to help meet current and future IT security challenges affecting the nation s critical information infrastructure Now available 10 04 02 niap events systemacq

PRIORITY SYSTEM CERTIFICATION AND ACCREDITATION PROJECT October 28 2002 The National Institute of Standards and Technology NIST has released a draft of a new cybersecurity guideline designed to help protect Federal sensitive systems NIST Special Publication 800 37 Guidelines for the Security Certification and Accreditation of Federal Information Technology Systems is being made available in draft for review and comment by federal agencies and other interested organizations Under Office of Management and Budget OMB policy responsible federal officials are required to make a security determination called accreditation to authorize placing IT systems into operation In order for these officials to make sound risk based decisions a security evaluation known as certification of the IT system is needed The new NIST cybersecurity guideline 800 37 establishes standard processes depending upon the sensitivity and exposure of the system to verify the correctness and effectiveness of security controls to ensure adequate security Consult the new NIST certification and accreditation web site at http csrc nist gov sec cert http csrc nist gov sec cert MEMORANDUM CLARIFYING NSTISSP NO

REQUIREMENTS PROJECT The events of September 11th have strengthened our resolve to protect the information systems and networks that play an important role in the United States critical information infrastructure Fighting the war on terrorism will be a multifaceted undertaking with renewed efforts in the area of cyber security NIST and NSA have recently announced a new collaborative effort to produce comprehensive security requirements and security specifications for key technologies that will be used to build more secure systems for our Federal Agencies These security requirements and security specifications will be developed with significant industry involvement and employ the new international security standard known as the Common Criteria ISO IEC 15408 Protection profiles in key technology areas such as operating systems firewalls smart cards biometrics devices database systems public key infrastructure components network devices virtual private networks intrusion detection systems and web browsers will be the primary focus of this high priority project The National Information Assurance Partnership web site will be the primary distribution vehicle used to disseminate information on the status of all development efforts associated with this project Additional information can be obtained by downloading the project description see below or by contacting Dr Stuart
