November 12 2003 Imagine you re in California It s July the middle of summer The sun rises early bright rays warm the ground It s a great day to be outside Then suddenly it begins to snow not just a little flurry but a swirling blizzard that doesn t stop for two weeks That s what forecasters call unseasonal weather It sounds incredible but something like that just happened on the sun says David Hathaway a solar physicist at NASA s Marshall Space Flight Center Only a few weeks ago solar activity was low The face of the sun was nearly blank very few sunspots says Hathaway and space weather near Earth was mild Mild is just what we expect at this point in the 11 year solar cycle he explains The most recent maximum was in 2001 and solar activity has been declining ever since images haywire Sandy1 jpg Then suddenly in late October the sun began to behave strangely Three giant sunspots appeared each one larger than the planet Jupiter In California where smoke from wildfires dimmed the sun enough to look straight at it casual sky watchers were startled by the huge blotches on the sun One of them named sunspot 486 was the biggest in 13 years Right Astrophotographer Bob Sandy of Virginia took this picture of giant sunspot 486 emerging over the sun s limb on Oct 23 2003 It is preceded by another giant spot numbered 484 images haywire Sandy1 jpg more Sunspots cause solar flares and usually the biggest flares come from the biggest spots The three giant sunspots unleashed eleven X class flares in only fourteen days equaling the total number observed during the previous twelve months This was a big surprise says Hathaway The effects on Earth were many Radio blackouts disrupted communications Solar protons penetrated Earth s upper atmosphere exposing astronauts and some air travelers to radiation doses equal to a medical chest X ray Auroras appeared all over the world in Florida Texas Australia and many other places where they are seldom seen Researchers rank solar flares according to their x ray power output C flares are the weakest M flares are middling strong X flares are the most powerful Each category has subdivisions e g X1 X2 X3 and so on A typical X flare registers X1 or X2 On Nov 4th sunspot 486 unleashed an X28 flare the most powerful ever recorded http sohowww nascom nasa gov hotshots 2003 11 04 Left An extreme ultraviolet telescope onboard the orbiting Solar and Heliospheric Observatory SOHO captured this false color movie of the Nov 4 2003 X28 superflare near the sun s limb http sohowww nascom nasa gov hotshots 2003 11 04 more In 1989 a flare about half that strong caused a widespread power blackout in Quebec recalls Hathaway Last week s blast was aimed away from Earth so its effects on our planet were slight a bit of good luck All this happened two years after solar maximum which raises a question is something wrong with the solar cycle Is the sun going haywire Nothing s wrong reassures Hathaway The sun isn t about to explode nor is the sunspot cycle broken These latest sunspots were whoppers he allows but sunspot counts averaged over many weeks are still declining as predicted We re still on course for a solar minimum in 2006 Indeed it s possible that what we ve just experienced is a normal part of the solar cycle speculates Hathaway There s a curious tendency for the biggest flares to occur after solar maximum on the downslope toward solar minimum This has happened during two of the last three solar cycles The plot below illustrates his point Below Using data ftp ftp ngdc noaa gov STP SOLAR DATA SOLAR FLARES XRAY

sun was rapidly approaching the 1985 86 solar minimum Suddenly a giant sunspot appeared Jupiter sized like sunspot 486 and unleashed two dozen M flares and three X flares including a remarkable flare registering X13 People then probably wondered too if the solar cycle was broken It s hard to be sure what s normal and what s not notes Hathaway Astronomers have been observing x rays from the sun for only 35 years or three solar cycles We can t draw good statistical conclusions from so few data news subscribe htm subscription image Sign up for EXPRESS SCIENCE NEWS delivery One thing is certain though flurries of solar activity can happen at any time The next time says Hathaway could be just a week or so away Sunspot 486 and its companions are on the far side of the sun now carried around by the sun s 27 day rotation We suspect they re still active says Hathaway because the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory a sun watching satellite has photographed clouds of gas being thrown over the sun s limb by unseen explosions Unless these sunspots dissipate which could happen they will reappear on the Earth facing side of the sun beginning as early as Nov 14th And then No one knows We might get some more unseasonal space weather says Hathaway But this time he won t be surprised http science nasa gov programs mail sendfriend asp SEND THIS STORY TO A FRIEND Credits Contacts Author mailto
