BANK OF THE UNITED STATES BEFORE THE SUBCOMMITTEE ON FOREIGN OPERATIONS COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS U S HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 2 00 PM WEDNESDAY MARCH 26 2003 H 144 THE CAPITOL Chairman Kolbe Ranking Member Lowey Members of the Subcommittee I am happy to testify in support of the administration s fiscal year 2004 budget request for the Export Import Bank I will summarize my testimony in this presentation and ask to have my written statement submitted for the record Before I get into the numbers I want to reiterate the Bank s renewed commitment to our mission and requirements following the 2002 reauthorization of Ex Im Bank That means Supporting U S exports thereby helping to create and maintain U S jobs Leveling the playing field abroad for US business Maintaining our statutory requirement to find a reasonable assurance of repayment For almost 70 years Ex Im Bank has supported more than 400 billion in U S exports The customers for our services are U S exporters and those businesses and workers who are employed producing those exports As a businessman and once again a public servant I can tell you customer service is a primary goal for the Bank In this statement I would like to highlight two principal points The Administration s FY04 budget request for Ex Im Bank and Ex Im s ability and plans to use that budget to implement the authority and guidance given us by Congress FISCAL YEAR 2004 BUDGET REQUEST Let me approach the description of the Bank s FY04 budget request by defining four important terms Program budget Administrative budget Carryover and Risk Reserve For each fiscal year Ex Im Bank has two parts to its budget request 1 Program budget which provides the reserves to cover defaults or any losses we might incur and 2 Administrative budget which provides us the operating funds to keep the doors open pay our employees upgrade computer systems and reach out to inform U S exporters of our products Two other important terms are 3 Carryover which refers to program budget authority that was available but not used in a given fiscal year In Ex Im Bank s case carryover is available for up to four years 4 Risk Reserve which refers to the amount Ex Im Bank is required to set aside to cover default losses This is determined by an Office of Management and Budget OMB formula It is approximately equivalent to what in a commercial bank would be called the loan loss reserve These terms all fit together to form this year s budget request for the Bank I refer you to the chart attached to this testimony noted as Appendix 1 That chart illustrates the categories to which I am about to refer Program Budget Authority and Carryover For FY04 Ex Im Bank is requesting no new program budget authority because we have the authority to carry over unutilized funds from the four previous fiscal years That carry over is sufficient to authorize the entire 14 6 billion in export credit demand we anticipate for FY04 This anticipated demand is a significant increase over the levels of export credits authorized by the Bank in FY02 10 1 Billion and anticipated to be authorized in FY03 12 8 Billion The amount of program budget we need to meet this anticipated demand is determined by the risk reserve which is the amount of money the Bank is required to set aside for possible losses Usually we provide for this through the annual appropriations process However this year FY04 we have sufficient carryover to meet our anticipated credit demand of 14 6 billion Risk Reserve Let me note risk ratings for individual countries are set through a 13 member interagency process called the Inter Agency Country Risk Assessment System or ICRAS We apply these country risk ratings and apply a formula established by OMB to determine the risk reserve In FY02 Ex Im s average risk reserve charge was 7 3 of the amount of credits authorized It fell to 1 69 for FY 03 It is estimated to be 3 3 for FY04 Over the last decade the amount of actual losses have averaged around 2 2 The Bank s calculations on anticipated demand of 14 6 billion carryover of 680 million and risk reserve of 3 3 means we have sufficient funds to support U S exporter needs without additional appropriations for program funds in FY04 ADMINISTRATIVE BUDGET The second portion of our budget request the Administrative budget funds the vital functions of running the Bank and fulfilling the goals set forth in our reauthorization The Administration is requesting 75 4 million an increase of 7 5 million from the 67 9 million recently enacted for FY 2003 Approximately 75 of the Administrative budget represents relatively fixed costs for the running of the Bank The remaining 25 is available to broaden our efforts to better meet the needs of U S exporters To meet the needs of our customers we need to bring our efforts into the 21st century This means continuing to upgrade our electronic communication systems to help us achieve the following objectives Better user friendly access for interested exporters through the internet and otherwise We need to respond to requests for information quickly and standardize forms so the average exporter can make sense of them and so it can be submitted electronically We are also taking steps to improve our cycle time in response to applications In addition we need to increase outreach to small and medium size businesses minority and women owned businesses and renewable energy efforts We believe these efforts are important and that belief was reinforced by Congressional guidance We cannot set aside the importance of face to face meetings with exporters but outreach through electronic means is increasingly important Administrative budget funding is particularly essential for our support of small business There are two different measures of Ex Im support for small business number of transactions we support and dollar amount of support In FY02 86 of the total number of Ex Im transactions 2 154 directly benefited small businesses In the 2002 reauthorization bill Congress increased from 10 to 20 the amount of the Bank s authority that shall be made available to finance exports directly by small businesses I note that in 2002 18 of the dollar amount of Ex Im Bank authorizations went directly to small businesses These numbers do not include numerous small business sub suppliers supported through larger transactions As the Chairman of the Export Import Bank of the United States my job is to support U S exporters and thereby maintain and create jobs I take seriously the intention of Congress to ensure that the Bank focuses as much as possible on small and medium size exporters There are approximately 240 000 such small and medium size exporters in the U S and a staff at Ex Im of only 400 people It is a truism that 10 of the fishermen catch 90 of the fish and that is because they go where the fish are U S exporters reside in every state and every congressional district throughout the U S These exporters can best be reached through banks financial institutions and trade finance specialists that are staffed by people who understand export finance They know how to guide exporters through the initial stages of the export financing mystique For this we need improved electronic systems as well as sustained personal contact That is what the increase in our administrative budget is largely for CONCLUSION Mr Chairman in some aspects the mandate of the Bank remains constant the same today as it was five years ago or twenty years ago Our mission is to support the maintenance and creation of jobs here in the United States by financing exports that would not otherwise go forward and help level the playing field for US companies when they are up against foreign competitors While the Bank s mission remains essentially the same we also need to be fast on our feet to address specific needs and shifts in the global economy With your continued support Ex Im Bank will adapt to those changes and needs as we support US exports and US jobs That concludes my testimony I am pleased to answer any questions you may have Appendix I EX IM BANK FY 2004 APPROPRIATIONS REQUEST Program Budget

balance available to carry over 679 7 326 5 In FY 2003 Ex Im Bank and all US government international credit programs have used a more focused formula to calculate default risks decreasing the proportionate amount of reserve that is set aside in case of default and therefore decreasing the requisite program budget need Difference between budget used and balance available to use privacy htm
