Assistance Plan for Implementation of Executive Order 13166 Improving Access to Services for Persons with Limited English Proficiency Revised January 2 2003 horizontal rule Background Executive Order 13166 EO 13166 Improving Access to Services for Persons with Limited English Proficiency was created to improve access to federally conducted and federally assisted programs and activities for people who as a result of national origin are limited in their English proficiency LEP President Bush affirmed his commitment to EO 13166 through a memorandum issued on October 25 2001 from the Department of Justice DOJ EO 13166 contains two major initiatives The first is designed to better enforce and implement an existing obligation Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits recipients of federal financial assistance from discriminating based on national origin by among other things failing to provide meaningful access to individuals who are LEP The Executive Order requires federal agencies that provide federal financial assistance to develop guidance to clarify those obligations for recipients of such assistance Second the Executive Order sets forth a new obligation Because the Federal Government adheres to the principles of nondiscrimination and inclusion embodied in Title VI the Executive Order requires all federal agencies to meet the same standards as federal financial assistance recipients in providing meaningful access for LEP individuals to federally conducted programs Each federal agency must thus develop a plan for providing that access Anything a federal agency does including all contact with the public falls within the scope of federally conducted and assisted programs or activities The definition of federally conducted and assisted programs is the same under EO 13166 as it is under Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 EO 13166 requires that all federal agencies take reasonable steps to provide meaningful access to their own federally conducted activities Each agency must develop and begin to implement a plan of action by December 11 2000 The National Council on Disability s NCD limitedenglish html LEP plan was completed and posted to its Web site on December 12 2000 The Coordination and Review Section of the Civil Rights Division at DOJ has taken the lead in coordinating and implementing this Executive Order National Council on Disability The National Council on Disability NCD is a small independent federal agency with a staff of 12 NCD s mandate is to make recommendations to the President and Congress on disability policy Therefore its primary audiences are the President and Congress NCD s budget is approximately 3 million annually with a preponderance of it going to administrative costs and overhead As such NCD will apply the reasonable accommodation standard to LEP issues as it does for disability issues In order to avoid the risk of limiting or curtailing other important policy work that will benefit all people with disabilities and the larger community agencies with smaller budgets will need additional funding to carry out this mandate NCD recommends that the Administration ensure that small agencies receive adequate funding to carry out this mandate The United States is a diversified nation According to the Census there are more than 50 million people with disabilities in the United States However this does not include those living in institutions The number of Hispanic Americans with disabilities 4 417 000 is greater than the population of South Carolina 3 885 736 The number of Native and Asian Pacific Americans with disabilities 1 446 000 is greater than the population of Maine 1 253 040 NCD s policy of outreach to people with disabilities who are culturally diverse and LEP is long standing In 1995 NCD translated its brochure http www ncd gov brochure html National Council on Disability At a Glance into http www ncd gov brochure span pdf Spanish In 1998 NCD conducted a public hearing in San Francisco To encourage the participation of people with LEP and specifically to ensure input from the Asian Pacific Islander and Hispanic communities the hearing was conducted simultaneously in Spanish English and Cantonese Then NCD translated its 1999 report http www ncd gov newsroom publications lift report html Lift Every Voice Modernizing Disability Policies and Programs to Serve a Diverse Nation into http www ncd gov newsroom publications pdf lift report span pdf Spanish and http www ncd gov newsroom publications 99publications html Chinese Lift Every Voice was based on input from stakeholders at a meeting in San Francisco In Lift Every Voice NCD highlighted one recommendation to the President and Congress in particular that has potential to enhance the impact of current policies and programs for people with disabilities who are culturally diverse and LEP It reads NCD has learned from grassroots witnesses that the best way to empower people from diverse cultures with disabilities and their families to take full advantage of federal laws programs and services is to provide them with easy to understand culturally appropriate information about what their rights are under various federal laws e g ADA the Rehabilitation Act IDEA the Fair Housing Act and how best to exercise those rights when a violation occurs To address this issue directly NCD recommends that an interagency team composed of representatives from the departments of Education Labor Health and Human Services Justice and Housing and Urban Development along with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission Small Business Administration and Federal Communications Commission develop and implement a large scale outreach and training program The initiative will 1 be targeted to people with disabilities from diverse cultural backgrounds and their families 2 involve people with disabilities from diverse cultures in all phases of planning and implementation 3 provide information directly to the target communities through a series of trainings across the country 4 include among those who provide training leaders recognized within a cultural group and 5 use training strategies that are appropriate for specific communities and groups across the country These trainings should be repeated periodically so that new people are trained each year and materials are routinely updated This interagency team should work with disability communities diverse cultural communities and a broad array of organizations representing different types of disabilities ethnic racial religious and other interests The interagency team should invite these representatives to participate in the development ofa workplan timetables and appropriate stakeholder consultation as it begins its work In addition NCD recommends that the interagency team recruit train and contract with a core group comprised of people with disabilities from diverse cultural backgrounds and their family members to help 1 develop the written materials and programs that will be used for the trainings 2 translate materials into many languages with sensitivity to cultural appropriateness of terminology and 3 conduct the trainings once the appropriate materials are translated field tested on sample groups and produced for dissemination in communities The federal partners should make efforts to include and accommodate often overlooked groups among the people to be trained and the core group of trainers These include but are not limited to young adults with disabilities people in rural or isolated locations including tribal communities people with mental disabilities and people with limited English proficiency Finally NCD recommends that Congress should provide support funding to the federal sponsors of the trainings in order to eliminate any potential financial barriers to participation so that the population trained will truly represent the population to be served In 2000 NCD translated its 500 page report http www ncd gov newsroom publications backtoschool 1 html Back to School on Civil Rights into http www ncd gov newsroom publications pdf backtoschool span pdf Spanish and provided language translators for selected regional briefings NCD also began translating and disseminating selected news releases and media advisories into Spanish and Chinese As a continuation of its cultural diversity and LEP outreach in 2001 NCD added language translation software to its award winning Web page http www ncd gov http www ncd gov This language translation

LEP persons in the eligible service population 2 the frequency with which LEP individuals come into contact with the program 3 the importance of the service provided by the program and 4 the resources available to the recipient Beginning with its quarterly meeting in February 2001 NCD made it standard practice to also ask those people with disabilities who are LEP to request reasonable language translation accommodations in advance of each meeting Implementation Plan for the NCD Office NCD will provide language translation and assistance to any person with a disability who is LEP and in need of assistance This will include telephone calls and office visits NCD also uses language identification flash cards to help in this effort NCD will notify staff on how to obtain needed services
