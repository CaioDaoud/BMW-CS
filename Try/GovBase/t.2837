Industry of the Future portfolio pages listed below agriculture portfolio shtml Agriculture Portfolio metalcast portfolio shtml Metal Casting Portfolio The biobased products industry has taken the lead in defining its technology needs OIT s Agriculture portfolio consists of R D projects that meet those needs The projects are designed to explore the creation of commodity chemicals from glucose new enzyme processing methods enhanced utilization of corn the production of chemicals from lignocellulose soy based engine oils and products from wheat milling Coordinated through the Cast Metals Coalition the metal casting industry is implementing the IOF strategy and transforming metal casting processes by funding R D efforts in manufacturing materials environmental improvements new products and applications aluminum portfolio shtml Aluminum Portfolio mining portfolio shtml Mining Portfolio Guided by industry defined priorities ITP provides cost shared support to a balanced portfolio of Aluminum RD D projects The projects fall into the categories of primary and secondary aluminum production casting forming and finishing and recycling The ITP mining portfolio is built around industry priorities Focused research projects fall under the priority categories of exploration and resource characterization drilling and excavating material transfer mine operations mineral preparation physical preparation physical separation and chemical separation chemicals portfolio shtml Chemicals Portfolio petroleum portfolio shtml Petroleum Portfolio Based on meeting industry defined priorities and recommendations the Chemical Industry of the Future portfolio includes R D projects in chemical synthesis bioprocesses and biotechnology process science and engineering computational technology and materials ITP has worked with the petroleum industry under the leadership of the American Petroleum Institute s Technology Committee and the National Petrochemical and Refiners Associations to define Petroleum industry priorities The Petroleum portfolio addresses those priorities with projects designed to improve energy and process efficiency environmental performance and material and inspection technology forest portfolio shtml Forest Products Portfolio steel portfolio shtml Steel Portfolio The ITP Forest Products R D portfolio addresses a broad spectrum of industry priorities Among them are energy savings and process improvements in wood preparation and raw materials pulping bleaching chemical recovery papermaking recycling recovery and emission controls The steel industry guided by the American Iron and Steel Institute and the Steel Manufacturers Association has identified research and development priorities with ITP The Steel portfolio addresses these priorities with projects designed to explore process efficiency iron unit recycling environmental engineering and production efficiency glass portfolio shtml Glass Portfolio combustion rd portfolio shtml Combustion Industry plays a central role in focusing the ITP Glass team research investment on near and long term goals Current Glass research projects are looking at saving energy and costs in batch preparation and charging melting and refining forming and finishing Through selective cost shared R D projects DOE and industry are laying the foundation for enhanced combustion performance focusing on applications designated as priorities by IOF industries and in the Combustion program vision and technology roadmap While developments at the component level will remain important breakthroughs in efficiency productivity safety and environmental performance hinge on optimizing combustion processes from a total systems perspective imf portfolio shtml Industrial Materials for the
