at the cellular organ and organismal levels of organization The emphasis is on sublethal effects of chemicals and other stressors that lead to behavioral developmental and population level effects that ultimately can influence ecosystem health One area of interest involves examining the effects of various chemicals and mixtures of chemicals on neurotransmitter receptor pathways in the central and peripheral nervous systems in laboratory studies and in field collected samples The chemicals of interest range from chemicals of known mechanism of action to complex mixtures of environmental chemicals Two examples of these studies are 1 an examination of brain muscarinic cholinergic receptors in surrogate and listed species exposed to various chemicals and 2 an examination of brain acetyl cholinesterase and muscarinic cholinergic receptors in the little brown bat as a surrogate for the endangered Indiana bat An additional area of interest is in examining the effects of natural and unnatural stressors on Na K ATPase and plasma Cl as indicators of changes in gill function and plasma osmolality up to titles up to titles Reproductive Responses Environmental chemicals can interfere with endocrine hormone function Hormones regulate nearly all physiological functions such as growth development and reproduction The degree to which this interference is occurring both in wildlife and human populations is uncertain and is complicated by the number of classes of chemicals that influence endocrine function Most evidence of environmentally induced hormone disruption in both wildlife and humans has been obtained from highly exposed populations Our approach however is to examine subtle impacts on hormonal systems occurring within a gradients of contamination that could result in population effects We are approaching this complex problem through both basic and applied research A major area of emphasis involves studying the normal processes of sexual differentiation and development of fishes in conjunction with the disruptive effects induced by exposure to chemical contaminants Focus areas in these studies include primary germ cells nuage material gonadogenesis gametogenesis secondary sexual characteristics and sexual behaviors A second area of emphasis focuses on assessing estrogenicity of single or complex mixtures of chemicals in fish by measuring an estrogen dependent plasma phosphoprotein vitellogenin in immature female or male fish where it would not normally be found These types of studies have also been applied to field collected plasma samples The applied research is focused on the characterization of exposure and effects in populations of fish and wildlife from various locations The studies are conducted with field biologists and often include the assessment of biological indicators of effects that were developed in the laboratory The goals of these studies are to develop linkages among sublethal effects at the cell or tissue level and adverse population level effects A final approach is to expose developing embryos to complex mixtures of chemicals taken from specific sites These studies are conducted to gain information about the interaction of chemicals from a given site and the potential for synergism or antagonism to occur up to titles up to titles Statistical Analysis and Consulting CERC provides statistical

address the status of the population and the potential impacts of particular contaminants on such populations with further implications for management up to titles up to titles Ultraviolet Radiation The Columbia Environmental Research Center has unique solar simulation facilities for investigating the biological effects of ultraviolet radiation and the potential synergistic interactions between aquatic contaminants and sunlight The solar simulators generate UVB UVA and visible radiation in sufficient intensities and ratios to approximate natural sunlight This blend of wavelengths is necessary not only for simulating solar radiation but also to provide sufficient radiation to induce natural photorepair mechanisms for an accurate estimate of UV effects The operation of the system through programmable controllers provides daily exposures of natural durations of visible and ultraviolet radiation The system encloses a temperature controlled water bath where the test organisms are held Exposures are quantified with a scanning spectroradiometer that measures the surface and underwater intensities of UV and visible light at one nm intervals from 260 to 800 nm The spectroradiometer can also be used in the field to determine natural radiation intensities at specific sites To date CERC has exposed fish amphibians and aquatic invertebrates in the solar simulators to assess the potential impact of stratospheric ozone depletion the consequences of UV exposure resulting from increases in water column clarity and the photoenhanced toxicity of pesticides and petroleum products up to titles up to titles Water Quality and Chemistry The Columbia Environmental Research Center has unique laboratory experimental ecosystem and field capabilities for the assessment of the effects of water quality on natural resources the biological significance of degraded water quality Water quality consists of a myriad of factors including dissolved oxygen temperature nutrients organic carbon pH alkalinity dissolved solids and minerals These components can be limiting factors in aquatic ecosystems as well as important determinants of the fate and effects of contaminants in the environment The Center also has unique capabilities for continuous in situ monitoring of water quality in natural environments For example multi probe water quality monitors have been used to examine the diurnal and seasonal changes in dissolved oxygen salinity pH conductivity and temperature in estuarine environments important in the reproductive ecology of species such as striped bass Such studies can provide unique insights into the influence of hydrologic alteration in the presence of industrial and agricultural chemicals up to titles up to titles
