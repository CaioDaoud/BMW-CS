Pipeline http newscenter cancer gov NCI News Center news newsletter asp Frontiers in Science CCR newsletter news archive asp CCR News In the Pipeline In the Pipeline is a web based publication that presents new research conducted by scientists at NIH s Center for Cancer Research in a brief easy to digest format breaking down studies into bite sized pieces The CCR composed of over 300 Principal Investigators in 54 Laboratories Branches and Programs is one of the world s largest cancer research centers The CCR takes advantage of the breadth of its researchers to foster interdisciplinary programs and facilitate translational research Basic research is a strength of the CCR which also has broad areas of excellence in clinical and translational research In the Pipeline editors strive to select various journal articles and projects to adequately reflect the depth and breadth of the work being done here If you have a suggestion of a subject for In the Pipeline please submit your idea through the http ccrintra cancer gov news form form asp CCR News Submission Form Validating microarray experiments The use of microarray technology to measure gene expression profiles is increasingly popular in the biomedical community There has been great progress in the field but investigators still struggle with the question of how to validate the large data sets generated by this procedure In the December 2002 Nature Genetics Supplement researchers from the Center for Cancer Research Pathogenetics Unit the Laboratory of Pathology and the Urologic Oncology Branch reviewed current approaches caveats and future directions for verifying global expression results To view the abstract http www ncbi nlm nih gov entrez query fcgi cmd Retrieve db PubMed list uids 12454646 dopt Abstract click here Critical targets for common soft tissue sarcoma Rhabdomyosarcoma RMS is the most common soft tissue sarcoma in children yet molecular events associated with disease genesis and progression are largely unknown For implicated molecules and pathways the lack of a mouse model has impeded genetic validation In the November 2002 issue of Nature Medicine researchers from the Laboratory of Molecular Biology and the Pediatric Branch National Cancer Institute and colleagues report data from the study of INK4a Arf mice transgenic for hepatocyte growth factor scatter factor HGF SF The data indicate that the human proto oncogene c MET and INK4a ARF represent critical targets in RMS pathogenesis To view the abstract http www ncbi nlm nih gov entrez query fcgi cmd Retrieve db PubMed list

and it has been proposed that receptor polymorphisms may be linked to prostate cancer susceptibility In the January 2002 issue of Urologia Internationalis researchers in the Medicine Branch National Cancer Institute examined the inverse relationship between a highly polymorphic trinucleotide repeat CAG in the androgen receptor and the receptor s transactivation function They found no correlation between CAG length and time to progression or survival time but they did find a significant correlation between Gleason score and CAG length suggesting that shorter CAG lengths may predict a higher histological grade of prostate cancer To view the abstract http www ncbi nlm nih gov entrez query fcgi cmd Retrieve db PubMed list uids 11803263 dopt Abstract click here Proteasome Inhibitor Therapy for Leukemia Nuclear factor kappaB NF kappaB plays a major role in the pathogenesis of human T cell lymphotrophic virus I associated malignancy Proteasome inhibitors offer a rational approach to controlling constitutively activated NF kappaB in human T cell lymphotrophic virus I infected T cells In the February 2002 issue of Cancer Research researchers from the Metabolism Branch Center for Cancer Research report that proteasome inhibitor PS 341 decreased NF kappaB DNA binding activity by preventing IkappaB alpha degradation PS 341 alone did not prolong survival of tumor bearing mice When combined with humanized anti Tac however PS 341 therapy was associated with complete remission in some of the animals To view the abstract http www ncbi nlm nih gov entrez query fcgi cmd Retrieve

the presence of two regions of homology called polo box 1 PB1 and 2 PB2 in the C terminal non catalytic domain In the August 2002 issue of The Journal of Biological Chemistry researchers from the Center for Cancer Research and colleagues showed that both PB1 and PB2 are needed to target Plk1 catalytic activity to centrosomes midbody and kinetochores They propose that polo box dependent Plk1 activity is required in mammalian cells for proper metaphase anaphase transition and cytokinesis To view the abstract http www ncbi nlm nih gov entrez query fcgi cmd Retrieve db PubMed list uids
