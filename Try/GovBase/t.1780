Ferraiolo and Kuhn is attracting increasing attention because it reduces the complexity and cost of security administration in large networked applications Most information technology vendors have incorporated RBAC into their product line and the technology is finding applications in areas ranging from health care to defense in addition to the mainstream commerce systems for which it was

Security administration can be costly and prone to error because administrators usually specify access control lists for each user on the system individually With RBAC security is managed at a level that corresponds closely to the organization s structure Each user is assigned one or more roles and each role is assigned one or more privileges that are permitted to users in that role Security administration with RBAC consists of determining the operations that must be executed by persons in particular jobs and assigning employees to the proper roles Complexities introduced by mutually exclusive roles or role hierarchies are handled by the RBAC software making security administration easier This web resource explains RBAC concepts costs vs benefits and economic impact of RBAC design
