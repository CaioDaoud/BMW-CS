Fires in the Northwest United States from NASA s Earth Observatory Multisensor Fire Observations Exacerbated by ongoing drought the 2002 U S fire season was one of the worst in half a century Wildfires are not unique to the United States Since fire is a natural part of the Earth s ecosystems wildfires can occur at any time anywhere on the planet NASA satellite data is providing scientists and fire managers with unparalleled insight into how deadly fires behave and how to fight them To illustrate the use of multisensor fire observations NASA has produced a video animation sequence of the 2002 fire season Starting with a global view the animation gradually zooms in on three large fires in the United States the Hayman Fire in Colorado the merged Rodeo and Chediski Fires in Arizona and the Biscuit Fire in Oregon The Earth science data featured in this video animation sequence are managed and distributed by NASA s Earth Observing System Data and Information System EOSDIS through the nine member data centers of the Distributed Active Archive Center DAAC Alliance The featured data represent only a small sample of the many EOSDIS data products useful in hazard management and in studying weather related events For more information about EOSDIS data information data products data services and data handling tools please contact the appropriate DAAC User Services office listed under box EOSDIS Data Selected Fire Animation Images Hayman Fire In June 2002 Colorado experienced the Hayman Fire which burned for nearly a month In this image MISR multiangle observations are combined to yield a three dimensional view of the Hayman smoke and soot plume spreading over Denver The plume reached elevations of a few kilometers above the surface The MODIS land cover shows populated areas in dark red Rodeo Chediski Fire While the Hayman Fire burned the Rodeo and Chediski Fires in Arizona merged into the largest fire in state history Landsat 7 ETM data show details of the burned area from June 21 to July 7 Note that not all of the pine forest within the fires perimeter has burned to the same degree High resolution land data displays burned areas in red Biscuit Fire Almost one week later the Sour Biscuit and Florence Fires began in southern Oregon As updrafts drew the two fires together they merged and continued to burn as the Biscuit Fire ASTER thermal data for August 14 show details of the burned area High resolution thermal data precisely detail burned areas dark purple and active fires bright purple This close up scene follows the fire s spread and resulting destruction EOSDIS Data The DAAC Alliance provides access to EOSDIS data products data handling tools and data services For information about the EOSDIS data products used in this animation
