CLIMATE CHANGE and VARIABILITY PROGRAM Task Leader res Profiles lofgren html Brent Lofgren This research program brings together projects that examine the potential effects of climate change on the Great Lakes water resources and ecosystem Conduct studies to identify and improve our understanding of the impacts of climate change and variability on socio economic frameworks and ecosystem structure and function including those through intermediate effects such as changes in the water supply of the Great Lakes Basin This will aid in improving planning for regional adaptation strategies Analyze and model climate variables over the last 100 years and projections in the future to identify the implications to regional water resources ice cover water levels and ecosystem health in the
