server and services offered through the LNBL Visualization Group The primary aims of the Visualization Group at NERSC are Work with users to provide Better better visualization of their data The Visualization Group at NERSC collaborates with researchers from various scientific disciplines to enhance and develop visualization tools for their data Enhance Enhance the scope of visualization software and hardware available The Visualization Group at NERSC are continually researching and improving existing visualization tools in response to the requirements of the NERSC User community Users who require visualization capabilities can http hpcf nersc gov forms server request html obtain an account on the NERSC Visualization server computers servers escher php escher nersc gov Educate Educate the user community about visualization tools and techniques which are currently available NERSC personnel often host classes for users and provide lots of informative web pages and examples on various http www vis lbl gov site info gallery html visualization techniques and http hpcf nersc gov software libs graphics visualization libraries Visualization group members also regularly attend conferences and are willing to advise educate users on suitable hardware configurations and software packages to satisfy their visualization requirements The http www vis lbl gov overview html History and Overview of The Visualization Group describes Scientific Visualization in more detail Better Visualization Motivation Why Visualize Scientific Data It is often difficult to understand or communicate information from complex or large datasets Scientific Visualization provides the techniques algorithms to extract and display the important information from data derived from experiments or simulations Scientific visualization has maximum impact when the data has more than two dimensions and when a researcher wants to explore and understand his her data The http www vis lbl gov site info gallery html Visualization Group Gallery describes many examples of the use of Visualization techniques in various scientific disciplines Enhance the Scope Collaboration and Research Projects NERSC Visualization personnel research and develop new tools in response to the needs of the NERSC User community Such projects are especially endorsed when the research can be deemed relevant to a broad cross section of NERSC users and researchers See http www vis lbl gov projects html LBNL Visualization Group Projects for details of ongoing and past projects For more information on collaborations and research projects please contact the Visualization Group at mailto vis lbl gov vis lbl gov The Visualization Group are currently involved in research in the following areas Visualization of multi resolution grids Visualization of very large terabyte size data High end visualization over wide area networks Parallel Volume rendering User collaborations play a large part in the development and or enchancement of Visualization tools Some recent projects are as follows http www vis lbl gov projects html Visualizing the Interactions of Two Fluids This project involved the creation of a tool to compare multi species time dependent datasets in collaboration with NERSC users at the College of William Mary Movie concepts were introduced to study the time dependent nature of the problem This provided immediate feedback which the researchers are using to tune the parameters for simulation The resulting tool was written in IDL and the tool and documentation are now available A major benefit of this project is the increased knowledge and use of IDL SEE http www rsinc com idl index c IDL Home Page for more details on IDL 3D Visualization for Climate Modeling This project is in collaboration with NERSC users at LLNL and so far has resulted in the addition of 3D visualization capabilities to their climate modeling tools The http www kitware com vtk html Visualization Toolkit Vtk was employed Researchers in the NERSC Visualization group also created a user interface to access this capability The result of this collaboration will be extended to other NERSC users It is envisioned that this project will be extended to add the ability to visualize time dependent data via animation as well as to explore new techniques such as volume rendering for visualizing climate modelling data Visualization of Large Datasets Members of the NERSC Visualization group are working with Visualization experts at http www pppl gov PPPL to help define and implement 3D visualization tools for PPPL data Current research involves optimization of the rendering time for visualization algorithms with large datasets The use of volume visualization techniques on the PPPL datasets as well as remote collaborations between high end servers are also under investigation Currently the prototype remote visualization tool http vis lbl gov projects visapult index html Visapult is being tested for this purpose For more information on Visualization at PPPL see http w3 pppl gov vde2000 Visualization Development Environments 2000 Visualization of Multi Resolution Grids This project is in collaboration with the Applied Numerical Algorithms Group ANAG based at LBNL This collaboration has resulted in a tool that extends standard visualization techniques from single grids to multi resolution grids known as Adaptive Mesh Refinement AMR The first version of this tool is called http seesar lbl gov anag software chombovis html ChomboVis and was released with ANAG s AMR Chombo software library in January 2000 Efforts are ongoing to parallelize Vtk for AMR data and to continue to develop new visualization tools and techniques for AMR Future proposed directions for this project will investigate standard formats built on top of HDF 5 for multi resolution data The capability to visualize time dependent data will be incorporated A major benefit of this research is that it will be released to Vtk developers for inclusion in future releases e g 3 2 Also see http www vis lbl gov projects ldrd99 index html FY1999 Combustion Vis LDRD Movie Creation
