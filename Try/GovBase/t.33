AMR Software Packages AMR Software Packages There are two independent AMR software packages available here The CCSE Software index html CCSE Applications Suite was developed by the CCSE index html Center for Computational Sciences and Engineering CCSE and contains updates of our previously released AMR software as well as new code for modeling incompressible flow on a structured hierarchy of grids For examples of the functionality of this software see the CCSE Research index html research highlights generated by researchers in CCSE and their collaborators using this code framework and its extensions Because of the modularity of the software design fundamental pieces of the AMR framework are shared by a number of different applications Other pieces of the software that are more application specific specify the exact details of the algorithm used for a particular application Visualization and data post processing tools for the AMR data sets generated by the CCSE software are included ANAG chombo index html Chombo was developed by the ANAG index html Applied Numerical Algorithms Group ANAG The package here is an updated version of that previously released and is carefully constructed to allow users to build their own AMR application in a fraction of the time it would take to build one from scratch In this release are sample codes to solve the Poisson equation the Helmholtz equation or the equations of gas dynamics using Godunov methodology using AMR Chombo is being extended to include the capability to model complex geometry A visualization tool for the AMR data sets generated by the Chombo software is included CCSE Software index html CCSE Software ANAG software html Chombo Software CCSE Software index html CCSE Applications Suite ANAG software html Chombo index html AMR Home Page
