Geological Survey USGS index html Toxic Substances Hydrology Toxics Program was initiated in 1982 The goal of the Program is to provide scientific information on the behavior of toxic substances in the Nation s hydrologic environments Contamination of surface water ground water soil sediment and the atmosphere by toxic substances is among the most significant issues facing the Nation Contaminants such as excessive definitions nutrients html nutrients organic chemicals metals and pathogens enter the environment often inadvertently via industrial agricultural mining or other human activities The extent of their migration and their persistence often are difficult to ascertain Estimates of the costs and time frames for cleanup of contamination and protection of human and environmental health can best be described as astounding despite continual efforts by governments and industries worldwide to improve environmental technologies The Toxics Program conducts 1 intensive field investigations of representative cases of subsurface contamination at local releases and 2 watershed and regional scale investigations of contamination affecting aquatic ecosystems from nonpoint and distributed point sources These investigations occur over a wide range of scales from intense point sources such as leaks or discharges from industrial facilities to multiple closely spaced releases such as domestic septic systems to relatively uniform releases that occur over broad areas with similar land use practices such as agricultural and residential land uses Common to the investigations at all these scales are the objectives to Measure the contaminants and their transformation products in environmental samples at levels low enough to characterize environmental processing Characterize the physical processes and properties that affect their propagation in the environment Define the chemical and microbial processes that transform degrade or otherwise affect the contaminant s transport Describe the influence of contaminants on organisms ecosystems the food chain and human health Understand the ultimate fate of contaminants in hydrologic systems and the potential long term implications for human and environmental health and Develop simulation models to assess potential exposure and design waste disposal facilities monitoring networks and remediation Scientists with a broad range of expertise including ecologists geologists chemists hydrologists geochemists biologists and digital data collection experts from across the USGS participate in Program activities In addition many scientists from universities other Federal agencies and industry are taking advantage of research opportunities afforded by the Program and its field sites and are active members of the research teams Most of the scientists are from USGS http water usgs gov wrd002 html District offices and the USGS http water usgs gov nrp National Research Program Each project is steered by a core group of scientists from the research team This core group led by the project coordinator s guides the development of a research plan that integrates the multi disciplinary activities at the site The Toxics Program is coordinated with the U S Environmental Protection Agency the U S Department of Agriculture the Department of Defense the Department of Energy the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and other U S Department of the Interior agencies to ensure that current and future research priorities are being addressed The Program complements the water quality monitoring and assessment programs of USGS and others by identifying new issues and emerging contaminants and developing the knowledge and methods needed to direct their future activities Collaboration and information sharing occurs with numerous state and local governments and non governmental entities The long term cooperation and assistance offered by the Federal State and local agencies and by private entities that administer or own the Program s research sites has been essential to the success of the Toxics Program Their continued support is greatly appreciated footer links http toxics
