QM dapsuser htm Appendices A 1 through A 8 Basically the first part of the QM relates to the EIRP of the received signal This signal strength is recorded as a number with an operating range from 32 to 57 dbm The next two units represent the DCP s transmit frequency offset with minus being lower than center frequency and plus being higher The next unit represents the frequency cycles that the DCP is off by times 50 cycles The next measurement would be DCP s modulation index which would either be N for normal L for low or H for high The final measurement is the DCP s data quality which would be either N for normal F for fair or P for poor Question 12 Why am I experiencing poor data quality Answer There are several reasons with some being interference poor DCP performance incorrect DCP
