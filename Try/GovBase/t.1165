gain antenna status SOHO is back in high rate contact via the DSN 26 meter antennas The spacecraft was rolled 180 with respect to its nominal attitude on July 8 to keep the high gain antenna pointing toward earth The spacecraft will continue in this mode of operation until late September when the next keyhole period will force the use of 34 meter and if possible 70 meter DSN antennas and a roll back to 0 for the following three months Earlier reports on the high gain antenna anomaly can be found on our soho hga history html HGA history page TRACE A http hea www harvard edu SSXG kathy flares
