a first of its kind multiwavelength gamma ray burst GRB observatory It has the optimum capabilities for the next breakthroughs in determining the origin of GRBs and their afterglows and using bursts to probe the early Universe It will also perform the first sensitive hard X ray survey of the sky A wide field gamma ray camera will detect approximately 1000 GRBs in 3 years with a sensitivity 5 times fainter than the BATSE detector aboard Compton GRO Sensitive narrow field X ray and UV optical telescopes will be pointed at the burst location in 20 to 70 seconds by an autonomously controlled swift spacecraft Swift is a medium sized explorer MIDEX mission selected by NASA for launch in January 2004 The hardware is being developed by an internatinoal team from the USA the United Kingdom and Italy with additional scientific involvement in France Japan Germany Denmark Spain and South Africa Swift will detect and acquire high precision locations for gamma ray bursts Swift will rapidly relay a 1 4 arc minute position estimate to the ground within 15 seconds After the initial burst detection Swift has the capability of quickly repointing to bring the burst within the field of view of X ray and UV Optical telescopes Swift will provide redshifts for the bursts and multi wavelength lightcurves for the duration of the afterglow In addition Swift s unique capabilities will be applied to
