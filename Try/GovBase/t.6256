Blossom user manual statistics statistical software analysis Download for the User Manual for Blossom Statistical Software Blossom is an interactive program for making statistical comparisons with distance function based permutation tests developed by P W Mielke Jr and colleagues at Colorado State University Mielke and Berry 2001 and for testing parameters estimated in linear models with permutation procedures developed by B S Cade and colleagues at the Midcontinent Ecological Science Center U S Geological Survey This manual is intended to update and replace earlier versions by W B Slauson B S Cade and J D Richards dated 1991 and 1994 We have expanded on material in earlier versions and provide documentation on new routines added since 1994 Routines added since 1994 include a permutation version of ordinary least squares OLS regression that parallels the least absolute deviation LAD regression permutation test a permutation and asymptotic chi square approximation of i P i values for a rank score statistic for regression quantiles simultaneous estimation of all regression quantiles empirical coverage tests for univariate goodness of fit and g sample comparisons that are
