qualitative quantitative differences in Analysis Center products Each of the Analysis Centers employs different software and a unique set of measurement and orbit models to produce weekly solutions which are then used to generate the IGS orbit combination Summaries of various AC processing strategies are provided ftp igscb jpl nasa gov igscb center analysis here along with contact information

forward your query to the appropriate contacts within the IGS Why does the official IGS ftp igscb jpl nasa gov pub station general igs 01 pcv igs 01 pcv table differ from the http www ngs noaa gov GRDweb GRD GPS Projects ANTCAL NGS calibration tables Which one should I use igs 01 pcv is the official table to be used in IGS analysis And yes it does differ from NGS latest table and even if you look closely also from NGS previous table The history is that some years back NGS and other groups doing calibrations collaborated to make a definitive IGS table by averaging the various measurements available Some time later the NGS table you see now came out We have not updated the IGS values to NGS latest in all cases for a few reasons we want to limit changes in IGS analysis to avoid jumps need new effort to determine best values to use it is thought now that averaging might mask some information We currently have an ad hoc committee which is working to obtain quality satellite pcv tables which would enable use of absolute rather than relative calibrations in a future update of the igs 01 pcv file At present when we get an antenna not yet in igs 01 pcv we inquire with a few regional networks such as EUREF whether they have any calibrations for it and if not we add the current NGS value In short if you are doing IGS analysis you should be using igs 01 pcv If not you should just be certain whatever you choose is consistent with your requirements What about satellite antenna offsets IGS Analysis Centers use Block II IIA 0 279 0 000 1 023 X Y Z in meters Block IIR 0
