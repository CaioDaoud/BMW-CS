Earth s magnetosphere have implications for other planets such as Venus Fok et al in an article recently accepted to the Journal of Geophysical Research have shown that at Venus because it has no intrinsic magnetic field the solar wind penetrates deep into its upper atmosphere click thumbnail image at right Calculating neutral atom emissions using the global MHD model of Tanaka and Murawski 1997 Fok et al show that energetic neutral atom emission from Venus magnetosheath is comparable to or even greater than that of the Earth leading to the natural conclusion that low energy neutral atom imaging may be used to study the solar wind Venus interaction in particular loss rates which may be used to solve a long standing mystery how Venus lost its atmosphere Click Docs Earth Venus LENA 1

The low energy neutral atom imager on IMAGE allows global imaging of ion outflow exposing critical temporal information between the ionospheric outflow and prospective source mechanisms In a recent publication in J Geophys Res Khan et al 2003 performed a cross correlation analysis between density perturbations in the solar wind which impacted the magnetospheric boundary and the appearance of bursts of energetic neutrals escaping the ionosphere The analysis revealed a rapid response of 2min for the ionospheric outflow to react to the density variations and further suggested that the dominant outflow species during these events was hydrogen Additionally Khan et al 2003 were able to establish that the ion outflow was accelerated from a source region located 2 earth radii from the centre of the Earth consistent with previous suggestions of this interaction region Click Docs outflow paper with figs FINAL pdf PDF version of paper here for a PDF file of the Khan et al 2003 paper 14 April 2003 A Secondary Stream of Interstellar Neutrals images HBS accel 03b jpg Image of Quasi Parallel Heliospheric Bow Shock In a paper to be published in Advances in Space Research Collier et al

by Collier et al on the amount of dust between the Sun and the Earth based on LENA neutral solar wind observations Because the normally ionized solar wind becomes neutral when it interacts with dust as it travels from the Sun to the Earth the neutral solar wind flux measured at the Earth places strict limits on the amount of dust that can lie inside the Earth s orbit The measurements to be published in the Solar Wind 10 Conference Proceedings are consistent with determinations based on zodiacal light discovered and identified by Cassini in 1683 as resulting from sunlight scattered off
