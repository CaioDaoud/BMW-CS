Adobe GoLive 6 drought page November 2003 Drought conditions continue to persist throughout the Rocky Mountain West Extreme drought conditions remain in an almost continuous swath from the Canadian border down to Mexico In Colorado the severity of drought conditions is lessening though the entire state still exists in drier than normal conditions The South Platte River Basin is best off at only Abnormally Dry while the San Luis Valley in southern Colorado remains in extreme drought http www drought unl edu dm monitor html See the U S Drought Monitor map Forecasts for the 2003 2004 winter months are calling for drought conditions to persist for most of the state with some improvement in the mountain regions and in the South Platte Basin So far there are no indication of El Nino or La Nina conditions affecting winter weather patterns The winter months are a critical time for Colorado since 80 of the state s water accumulates with the winter snowpack http www cpc ncep noaa gov products expert assessment seasonal drought html See drought outlook Since the early spring months of 2003 when state reservoirs levels hit severely low levels Colorado made an almost miraculous rebound from the desperate drought induced plight of 2002 One major spring storm event in particular was responsible for helping to pull the state out of the most severe drought conditions Colorado has experienced since becoming a state in 1876 A weak El Nino caused enough of an increase in the state s snowpack by the end of May that many of the state s reservoir s were able to fill after forecasts had predicted that feat would take up to three years to accomplish ftp ftp wcc nrcs usda gov data snow update co txt Visit the SNOTEL update page to see what statewide snowpack conditions are Filling these important West Slope reservoirs was in part caused by a cooperative arrangement to compensate Xcel Energy to reduce its entitled use of water at its Shoshone hydrolelectric power plant in Glenwood Canyon and store the saved water in upstream reservoirs These recent drought conditions have forced all of Colorado to recognize how valuable water is in this sem arid state and reexamine how water is used especially when it is in short supply The Colorado River Water Conservation District encourages all Coloradoans to use water wisely and efficiently since it is the fuel for Western Colorado s agricultural and recreation based economy The Colorado River Water Conservation District is working hard to manage the water supplies of the West Slope to the best advantage of all of its residents In response to the prolonged period of drought the River District has Proceeded with plans for expansion of Elkhead Reservoir in Northwest Colorado Agreed to cooperatively study the possibility of contruction of a Wolcott Reservoir to provide benefits to both the West Slope and the Front Range news press 10 22 03pr pdf See release Pursue a feasibility study for expansion of Wolford Mountain Reservoir news press Wolfordenlargement11 17 03 pdf See release Arranged with Xcel Energy and Denver Water to cooperatively reduce the call at the Shoshone Power Plant in Spring 2003 to maximize the storage in upstream reservoirs West Slope benefits include ensuring a legal fill of Green Mountain Reservoir protecting West Slope against negative impacts of a call reduction and receiving a rebate of 10 of all saved waters to be returned to West Slope among others news press Shoshone Spring call reduction03 12 03 pdf See release Worked to make unused water resources on the West Slope available to water users left without a primary supply due to the drought ExxonMobil the Towns of Carbondale Rifle New Castle Basalt and the Ruedi Water and Power Authority assisted with donations of water to meet the needs of the completely water short Green Mountain Contract Pool contract holders Compensated the Redlands Water and Power Authority for not generating electricity through the 2002 2003 winter months to keep calls off of the Gunnison River and tributaries and reduce pressure on reservoirs The water required for this power generation is being stored for future use or diverted for agricultural or municipal needs Negotiated with reservoir operators and other water management groups to coordinate the releases of stored water most efficiently across the West Slope The state s limited water resources have been stretched further by reducing the pressure on certain key reservoirs and spreading this demand equitably among Western Colorado s water providers Negotiated with major water users and diverters to be flexible in their water demands keeping fewer junior water users from having their supplies cut off Worked with the partners in Green Mountain Reservoir the Northern Colorado Water Conservancy District and the Bureau of Reclamation to find solutions to the unfilled Contract Pool at Green Mountain and to the threat of earth movement at and around the Town of Heeney on Green Mountain s shores Reservoir use was restricted last summer due to the possibly of slides occuring if water levels at the reservoir became too low Arranged with Denver Water to maintain higher wintertime flows in the Fraser River by exchanging water leased from Climax Molybdenum Company and released into Dillon Reservoir and increasing flows bypassed from Denver Water s Moffat Tunnel Collection System Proposing Referendum 4A on the November 2003 ballot The referendum was defeated but it would have undertaken a series of measures in increase the West Slope s water supply for future years Passing along as much information as possible to our constituents on the West Slope of Colorado to let them understand the depths of the current water situation and enable them to most appropriately use this limited essential and very valuable resource We encourage all visitors to this page to pursue these additional drought related links for more information
