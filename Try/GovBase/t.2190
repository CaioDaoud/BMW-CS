southeastern United States The sanctuary is located 32 kilometers 17 5 nautical miles off Sapelo Island Georgia and encompasses 58 square kilometers 17 sq nautical miles of live bottom habitat location html Coastal map location of Gray s Reef 83K Significant Resources Gray s Reef is a submerged hard bottom limestone area that as compared to surrounding areas contains extensive but discontinuous rock outcropping of moderate 6 to 10 feet height with sandy flat bottomed troughs between The series of rock ledges and sand expanses has produced a complex habitat of caves burrows troughs and overhangs that provide a solid base for the abundant sessile invertebrates to attach and grow This rocky platform with its carpet of attached organisms is known locally as a live bottom habitat This topography supports an unusual assemblage of temperate and tropical marine flora and fauna Algae and invertebrates grow on the exposed rock surfaces dominant invertebrates include sponges barnacles sea fans hard coral sea stars crabs lobsters snails and shrimp The reef attracts numerous species of benthic and pelagic fish including black sea bass snapper grouper and mackerel Since Gray s Reef lies in a transition area between temperate and tropical waters reef fish population composition changes seasonally Loggerhead sea turtles a threatened species use Gray s Reef year round for foraging and resting and the reef is part of the only known winter calving ground for the highly endangered northern right whale Fossil bivalves and gastropods and mastodon bones located in this area indicate that the reef was once a shallow coastal environment and an exposed land form as recently as 10 000 years BP As a terrestrial environment there may exist at Gray s Reef extant prehistoric cultural resources Origin Of Gray s Reef Gray s Reef is a consolidation of marine and terrestrial sediments sand shell and mud which was laid down as loose aggregate between 6 and 2 million years ago Some of these sediments were probably brought down by coastal rivers draining into the Atlantic and others were brought in by currents from other areas More of these sediments accumulated until a dramatic change began to take place on Earth during the Pleistocene Epoch between 2 million and 8 000 years ago It was during this time that the area which is now Gray s Reef was exposed land and the shoreline was as much as 80 miles east of its present location As a result of this exposure the sediments there became solidified into porous limestone sandstone rock As the glacial ice melted the water flowed back towards the sea filling the basins back to their original levels profile html anchor206481 Profile of Gray s Reef Geological Cross Section profile html anchor213014 Profile of Gray s Reef Habitats anchor4707342 top Human Use and Values Gray s Reef is a popular recreational fishing and sport diving destinations along the Georgia coast Sport fishing occurs year round but at different levels of intensity Commercial fishing is restricted as are military mineral extraction and ocean dumping activities Little commercial shipping occurs at Gray s Reef While the site has supported a variety of studies it currently supports reef fish and invertebrate programs A resource characterization is in progress anchor4707342 top Site Designation and Regulations Gray s Reef was made an Active Candidate in 1979 Final designation as a National Marine Sanctuary came in January 1981 The Sanctuary was named in recognition of Milton B Gray who studied the area in the 1960 s as a biological collector and curator at the University of Georgia Marine Institute on Sapelo Island GA Regulations prohibit alteration of the seabed use of wire fish traps bottom trawls and explosives damage to or removal of bottom formations and other natural or cultural resources and discharge of substances or materials Gray s Reef enforces these regulations to promote compatible resource use through interagency agreement with the U S Coast Guard and the National Marine Fisheries Enforcement Division For more information look at the program regs html Boundaries Regulations and Permitting
