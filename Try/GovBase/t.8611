NIH Establishes Rare Diseases Clinical Research Network To address the challenges inherent in diagnosing and treating rare diseases the National Institutes of Health NIH announced today the establishment of the Rare Diseases Clinical Research Network With 51 million in grant funding over five years from several NIH components foot the network will consist of seven Rare Diseases Clinical Research Centers RDCRCs and a Data and Technology Coordinating Center DTCC Funding research on rare diseases is a vital aspect of the NIH mission said NIH Director Elias A Zerhouni M D By encouraging cooperative partnerships among the investigators at these centers we hope to accelerate the development of diagnostics and treatments that will benefit these important patients The RDCRCs and the DTCC will be located at the following institutions Baylor College of Medicine Houston TX Rare Disease Clinical Research Center for New Therapies and New Diagnostics Dr Arthur L Beaudet Boston University School of Medicine Boston MA Vasculitis Clinical Research Network Dr Peter A Merkel Children s Hospital Medical Center Cincinnati OH Rare Lung Diseases Clinical Research Network Dr Bruce C Trapnell Children s National Medical Center Washington DC Rare Diseases Clinical Research Center for Urea Cycle Disorders Dr Mark L Batshaw The Cleveland Clinic Foundation Cleveland OH Bone Marrow Failure Clinical Research Center Dr Jaroslaw P Maciejewski University of Rochester Rochester NY Nervous System Channelopathies Pathogenesis and Treatment Dr Robert C Griggs Weill Medical College of Cornell University New York NY The Natural History of Rare Genetic Steroid Disorders Dr Maria I New H Lee Moffitt Cancer Center and Research Institute University of South Florida Tampa FL The Data and Technology Coordinating Center Dr Jeffrey P Krischer Approximately 25 million people in the United States are affected by an estimated 6 000 rare diseases or conditions Diseases to be studied in the centers include urea cycle disorders Angelman s syndrome Prader Willi syndrome Rett syndrome periodic paralysis non dystrophic myotonic disorders episodic ataxia aplastic anemia paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria single lineage cytopenias including granular lymphocyte leukemia pure red cell aplasia and myelodysplastic syndromes vasculitis disorders inborn defects in steroid hormone pathways alpha 1 antitrypsin deficiency lymphangioleiomyomatosis pulmonary alveolar proteinosis and hereditary idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis Because of the small number of affected patients in any one location rare disease research requires the collaboration of scientists from multiple disciplines and the capacity to share access to geographically distributed national research resources and patient populations said Judith L Vaitukaitis M D director of the National Center for Research Resources NCRR one of the NIH funding components With a collaborative approach the network will focus on identifying biomarkers for disease risk disease severity and activity and clinical outcome while encouraging development of new approaches to the diagnosis prevention and treatment of rare diseases The network will facilitate increased collaboration and data sharing between investigators and patient support groups working to improve the lives of those affected by these diseases and potentially prevent or eliminate these diseases in the future said Stephen Groft Pharm D director of NIH s Office of Rare Diseases In addition knowledge about rare diseases may offer leads for scientific advancement in other rare diseases and in more common diseases This network supports the re engineering of the clinical research enterprise component presented recently in the Roadmap for Medical Research by Dr Zerhouni Each research center consists of a consortium of clinical investigators partnering with patient support groups and institutions within and outside of the United States that have agreed to work together studying a group of rare diseases In addition to fostering collaborative research the RDCRCs will train new investigators for the represented rare diseases and provide content for a public Web site on rare diseases research Integration of various kinds of data including genetic microarray clinical laboratory and imaging is one of the goals of this informatics approach to clinical research The RDCRCs and their sites will work with the DTCC in developing common data elements data standards and data structures The DTCC will incorporate new approaches to data sharing and federated databases at distributed sites that are scaleable or have the potential for future expansion and adaptation This approach will enable researchers to integrate data with other clinical networks such as the National Electronic Clinical Trials and Research NECTAR network Each RDCRC will utilize the resources available at the General Clinical Research Centers 82 facilities distributed across the United States that provide clinical investigators with specialized research environments and specially trained research personnel Supported by NCRR the facilities include nursing staff research subject advocates and various core technologies including sophisticated laboratories nutrition staff and imaging facilities The creation of the network responds to the Rare Disease Act of 2002 which directed NIH to support regional centers of excellence for clinical research into training in and demonstration of diagnostic prevention control and treatment methods for rare diseases The term rare or orphan disease as defined in the Orphan Drug Act is a condition affecting fewer than 200 000 in the United States or a disease with a greater prevalence but for which no reasonable expectation exists that the costs of developing or distributing a drug can be recovered from the sale of the drug in the United States The Rare Diseases Clinical Research Network is funded by the Office of Rare Diseases National Center for Research Resources National Institute of Child Health and Human Development National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases and National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases all components of NIH an agency of the Department of Health and Human Services http www nih gov NIH logo http www nih gov Home http www nih gov news News Events http list nih gov cgi bin wa SUBED1 nihpress A 1 Subscribe to receive future NIH and HHS press releases
