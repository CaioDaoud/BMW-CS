Supercomputing 2000 flyer http endo sandia gov DAKOTA licensing license html DAKOTA Version 3 1 Released April 2003 Overview Computational methods developed in structural mechanics heat transfer fluid mechanics shock physics and many other fields of engineering can be an enormous aid to understanding the complex physical systems they simulate Often it is desired to use these simulations as virtual prototypes to obtain an acceptable or optimized design for a particular system This effort seeks to enhance the utility of these computational methods by enabling their use as design tools so that simulations may be used not just for single point predictions but also for automated determination of system performance improvements throughout the product life cycle This allows analysts to address the fundamental engineering questions of foremost importance to our programs such as what is the best design how safe is it and how much confidence do I have in my answer System performance objectives can be formulated to minimize weight cost or defects to limit a critical temperature stress or vibration response or to maximize performance reliability throughput reconfigurability agility or design robustness A systematic rapid method of determining these optimal solutions will lead to better designs and improved system performance and will reduce dependence on prototypes and testing which will shorten the design cycle and reduce development costs Toward these ends a general purpose software toolkit is under continuing development for the integration of commercial and in house analysis capabilities with broad classes of systems analysis tools Written in C the http endo sandia gov DAKOTA software html DAKOTA Design Analysis Kit for Optimization and Terascale Applications toolkit is intended as a flexible extensible interface between analysis codes and iterative systems analysis methods In addition to optimization methods DAKOTA implements uncertainty quantification with sampling analytic reliability and stochastic finite element methods parameter estimation with nonlinear least squares methods and sensitivity main effects analysis with design of experiments and parameter study capabilities These capabilities may be used on their own or as components within advanced strategies such as surrogate based optimization mixed integer nonlinear programming or optimization under uncertainty By employing object oriented design to implement abstractions of the key components required for iterative systems analyses the DAKOTA toolkit provides a flexible and extensible problem solving environment as well as a platform for rapid prototyping of advanced methodologies which focus on increasing robustness and efficiency for http endo sandia gov DAKOTA research
