July 27 1999 PDF Includes Transmittal Letters Proposed Legislative Language Section by Section Analysis Final legislation passed October 1999 is shown below SPACE STATION COMMERCIAL DEVELOPMENT DEMONSTRATION PROGRAM In October 1999 Congress passed legislation signed by the President to establish a demonstration regarding the commercial feasibility and economic viability of private sector business operations involving the International Space Station and its related infrastructure This legislation is an essential component of NASA s effort to stimulate and support economic development in low Earth orbit The committee report directs NASA to establish and publish a pricing policy designed to eliminate price uncertainty for commercial use of the ISS The primary innovation in the legislation concerns the use of receipts for commercial use The legislation stipulates that any receipts collected by NASA from the commercial use of the ISS will first be used to offset any costs incurred by NASA in support of that commercial use Any receipts collected in excess of those costs may then be retained by NASA for reinvestment in the ISS economic development program Departments of
