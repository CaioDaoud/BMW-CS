notes Processing of Digitially Recorded Data BAP BAP Software and Manuals Data Types and Formats Digital data available through the USGS National Strong Motion Program Data Center are acquired from both analog and digital instruments The various types of data served from the web site include Uncorrected Acceleration Vol 1 the term uncorrected indicates that a digitized or digitally recorded time series has received no processing that involves any hypotheses as to the character or frequency content of the ground motions or recording instruments An uncorrected analog recorded time series has been corrected only for uneven film transport with time for transverse motion of the film as it moved longitudinally through the recorder and for angular tilts between the baselines of adjacent scan segments of long records Time series derived from both analog and digitally recorded data have been shifted to have zero mean and have been converted from digitization units or volts to units of cm sec sec ordinates and seconds abscissas The sampling rate for all time series data including acceleration velocity and displacement is typically 200 sec Corrected Acceleration data Vol 2 The correction process may apply baseline corrections bandpass filters removing noise contamination and instrument correction as necessary to remove the effects of frequency dependent instrument response to a time series Differences between the processing of analog and digitially recorded data are described below Software named BAP BAP that will correct the time series is also available from the NSMP web site Corrected Velocity Vol 3 For analog data and some of the digitally recorded data see below the velocity time series are derived by integrating the corrected acceleration time series For some digitally recorded data the velocity is derived by integrating the baseline corrected but unfiltered acceleration time series and then filtering the velocity see below Corrected Displacement Vol 4 For analog data and some of the digitally recorded data see below the displacement time series are derived by integrating the velocity time series For some of the digitally recorded data the displacement time series are derived by doubly integrating the baseline corrected but unfiltered acceleration time series and then filtering the displacement see below Response Spectra Vol 5 Response spectra of relative displacement relative velocity pseudo velocity and absolute acceleration are computed for damping values of 0 2 5 10 and 20 percent The periods at which response spectral values are computed range from from 0 04 sec to a long period limit that is determined by the corners of the filters applied to the corrected time series data Fourier Amplitude Spectra of Corrected Acceleration Vol 6 A

usgs gov docs smcfmt txt smcfmt txt text version Notes on the processing of digitially recorded data The NSMP is currently engaged in a program to upgrade from analog to digital instruments We have determined that the acceleration data being acquired even by these newer digital strong motion instruments are in some cases subject to small baseline instabilities often appearing as step like or transient offsets There are indications that some instabilities occur when the ground shaking from earthquakes exceeds levels as low as about 10 cm s s The cause of these offsets and their amplitude characteristics through time are not well understood at present nor can these offsets be easily identified in the acceleration records from earthquakes in order to make appropriate corrections Thus far we have found baseline instabilities to produce negligible effects typically less than about 1 cm s s in acceleration but significant long period signal distortions can be produced in velocities and displacements derived by integrating acceleration time series affected by such offsets Nonetheless experiments with a variety of processing procedures indicate that even with such baseline instabilities present response spectral values computed from unfiltered digital records are reliable to periods of at least 10 seconds In order to address these problems we have developed a new scheme for semi automated processing of the digital data Due to variations in both event triggering parameters and signal character two classes of event signals are recorded those with pre event signal and those with no pre event signal Recognizing that the constraints on initial conditions are different for these two cases two processing schemes are used as described below Constrained processing steps used for events with pre event signal particularly those with very long pre event signal of tens of seconds but also applicable to events with no pre event signal Remove a mean from the whole record where the mean is determined from t 0 to t tp the approximate onset time of the earthquake signal if tp 0 0 then the mean of the entire record is used if tp 0 no mean is removed integrate the mean corrected acceleration to velocity fit a second order polynomial to the velocity v c1 t tp c2 t tp 2 from t tp to the end of the record The function is chosen so that the fitted curve 0 0 for t tp remove the derivative of the fitted curve c1 2 c2 t tp from the mean corrected acceleration in the time interval t tp to the end of the record low cut filter the baseline corrected acceleration with a causal 4th order low cut Butterworth filter that has a corner frequency fc 0 02 Hz 50 s use BAP to integrate the baseline corrected filtered acceleration to obtain velocity and displacement to compute Fourier amplitude spectra of corrected acceleration and to compute response spectra Unconstrained processing steps events with no pre event signal Remove a mean from the whole record where the mean is determined from t 0 to the end of the record integrate the mean corrected acceleration to velocity fit a second order polynomial to the velocity v c0 c1 t c2 t2 from t 0 to the end of the record remove the derivative of the fitted curve c1 2 c2 t from the mean corrected acceleration from t 0 to the end of the record storing the initial velocity c0 in the smc file header real header 38 integrate the baseline corrected acceleration to velocity and displacement such that the initial velocity c0 and the initial displacement 0 0 low cut filter the baseline corrected acceleration velocity and displacement time series with a causal 4th order low cut Butterworth filter having a corner frequency fc 0 02 Hz use BAP to compute Fourier amplitude spectra of the baseline corrected and filtered acceleration and to compute response spectra The most significant departures of this new scheme from previous methods used by NSMP for digital data derived from analog recordings are the fitting of a quadratic instead of a linear function to velocity to obtain the baseline correction for acceleration the use of a causal instead of an acausal bi directional Butterworth filter Like the data for analog recordings the data being served from the NSMP web site for digital instruments include time series for uncorrected and corrected acceleration time series for velocity and displacement obtained by integrating the corrected acceleration bearing in mind that displacements derived by doubly integrating filtered acceleration can differ significantly from actual ground displacement Fourier amplitude spectra of corrected acceleration and response spectra for relative displacement relative velocity pseudo velocity and absolute acceleration The response spectral values for digital recordings are computed to periods as long as 15 s and damping of 0 2 5 10 and 20 percent Return to top top of page Basic Strong Motion Accelerogram Processing Software BAP The Basic Strong Motion
