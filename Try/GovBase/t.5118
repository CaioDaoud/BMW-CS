Nanomagnetodynamics Workshop in Monterey California in conjunction with the annual meeting of the Information Storage Industry Consortium INSIC INSIC is one of the industry s main forums for pre competitive research The program featured research reports from seven universities all sponsored under the NIST Nanotechnology Initiative along with research highlights from MSEL and EEEL The objective of the NIST nanomagnetodynamics program is to understand and control magnetic switching and damping especially in small structures with the aim of increasing data transfer rates during reading and writing Target bandwidths are greater than 1 gigahertz with switching times below 1 nanosecond EEEL Researchers Win Conference Best Paper and Poster Awards Kate Remley of the EEEL RF Technology Division won the Best Paper Award at the 61st Automatic RF Techniques Group ARFTG spring microwave measurement conference for the paper Phase detrending for measured multisine signals The paper was coauthored by Dylan Williams also of the RF Technology Division Dominique Schreurs Giovanni Loglio and Alessandro Cidronali Dylan Williams Jack Wang also of NIST and Uwe Arz won the Best Poster Award at the same conference for the presentation entitled StatistiCAL VNA Calibration Software This new software package was developed jointly by NIST and PTB and is significant in that it makes a decade of experience at NIST and PTB in using orthogonal distance regression for statistically based vector network analyzer calibrations directly accessible to the microwave measurement community MMW Planar Near Field Range Upgrade now Operational The new Division 813 millimeter wave MMW planar near field range is now operational The range is designed to extend measurement capability to 110 GHz Initial tests have been performed at 45 GHz on a 4 m x 4 m scan Positioning accuracy is significantly better than for the previous NIST planar range and the resulting gain data are impressive Combined with a soon to be acquired laser tracker the new MMW range will implement an analytically derived position correction theory that will additionally lower pattern uncertainties This capability will be unique to near field ranges worldwide
