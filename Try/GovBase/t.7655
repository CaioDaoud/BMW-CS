Newport News Shipbuilding Dry Dock Co 36 BRBS 21 2002 Held a claimant s work emptying trash barrels from the side of a ship under construction constitutes maritime employment as it is integral to the shipbuilding and repair process and moreover is in furtherance of the employer s compliance with a federal regulation Here the claimant was assigned to employer s Cleaning and Janitorial Department as a cleaner The first half of her shift she drove a barrel dumpster which is a machine that empties debris from 55 gallon drums She or her partner drove the dumpster to the ships sides where the dumpster would pick up the full drums and dump them into the machine The barrels contained trash and shipbuilding materials such as welding rods and strips of iron The claimant testified that the shipbuilders would fill the barrels during the course of the day and the crane would take the full barrels off the vessels and place the barrels at the ships sides In addition the claimant and her partner would drive around to other shipyard buildings and dump dumpsters This case is also noteworthy as to the Board s treatment of the Section 20 a issue The Director had argued that the ALJ should have given the claimant the benefit of the Section 20 a presumption as to jurisdiction The Board stated that it need not address the general scope of the Section 20 a presumption in coverage cases as the courts have held that the Section 20 a presumption is not applicable to the legal interpretation of the Act s coverage provision The Board then cited to several circuits that support this view However the Board neglected to point out that several circuits hold opposing views Back to Top content Back to Top Topic 1 4 Jurisdiction LHWCA v Jones Act Nunez v B B Dredging Inc 288 F 3d 271 5th Cir 2002 rehearing denied May 21 2002 Worker was not a seaman under the Jones Act even though he was permanently assigned to a dredge since he spent only approximately 10 per cent of his work time aboard the dredge The circuit court noted the Supreme Court s analysis in Chandris v Latsis resolved this issue and quoted the Supreme Court The Court stated a maritime worker who spends only a small fraction of his working time onboard a vessel is fundamentally land based and therefore not a member of the vessel s crew regardless of what his duties are The Court stated further that generally the Fifth Circuit seems to have identified an appropriate rule of thumb for the ordinary case a worker who spends less than about 30 of his time in the service of a vessel in navigation should not qualify as a seaman under the Jones Act The circuit court also said The fundamental purpose of this substantial connection requirement is to give full effect to the remedial scheme created by Congress and to separate the sea based maritime employees who are entitled to Jones Act protection from those land based workers who have only a transitory or sporadic connection to a vessel in navigation and therefore whose employment does not regularly expose them to the perils of the sea Back to Top content Back to Top Topic 1 4 1 LHWCA v Jones Act Lorimer v Great Lakes Dredge Dock Co Unpublished No 01 70849 June 3 2002 9th Cir 2002 At issue here was whether the claimant was excluded from coverage under the LHWCA because he was a seaman The Board and the Ninth Circuit found that although the claimant worked 12 hour shifts came ashore to sleep and had no seaman papers he was nevertheless a seaman The court noted that the claimant s duties as a deckhand included tying up barges alongside the dredge where he was stationed taking depth readings greasing the dredge s clamshell bucket painting cleaning and other general maintenance all of which contributed to the accomplishment of the vessel s mission of dredging in Los Angeles and Long Beach Harbors Topics 1 4 1 LHWCA v Jones Act Soloman v Blue Chip Casino Inc 772 N E 2d 515 2002 WL 1763935 Ind App July 31 2002 This is a consolidation of casino boat cases where the court of appeals court upheld the lower court s finding that the workers were not covered under the Jones Act The court of appeals held that 1 the casino boat was not located on navigable waters for purposes of the Jones Act 2 the Coast Guard s exercise of authority over the boat did not mandate finding the waters were navigable for purposes of the Jones Act and 3 a finding of being on navigable waters for purposes of the state gaming statute did not mean the boat was on navigable waters as that term is used in Jones Act jurisprudence The casino boat in question was located at Michigan City Indiana in a small man made rectangular area of water that was dug out of dry land connected to the Trail Creek a navigable body of water by a narrow and shallow opening However no commercial vessel can pass through this shallow opening that is 2 5 feet deep The court first reviewed Jones Act jurisprudence to determine that the water on which the boat floated was not navigable for purposes of the commerce clause The Daniel Ball 10 Wall 557 77 U S 557 1870 Reeves v Mobile Dredging Pumping Co 26 F 3d 1247 3d Cir 1994 A body of water is navigable if it is one that by itself or by uniting with other waterways forms a continuous highway capable of sustaining interstate or foreign commerce Next the court noted that the term navigability has at least four definitions and that what is navigable for purposes of the Coast Guard is not necessarily navigable for purposes of the commerce clause Finally the court noted that the state s definition of navigable is not co extensive with the definition under admiralty jurisdiction or the Jones Act Topic 1 4 1 LHWCA v Jones Act Generally Uzdavines v Weeks Marine Inc BRBS BRB No 02 0512 April 18 2003 In determining whether the worker had status under the LHWCA or was covered under the Jones Act the Board deferred to the ALJ s rational factual interpretation that a barge used to dredge navigational channels either pulled by a tug or moving on spuds was a vessel in navigation Thus the worker was a member of the crew covered by the Jones Act In determining that the barge was a vessel the ALJ had relied upon Bernard v Binnings Constr Co Inc 741 F 2d 824 5th Cir 1984 and Tonnesen v Yonkers Contracting Co Inc 82 F 3d 30 2d Cir 1996 In Bernard the Fifth Circuit had considered three factors in determining whether a floating work platform is a vessel 1 if the structure involved was constructed and used primarily as a work platform 2 if the structure was moored or otherwise secured at the time of the accident and 3 if the structure was capable of movement across navigable waters in the course of normal operations was this transportation merely incidental to its primary purpose of serving as a work platform In Tonnesen the Second Circuit applied the second and third Bernard factors but disagreed with regard to the first factor focus on the original purpose for the structure Instead the Second Circuit concluded that the inquiry should look to whether the structure was being used primarily as a work platform during a reasonable period of time immediately preceding the accident The Board also noted the Tonnesen court s conclusion that c ourts considering the question of whether a particular structure is a vessel in navigation typically find that the term is incapable of precise definition and that except in rare cases only the trier of facts can determine its application in the circumstances of a particular case Topic 1 4 1 LHWCA v Jones Act Becker v Tidewater Inc F 3d No 01 31420 5th Cir June 19 2003 Here the Fifth Circuit overturned a federal district court jury s finding of Jones Act seaman status After first addressing the differences between the Jones Act and the LHWCA the Fifth Circuit addressed the issue at hand namely was the plaintiff s connection to the vesse l substantial in duration and nature and therefore warranting coverage under the Jones Act It noted that in Chandris Inc v Latsis 515 U S 347 1995 Held temporary workers are not seamen although such workers may be treated as regular crew members by their peers the Supreme Court had evoked a status based standard wherein the Court rejected a voyage test The Fifth Circuit noted that while it has quantified the duration of time necessary to allow submission of the issue of seaman status to a jury by using a 30 percent rule of thumb the Supreme Court in Chandris articulated an exception to temporal guidelines such as the Fifth Circuit s 30 percent rule The Chandris exception states that i a maritime employee receives a new work assignment in which his essential duties are changed he is entitled to have the assessment of the substantiality of his vessel related work made on the basis of his activities in his new position Seaman status does not attach to a worker simply because he is necessary to the vessel s mission at the time of injury Chandris 515 U S at 358 Thus a worker who over the course of his employment has worked in the service of a vessel in navigation well under 30 percent of his time may still qualify for seaman status if he has been reassigned to a new position substantial change in status that meets this temporal requirement In applying the facts of this particular case to the law the Fifth Circuit found that the evidence was insufficient for a finder of fact to conclude that the plaintiff had proven his case Back to Top content Back to Top Topic 1 4 2 Master member of the Crew seaman Lorimer v Great Lakes Dredge Dock Co

machinery appurtenances equipment and cargo in rem 303 F 3d 1132 9th Cir 2002 The Ninth Circuit held that a seaworthy fish processing barge that is towed across navigable waters twice a year can qualify as a vessel in navigation for certain purposes of the Jones Act This barge is a documented vessel with the United States Coast Guard and has no means of self propulsion The Lucky Buck has a shaped raked bow a flat main deck a flat bottom flat sides a square raised stern and is equipped with a bilge pump It also has living quarters used by fish processors and administrators while it is moored in Alaska Pursuant to coast Guard requirements for vessels the Lucky Buck is equipped with navigational lights Other that these lights however it has no navigational equipment specifically the Lucky Buck has no rudder keel or propeller Nor is it equipped with lift rafts In Alaska it is moored by four anchors and a cable affixed to shore It floats 200 feet off shore and is accessible to land via a floating walkway It receives water from a pipe connected to the shore The court distinguished this case from Kathriner v Unisea 975 F 2d 657 9th Cir 1992 Floating fish processing plant permanently anchored to a dock and which had not moved for 7 years and had a large opening cut into its hull to allow for dock traffic was not a vessel in navigation since floating structures should not be classified as vessels in navigation if they are incapable of independent movement over water are permanently moored to land have no transportation function of any kind and have no ability to navigate The court noted that the Lucky Buck is actually sea worthy and has a transportation function carrying the fish processing plant crew quarters and incidental supplies between Seattle and Alaska twice each year Even if the transportation function of the Lucky Buck is incidental to its primary purpose of serving as a floating fish processing factory that fact does not preclude a finding that it was a vessel in navigation Additionally the court noted that the fact that it was designed to be transported among various fish processing sites raises a substantial factual issue about its status The court refused to adopt a test established by the Fifth Circuit to determine whether a work platform qualifies as a vessel in navigation See Bernard v Binnings Constr Co 741 F 2d 824 831 5th Cir 1984 Topic 1 4 3 Vessel Haire v Destiny Drilling USA Inc 36 BRBS 93 2002 Board affirmed ALJ s finding that the marshy area upon which an air boat got stuck was not navigable in fact The ALJ noted that only air boats could navigate the area and even such boats got stuck Claimant injured his back while attempting to free the air boat The Board noted that the ALJ based on the limited evidence in the record determined that only air boats could navigate the shallow bayou where claimant was injured and that the floating vegetation rendered the navigational capability of even such boats doubtful The ALJ found that this hindrance to navigation was evident from the fact that the boats were equipped with lubricants to free the vessels from the vegetation It should be noted that the Board stated Although the fact of navigational capability by air boats alone may in a given case render a waterway navigable in fact within the meaning of admiralty jurisdiction the evidence in the instant case regarding the vegetation s impediment to navigation and the lack of any other evidence of navigable capability support the ALJ s finding that claimant was not injured on navigable waters pursuant to Section 3 a of the Act Furthermore it should be noted that the marsh was separated from the main waterway by a levee Topic 1 4 3 Vessel ED NOTE The following federal district court cases are included for informational purposes only Ayers v C D General Contractors 2002 WL 31761235 237 F Supp 2d 764 W D Ky Dec 6 2002 Here the widow of a worker killed while removing supports from a dock settled the LHWCA claim but subsequently filed third party actions under the general maritime law and the Admiralty Extension Act At issue in the third party action was whether water craft exclusion excluded this claim since the worker had been working underneath a barge The court concluded that the claim should not be excluded since the barge was not used for transportation but merely aided the work under the dock Topic 1 4 3 Vessel Haire v Destiny Drilling USA Inc BRBS BRB No 02 0106 Sept 25 2002 Board affirmed ALJ s finding that the marshy area upon which an air boat got stuck was not navigable in fact

Topic 1 4 3 1 Floating Dockside Casinos Boomtown Belle Casino v Bazor 313 F 3d 300 5th Cir 2002 In denying status to the claimant the Fifth Circuit held that a floating casino is a recreational operation and thus comes within the Section 2 3 B exclusion The court found that this exclusion turns as an initial matter on the nature of the employing entity and not on the nature of the duties an employee performs The plain language of the section excludes from coverage individuals employed by a club camp recreational operation restaurant museum or retail outlet without reference to the nature of the work they do The Fifth Circuit further found that the claimant did not have situs when it stated Whether an adjoining area is a Section 3 a situs is determined by the nature of the adjoining area at the time of injury In the instant case at the time of the decedent s stroke the Boomtown facility had yet to be used for a maritime purpose Nobody had loaded or unloaded cargo and nobody had

a finding of being on navigable waters for purposes of the state gaming statute did not mean the boat was on navigable waters as that term is used in Jones Act jurisprudence The casino boat in question was located at Michigan City Indiana in a small man made rectangular area of water that was dug out of dry land connected to the Trail Creek a navigable body of water by a narrow and shallow opening However no commercial vessel can pass through this shallow opening that is 2 5 feet deep The court first reviewed Jones Act jurisprudence to determine that the water on which the boat floated was not navigable for purposes of the commerce clause The Daniel Ball 10 Wall 557 77 U S 557 1870 Reeves v Mobile Dredging Pumping Co 26 F 3d 1247 3d Cir 1994 A body of water is navigable if it is one that by itself or by uniting with other waterways forms a continuous highway capable of sustaining interstate or foreign commerce Next the court noted that the term navigability has at least four definitions and that what is navigable for purposes of the Coast Guard is not necessarily navigable for purposes of the commerce clause Finally the court noted that the state s definition of navigable is not co extensive with the definition under admiralty jurisdiction or the Jones Act Topic 1 5 2 Jurisdiction Navigable Water Weber v S C Loveland Co Weber III 35 BRBS 190 2002 Previously in Weber I 28 BRBS 321 1994 and Weber II 35 BRBS 75 2001 the Board held that a worker with status injured in the Port of Kingston Jamaica had situs and therefore was covered by the LHWCA The now insolvent employer had two insurance policies with different carriers One policy insured the employer for LHWCA coverage within the U S and the other policy insured the employer in foreign territories but did not include an LHWCA endorsement Besides the issue of jurisdiction at issue previously had been which of the two if any insurers was on the risk for longshore benefits at the time of the claimant s injury and is therefore liable for benefits Of significance in Weber III are 1 the issues of scope of authority to decide carrier issues and 2 whether the employer is entitled to Section 8 f relief In finding that it had authority to decide the matter the Board distinguished Weber III from Temporary Employment Services Inc v Trinity Marine Group Inc TESI 261 F 3d 456 35 BRBS 92 CRT 5th Cir 2001 Contractual disputes between and among insurance carriers and employers which do not involve the claimant s entitlement to benefits or which party is responsible for paying those benefits are beyond the scope of authority of the ALJ and the Board The Board noted that Weber III does not involve indemnification agreements among employers and carriers but presents a traditional issue of which of the employer s carriers is liable The Board also found that the employer was not in violation of Section 32 failure to secure LHWCA insurance coverage and thus could assert a Section 8 f claim The Director had argued that the employer was not entitled to Section 8 f relief because the employer did not have longshore coverage in Jamaica The Director cited the Board s decision in Lewis v Sunnen Crane Services Inc 34 BRBS 57 61 2000 in which the Section 8 f 2 A bar was applied to prevent an employer from obtaining Section 8 f relief due to its non compliance with Section 32 and argued that Lewis is dispositive of this issue Employer disagreed and countered that it had sufficient coverage for all work related injuries as of the date of the claimant s injury because as of that date injuries which occurred in foreign territorial waters had not been held covered under the LHWCA Accordingly the employer argued that it complied with Section 32 The Board found that Lewis was distinguishable from Weber III and therefore does not control The Board found that in Weber III the employer purchased insurance appropriate for covering the claimant s injuries under the statute and case law existing at that time It was not until the Board s decision in Weber I that an injury in the Port of Kingston was explicitly held to be compensable under the LHWCA In Weber I the Board s holding rested on cases holding that navigable waters of the United States could include the high seas Thus the Board held that Section 8 f 2 A is not applicable to the facts of this case and does not bar the employer s entitlement to Section 8 f relief Back to Top content Back to Top Topic 1 6 Jurisdiction Situs Morrissey v Kiewit Atkinson Kenny 36 BRBS 5 2002 In this jurisdiction case the claimant argued that he had jurisdiction under the LHWCA either by way of the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act OCSLA the Defense Base Act DBA or the LHWCA itself The Board upheld the ALJ s denial of jurisdiction in this matter The claimant worked on a major construction project known as the Harbor Clean up Project undertaken by the Massachusetts Water Resources Authority to build a new sewage treatment plant and a discharge or outfall tunnel to serve the Boston metropolitan area The outfall tunnel is located 400 feet beneath the ocean floor and is to extend over nine miles from Deer Island into the Atlantic Ocean The claimant worked as a member of a bull gang and his duties included maintenance of the rail system water systems and the tunnel boring machine He also was required to shovel muck a substance he described as a cement like mixture of wet dirt and debris and assisted with the changing of heads or blades on the tunnel boring machine When injured the claimant was working in the outfall tunnel approximately five miles from Deer Island The ALJ found that the claimant s work site was located in bedrock hundreds of feet below any navigable water and thus could not be viewed as being upon the navigable waters of the United States Additionally the ALJ found that the claimant was not engaged in maritime employment as his work had no connection to loading and unloading ships transportation of cargo repairing or building maritime equipment or the repair alteration or maintenance of harbor facilities Further the ALJ found that the tunnel where the injury occurred was not an enumerated situs and was not used for any maritime activities The ALJ also rejected claims for coverage under the OCSLA and DBA The Board first rejected coverage under the OCSLA noting that claimant s contentions on appeal pertain to the geographic location of the injury site more than 3 miles offshore under the seabed and erroneously disregard the statutory requirement that the claimant s injury must result from explorative and extractive operations involving natural resources Next the Board rejected coverage under the DBA The claimant had contended that the oversight provided by the United States District Court to the project is sufficient to bring the claim under the jurisdiction of the DBA However the DBA provides benefits under the LHWCA for those workers injured while engaged in employment under contracts with the United States or an agency thereof for public work to be performed outside of the continental United States The Board stated that the ALJ properly found that the DBA does not extend coverage for work on projects that must meet federal specifications guidelines and statutes but rather requires that the United States or an agency thereof be a party to the contract Finally the Board rejected coverage directly under the LHWCA The rock where the tunnel was being drilled rose above the surface of the water at the point where the claimant was injured The bedrock was at all times dry ground and there is no assertion that the tunnel itself was used in interstate commerce as a waterway Thus the Board found that the injury did not occur on navigable water As to the claimant s contention that he was injured on a marine railway the Board rejected this allegation after examining the definition of marine railway and noting that the claimant did not contend that the railway used in the tunnel played any part in removing ships from the water for repair Back to Top content Back to Top Topic 1 6 1 Jurisdiction Situs Over Water Ezell v Direct Labor Inc BRBS BRB No 00 0478 March 17 2003 In this status issue case the Board held that a claimant s travel by boat to and from his work sites on 53 percent of his days prior to his injury is sufficient to establish that his presence on navigable waters was not transient or fortuitous Here the claimant by virtue of his employment was transported by boat for 18 of the 34 days 53 percent he worked pre injury and performed more than eight percent of his total work from barges located on navigable water Most of his work was performed on a fixed platform replacing creosote boards and in pipe threading The claimant was required to regularly travel by boat 45 minutes each way to specific jobs assignments during the course of his day and as part of his overall work The claimant maintained that the Fifth Circuit in Bienvenu v Texaco 164 F 3d 901 32 BRBS 217 CRT 5th Cir 1999 en banc did not intend to exclude from coverage a worker like himself who was routinely transported to a work site over water and was injured during such transport In reaching its holding the Board distinguished this case from Brockington v Certified Electric Inc 903 F 2d 1523 11th Cir 1990 cert denied 498 U S 1026 1991 where that claimant was using water transportation to commute to his job In contrast the claimant in the instant case was already at work when required by his employer to travel by water to his work assignment He was given this assignment on a regular basis and thus his presence on the water was not merely incidental to his employment Rather claimant s presence on the boat involved a significant portion of his day and was a necessary part of his overall employment Unlike Brockington claimant was not merely commuting to work In addressing Bienvenu the Board relied on its opinion in Ezell v Direct Labor Inc 33 BRBS 19 1999 While Bienvenu rules out coverage for employees who are transiently and fortuitously on navigable water at the time of injury it does not hold that a worker injured on navigable water during the course of his employment should be denied coverage under the Act if he is regularly required by his employment to travel by boat over navigable water as well as where he performs some work on a vessel Back to Top content Back to Top Topic 1 6 2 Situs Over land Sowers v Metro Machine Corp 35 BRBS 181 2002 en banc upholding 35 BRBS 154 2001 In this en banc situs issue case the Board upheld its original panel opinion affirming the ALJ s finding that the claimant was not injured on a covered situs The claimant was injured at one of the employer s two facilities adjacent to navigable water The claimant was injured at the Mid Atlantic facility used for prefabricating steel components and painting items for Navy ships that are under repair at the employer s other facility the Imperial Docks where there are wet and dry docks Ninety five percent of the items sent to Mid Atlantic for repair or returned to the main shipyard after completion are sent over land by truck The remaining five percent are too large or too heavy to be trucked and are sent by barge The ALJ found that the Mid Atlantic facility was not a covered situs pursuant to Jonathan Corp v Brickhouse 142 F 3d 217 32 BRBS 86 CRT 4th Cir 1998 cert denied 525 U S 1040 1998 The ALJ noted that the claimant was engaged in fabrication of ship components that had to be shipped elsewhere before they were installed on the vessels and that the workers at the Mid Atlantic facility did not engage in ship repair at the water s edge and thus the work could be done at any site The fact that the large components occasionally had to be shipped by barge was deemed insufficient to cover the site under the LHWCA as this was not the customary method of transportation The Board first in a panel opinion and now en banc held that the ALJ properly applied Brickhouse Although the employer s facility was contiguous with navigable waters and thus had a geographic nexus to navigable waters the facility did not have the functional nexus with navigable waters required by the Fourth Circuit s Brickhouse decision The Board noted that this facility was used to fabricate vessel components for ships undergoing repair at the employer s other facility but this activity did not require more than the rare use of the navigable river Topic 1 6 2 Situs Over land Charles v Universal Ogden Services BRBS BRB No 02 0511 April 17 2003 Whether a warehouse could be considered an adjoining area was the primary issue in this situs determination case Here a claimant would load boxes of groceries onto a truck at his employer s warehouse adjacent to the Mississippi river in Harahan Louisiana then truck the groceries to the Mississippi Gulf Coast some 70 miles away where he would then unload the boxes into containers so that they could be taken to offshore locations While on the Gulf Coast he would empty containers of spoiled groceries from containers back onto his truck and drive the 70 miles back to his employer s warehouse location While unloading the returns at his employer s warehouse the claimant injured his back In denying coverage the Board found that there was no coverage since the claimant lacked situs The Board found that the employer s warehouse was not an adjoining area since its location had no functional relationship to the Mississippi River and was too far away from the Gulf coast docks to be considered part of that general area The facility functioned as a warehouse from which trucks not vessels were loaded Although near navigable waters neither employer s business nor surrounding properties had facilities on the water for loading unloading building or repairing vessels In reaching its decision the Board cited both Boomtown Belle Casino v Bazor 313 F 3d 300 36 BRBS 79 CRT 5th cir 2002 Whether a site is an adjoining area is determined not only by geographic proximity to navigable waters but also by the nature of the work performed there at the time of the injury and Bennett v Matson Terminals Inc 14 BRBS 526 1981 aff d sub nom Motoviloff v Director OWCP 692 F 2d 87 9th Cir 1982 Facility was not a covered situs as it was not

Situs Over land Boomtown Belle Casino v Bazor 313 F 3d 300 5th Cir 2002 In denying status to the claimant the Fifth Circuit held that a floating casino is a recreational operation and thus comes

plain language of the section excludes from coverage individuals employed by a club camp recreational operation restaurant museum or retail outlet without reference to the nature of the work they do The Fifth Circuit further found that the claimant did not have situs when it stated Whether an adjoining area is a Section 3 a situs is determined by the nature of the adjoining area at the time of injury In the instant case at the time of the decedent s stroke the Boomtown facility had yet to be used for a maritime purpose Nobody had loaded or unloaded cargo and nobody had repaired dismantled or built a vessel Topic 1 6 2 Situs Over land Bianco v Georgia Pacific Corp 304 F 3d 1053 11th Cir 2002 The Eleventh Circuit found that a worker in a sheetrock production plant did not have situs under the LHWCA Even if GPC s sheet rock production plant adjoins navigable waters it is not an area customarily used by an employer in loading unloading repairing dismantling or building a vessel The area was used solely to manufacture sheetrock Simply because maritime activity occurred in other areas of the GPC facility namely where raw gypsum was unloaded from vessels the entire GPC facility did not become an area customarily used The court reasoned Indeed were we to conclude that GPC s entire facility irrespective of what GPC does at different areas therein is an adjoining area simply because certain areas of the GPC facility engage in maritime activity we would effectively be writing out of the statue the requirement that the adjoining area be customarily used by an employer in loading unloading repairing dismantling or building a vessel Topic 1 6 2 Situs Over land Dickerson v Mississippi Phosphates Corp BRBS BRB No 02 0547 April 29 2003 In this case involving situs and status the claimant fell off of a ladder while welding in employer s phosphoric acid plant located about 100 feet from the water s edge Employer s chemical plant manufactures fertilizer and is on a navigable waterway The plant takes in phosphoric rock by vessel converts it into sulfuric acid and then phosphoric acid and the phosphoric acid is made into a fertilizer The fertilizer leaves the plant by rail truck or barge The claimant described his job as requiring him to weld pipe and operate forklifts cherry pickers and front end loaders His supervisor stated that the claimant s work required him to perform a lot of steel fabrication work some expansion work in the plant some pipefitting and foundation work for machinery The claimant conceded that he never loaded or unloaded vessels and did not maintain or repair any equipment used in the loading or unloading of a vessel For two weeks during his employment the claimant did remove wood pilings from the water s edge The Board affirmed the ALJ s finding that the piling removal work was not covered employment as there was no evidence establishing that the removing of the pilings from the water s edge was related to the loading unloading building or repairing of a vessel or to building or repairing a harbor facility used for such activity Moreover the Board found that this case was distinguishable from other cases involving covered employees working in loading operations at fertilizer plants as the claimant s work herein was not integral to the loading and unloading Thus the Board upheld the ALJ s determination that the claimant was not an employee covered under the LHWCA Turning to situs the Board determined that the ALJ had correctly found that there was not a covered situs The Board noted that for coverage one must look to the nature of the place of work at the moment of injury and that to be considered a covered situs a landward site must be either one of the sites specifically enumerated in Section 3 a or an adjoining area customarily used by an employer in loading unloading repairing dismantling or building a vessel The Board noted that an adjoining area must therefore have a maritime use It upheld the ALJ s determination that this phosphoric acid plant was solely used in the fertilizer manufacturing process and had no relation to any customary maritime activity The Board further rejected the claimant s contention that his injury occurred on a covered situs merely because employer s entire facility abuts navigable waters and has a dock area on the property The Board noted

Worker Watkins v Newport News Shipbuilding Dry Dock Co 36 BRBS 21 2002 Held a claimant s work emptying trash barrels from the side of a ship under construction constitutes maritime employment as it is integral to the shipbuilding and repair process and moreover is in furtherance of the employer s compliance with a federal regulation Here the claimant was assigned to employer s Cleaning and Janitorial Department as a cleaner The first half of her shift she drove a barrel dumpster which is a machine that empties debris from 55 gallon drums She or her partner drove the dumpster to the ships sides where the dumpster would pick up the full drums and dump them into the machine The barrels contained trash and shipbuilding materials such as welding rods and strips of iron The claimant testified that the shipbuilders would fill the barrels during the course of the day and the crane would take the full barrels off the vessels and place the barrels at the ships sides In addition the claimant and her partner would drive around to other shipyard buildings and dump dumpsters This case is also noteworthy as to the Board s treatment of the Section 20 a issue The Director had argued that the ALJ should have given the claimant the benefit of the Section 20 a presumption as to jurisdiction The Board stated that it need not address the general scope of the Section 20 a presumption in coverage cases as the courts have held that the Section 20 a presumption is not applicable to the legal interpretation of the Act s coverage provision The Board then cited to several circuits that support this view However the Board neglected to point out that several circuits hold opposing views Topic 1 7 1 Status McKenzie v Crowley American Transport Inc 36 BRBS 41 2002 Here the Board held that the case law defining maritime employment is not so broad as to include a trucker engaged in the land based movement of cargo outside of the employer s terminal to locations in a port and to the rail head nearby In other words this status case turned on determining the point at which cargo moves from the stream of maritime commerce and longshoring operations to the land based portion of its ultimate destination Specifically the claimant testified that his job duties as a truck driver at the time of his accident consisted of transporting containers and or trailers between the maritime yard at the port and the U S Customs facility also located within the port but not within the maritime yard and or the railroad yard which is located outside the port He also stated that about 5 10 percent of the time he would transport containers to areas away from the port such as to Miami The claimant stated that usually his deliveries would originate or end at a holding yard in the maritime yard although occasionally he would be required to make deliveries and or pick ups alongside the dock termed hot loads He stated that at no time did he ever board any ships as the containers at the dockside were loaded onto and unloaded from ships The manager of intermodal transportation and trucking operations concurred with the claimant s description of his work Specifically he stated that there were other drivers hired by another entity that transported cargo inside the port facility while cargo moved into or out of the port facility In reaching its decision the Board noted that the claimant s primary job duties which involved the transport of cargo between a holding yard at the port and a rail yard outside the port are not covered activities C laimant drove a truck not to move cargo as part of a loading process but to start it on its overland journey The Board also noted that the fact that the claimant may have made stops inside the port does not alter the fact that he was an overland truck driver The evidence established that on the occasions that the claimant drove to customs he continued on to his destination beyond the port Topic 1 7 1 Status Maritime Worker Maritime Employment Sumler v Newport News Shipbuilding Dry Dock Company 36 BRBS 97 2002 aff g 35 BRBS 968 ALJ 34 BRBS 213 ALJ Here the Board affirmed the ALJ s finding that the Section 2 3 status requirement was satisfied as the uncontroverted evidence of record supported his conclusion that the claimant s work changing air conditioning filters in the fabrication shops in the employer s shipyard was integral to the operation of those shops In the course of the claimant s work in the employer s air conditioning department the claimant cut delivered and helped to change air conditioning filters used in the employer s buildings throughout the shipyard The Board found it significant that the claimant delivered filters to buildings where ship construction work was being performed The air conditioning filters with which the claimant worked were used for the ventilation of the employer s shipyard buildings which were all inside the shipyard and where the ships were actually constructed Filters needed to be changed more frequently in buildings in which actual ship construction activity was performed than in other shipyard buildings The employer argued that there was no evidence to suggest that ventilation in its fabrication facilities would be impeded without the claimant to occasionally change the filters and that air conditioning itself was merely a comfort measure incidental to the shipbuilding process However the Board noted evidence that claimant s duties included the continuous changing of filters in the shipyard buildings where ship fabrication and construction was performed and that those filters where fabrication occurred were changed on a frequent basis The Board reasoned that the evidence supported the ALJ s conclusion that the claimant s work was integral As to the argument that air conditioning is merely a comfort measure the Board stated I t defies common sense to suggest that employer would have incurred the considerable expense of installing and maintaining an air conditioning system for the past fifty years if such a system were not required in order for employer to operate a competitive shipbuilding operation in the Commonwealth of Virginia Employer also argued that the claimant s duties have no traditional maritime characteristics but rather are typical of support services performed in any industrial setting However the Board noted that reliance on this reasoning regarding support services is misplaced as this rationale has previously been rejected as a test for coverage Moreover the Board in its earlier decision in this case expressly stated that the standard for coverage does not concern whether the claimant s duties were more maritime specific than those conducted in non maritime settings Next the Board rejected the employer s contention that the evidence does not establish that ventilation in the fabrication shop would be impeded without the claimant s work changing the filters in those areas It would be inconsistent with the Supreme Court s decision in Schwalb Chesapeake Ohio Ry Co v Schwalb 493 U S 40 23 BRBS 96 CRT 1989 to require claimant to demonstrate with specific evidence such as the level of particulates in the air in the shipyard fabrication shops or the frequency with which air conditioning filters require changing the effects of claimant s failure to perform her job Moreover claimant is not required to demonstrate that the effect on the air conditioning system would be immediate were she not to replace the filter rather her work is considered essential if her failure to replace the filters would eventually impede the operation of the air conditioning system As the only evidence of record supports the conclusion that the claimant s work was essential to the continued functioning of the employer s shipyard s air conditioning system and that this system was integral to the employer s shipyard operations the ALJ s finding of Section 2 3 coverage was affirmed Topics 1 7 1 Status Maritime Worker Maritime Employment Christensen v Georgia Pacific Corp 279 F 3d 807 9th Cir 2002 ED NOTE While the forum for 905 b negligence claims is federal district

BRBS BRB No 02 0535 April 24 2003 At issue in these companion cases was whether the employer was entitled to summary decision as a matter of law where the ALJs concluded that the claimants work was not integral to the shipbuilding and repair process The relevant facts concerning the claimants job duties as alleged by the employer and accepted by the ALJs are 1 the only relationship between the claimants duties and the shipbuilding process was to administer workers compensation claims for all Electric Boat employees and 2 the responsibilities of a workers compensation adjuster at Electric Boat include adjusting workers compensation claims using a new computer system setting up payment schedules organizing files and reporting to supervisors Further the motions for summary decision averred that claimant Buck did not enter the shipyard to fulfill his job duties and that Claimant Rondeau entered the shipyard four times to interview supervisors in connection with weekly safety meetings with department and yard supervisors and superintendents The claimants contend that their responsibilities resulted in injured employees being returned to the work force as soon as possible

March 5 2003 In this coverage case the employer alleges that the ALJ used an overly narrow definition of the term office to determine that the claimant was not excluded from coverage pursuant to Section 2 3 A of the LHWCA The Board noted that in Williams v Newport News Shipbuilding Dry Dock co 47 F 3d 1166 29 BRBS 75 CRT 4th Cir 1995 table vacating 28 BRBS 42 1994 the Fourth Circuit held that the ALJ failed to consider the ultimate questions whether Petitioner s duties were exclusively clerical and performed exclusively in a business office In its previous decision on reconsideration in the present case the Board agreed with the Director s position that the legislative history regarding Section 2 3 A indicated that the term office modified the term clerical and that only clerical work performed exclusively in a business office was intended to be excluded On remand the ALJ had found that while the term business office was not defined by statute or pertinent case law it was generally understood to be an enclosed or semi enclosed area which was likely to be characterized by the presence of desks chairs telephones computer terminals copy machines and perhaps book shelves The ALJ found that this contrasted with a warehouse which is a large open area where supplies are received stored and dispensed In the instant case the Board found that these determinations by the ALJ were rational The ALJ next found that the claimant s main work area in the instant case was in a warehouse and that computer work telephoning copying and other traditional business office functions would not have been performed in that area Thus the ALJ concluded that the claimant did not work exclusively in a business office The ALJ based this finding on the photographs submitted by employer claimant s affidavit and claimant s testimony at the hearing all of which he found were uncontradicted The employer contended that the claimant s work area should be characterized as a rolling business office However the Board further noted that the legislative history of Section 2 3 a reveals the intent to exclude employees who are confined physically and by function to the administrative areas of the employer s operations See 1984 U S C C A N 2734 2737 The Board noted that the ALJ considered the function of the claimant s work area and concluded that it was a warehouse floor and not a business office and found that this finding was rational and supported by substantial evidence Back to Top content Back to Top Topic 1 11 8 Exclusions Employed by a club camp recreational operation restaurant museum or retail outlet Boomtown Belle Casino v Bazor 313 F 3d 300 5th Cir 2002 In denying status to the claimant the Fifth Circuit held that a floating casino is a recreational operation and thus comes within the Section 2 3 B exclusion The court found that this exclusion turns as an initial matter on the nature of the employing entity and not on the nature of the duties an employee performs The plain language of the section excludes from coverage individuals employed by a club camp recreational operation restaurant museum or retail outlet without reference to the nature of the work they do The Fifth Circuit further found that the claimant did not have situs when it stated Whether an adjoining area is a Section 3 a situs is determined by the nature of the adjoining area at the time of injury In the instant case at the time of the decedent s stroke the Boomtown facility had yet to be used for a maritime purpose Nobody had loaded or unloaded cargo and nobody had repaired

for informational purposes only This is a claim under the Federal Employers Liability Act FELA for emotional distress damages based on the fear of contracting cancer The district court dismissed that claim because the plaintiffs made no showing of any objective manifestations of their emotional distress In upholding that dismissal the circuit court found that by requiring an objective manifestation it could avoid unpredictable and nearly infinite liability It noted that several other circuits also require objective manifestations and that this includes some that have dealt with Jones Act claims The plaintiffs had based their claims for emotional distress on Metro North Commuter R R Co v Buckley 521 U S 424 1997 Held a worker exposed to asbestos could not recover for negligently inflicted emotional distress based on his fear of contracting cancer until he exhibited symptoms of a disease The plaintiffs in Jones argued that they had exhibited symptoms of an asbestos related disease i e asbestosis However because the sole ground of CSX s motion was the plaintiffs failure to show objective manifestations of their emotional distress and because the district court granted partial summary judgment on this basis alone the circuit court did not address the question of whether Buckley permits recovery for the plaintiffs fear of contracting cancer when they have exhibited symptoms of an asbestos related disease but not of cancer specifically Topic 2 2 4 Definitions Physical Harm as an Injury ED NOTE The following FECA case is included for informational value

2002 At issue here was whether the claimant s condition was a natural progression of an original injury or the result of an aggravation or acceleration In addressing the issue the court agreed with the Board s assessment that i f the conditions of a claimant s employment cause him to become symptomatic even if no permanent harm results the claimant has sustained an injury within the meaning of the Act and that where claimant s work results in a temporary exacerbation of symptoms the employer at the time of the work events leading to this exacerbation is responsible for the resulting temporary total disability The court then cited approvingly the last responsible employer rule as applied by Kelaita v Director OWCP 799 F 2d 1308 9th Cir 1986 If on the other hand the subsequent injury aggravated accelerated or combined with claimant s prior injury thus resulting in claimant s disability then the subsequent injury is the compensable injury and the subsequent employer is responsible Lastly the court agreed with the Board that t he fact that the earlier injury was the precipitant event is not determinative The determinative question is whether the claimant s subsequent work aggravated or exacerbated the claimant s condition first manifested earlier Back to Top content Back to Top Topic 2 2 10 Employee s Intentional Conduct Willful Act of 3rd Person ED NOTE The

Concepts Norfolk Western Railway Co v Ayers U S March 10 2003 No 01 963 123 S Ct 1210 The Court held that former employees can recover damages for mental anguish caused by the genuine and serious fear of developing cancer where they had already been diagnosed with asbestosis caused by work related exposure to asbestos This adheres to the line of cases previously set in motion by the Court See Metro North Commuter R Co v Buckley 521 U S 424 1997 When the fear of cancer accompanies a physical injury pain and suffering damages may include compensation for that fear The Court noted that the railroad s expert acknowledged that asbestosis puts a worker in a heightened risk category for asbestos related lung cancer as well as the undisputed testimony of the claimants expert that some ten percent of asbestosis suffers have died of mesothelioma Thus the Court found that claimants such as these would have good cause for increased apprehension about their vulnerability The Court further noted that the claimants must still prove that their asserted cancer fears are genuine and serious ED NOTE Mesothelioma is not necessarily preceded by asbestosis Back to Top content Back to Top Topic 2 2 16 Definitions Occupational Diseases and the Responsible Employer Carrier Stevedoring Services of America v Director OWCP 297 F 3d 797 9th Cir 2002 The last employer doctrine does not contemplate merging two separate hearing loss claims into one Here the claimant had filed two separate hearing loss claims based on two separate reliable audiograms There was no dispute that the claimant s jobs at both employers were both injurious The Ninth Circuit in overruling both the ALJ and the Board noted that n o case holds that two entirely separate injuries are to be treated as one when the first one causes or is at least partially responsible for a recognized disability The Ninth Circuit explained that I t is clear that had the first claim been dealt with expeditiously the second claim would have been considered a separate injury It was only fortuitous that the case was delayed to the point that the second claim became part of the same dispute It is true that the last employer doctrine is a rule of convenience and involves a certain amount of arbitrariness However the arbitrariness does not extend to an employer being liable for a claim supported by a determinative audiogram filed previously against a separate employer that simply has not been resolved The court opined that T reating the two claims separately is supported by sound public policy principles n hearing loss cases a claimant is likely to continue working even after the onset of disability If a later audiogram is conducted something the claimant will undoubtedly undergo in the hope of getting compensated for any additional injury the first employer can simply point to the later audiogram as determinative and hand off the burden of primary liability Topic 2 2 16 Occupational Diseases and the Responsible Employer Carrier New Orleans Stevedores v Ibos 317 F 3d 480 5th Cir 2003 In this matter where the worker had mesothelioma the Fifth Circuit followed the Second Circuit s rule annunciated in Travelers Ins Co v Cardillo 225 F 2d 137 2d Cir 1955 that liability under Section 2 2 of the LHWCA rests with the last maritime employer regardless of the absence of actual causal contribution by the final exposure Employer in the instant case had argued that it could not be liable because of the worker s mesothelioma and that disease s latency period However in following Cardillo the Fifth Circuit found that a link between exposure while working for the last employer and the development of the disabling condition was not necessary The Fifth Circuit has previously held that after it is determined that an employee has made a prima facie case of entitlement to benefits under the LHWCA the burden shifts to the employer to prove either 1 that exposure to injurious stimuli did not cause the employee s occupational disease or 2 that the employee was performing work covered under the LHWCA for a subsequent employer when he was exposed to injurious stimuli Avondale Indus Inc v Director OWCP Cuevas 977 F 2d 186 190 5th Cir 1992 The Fifth Circuit also ruled that the employer was not entitled to a credit for the claimant s settlement receipts from prior maritime employers Judge Edith

35 BRBS 75 2001 the Board held that a worker with status injured in the Port of Kingston Jamaica had situs and therefore was covered by the LHWCA The now insolvent employer had two insurance policies with different carriers One policy insured the employer for LHWCA coverage within the U S and the other policy insured the employer in foreign territories but did not include an LHWCA endorsement Besides the issue of jurisdiction at issue previously had been which of the two if any insurers was on the risk for longshore benefits at the time of the claimant s injury and is therefore liable for benefits Of significance in Weber III are 1 the issues of scope of authority to decide carrier issues and 2 whether the employer is entitled to Section 8 f relief In finding that it had authority to decide the matter the Board distinguished Weber III from Temporary Employment Services Inc v Trinity Marine Group Inc TESI 261 F 3d 456 35 BRBS 92 CRT 5th Cir 2001 Contractual disputes between and among insurance carriers and employers which do not involve the claimant s entitlement to benefits or which party is responsible for paying those benefits are beyond the scope of authority of the ALJ and the Board The Board noted that Weber III does not involve indemnification agreements among employers and carriers but presents a traditional issue of which of the employer s carriers is liable The Board also found that the employer was not in violation of Section 32 failure to secure LHWCA insurance coverage and thus could assert a Section 8 f claim The Director had argued that the employer was not entitled to Section 8 f relief because the employer did not have longshore coverage in Jamaica The Director cited the Board s decision in Lewis v Sunnen Crane Services Inc 34 BRBS 57 61 2000 in which the Section 8 f 2 A bar was applied to prevent an employer from obtaining Section 8 f relief due to its non compliance with Section 32 and argued that Lewis is dispositive of this issue Employer disagreed and countered that it had sufficient coverage for all work related injuries as of the date of the claimant s injury because as of that date injuries which occurred in foreign territorial waters had not been held covered under the LHWCA Accordingly the employer argued that it complied with Section 32 The Board found that Lewis was distinguishable from Weber III and therefore does not control The Board found that in Weber III the employer purchased insurance appropriate for covering the claimant s injuries under the statute and case law existing at that time It was not until the Board s decision in Weber I that an injury in the Port of Kingston was explicitly held to be compensable under the LHWCA In Weber I the Board s holding rested on cases holding that navigable waters of the United States could include the high seas Thus the Board held that Section 8 f 2 A is not applicable to the facts of this case and does not bar the employer s entitlement to Section 8 f relief

Disability offset case is included for informational value Sanfilippo v Jo Anne B Barnhart Commissioner of Social Security 325 F 3d 391 3rd Cir 2003 At issue here is how a lump sum workers compensation settlement will offset the worker s social security disability payments Here the claimant s Social Security disability insurance benefit was reduced by his workers compensation benefit Subsequently the worker settled his workers compensation claim for a lump sum The Social Security Administration chose to offset this lump sum by continuing to make the same monthly setoffs until the lump sum amount is reached a period of 4 3 years The worker argued that the setoff of the lump sum award should have been prorated over his life expectancy 1 487 weeks The Third Circuit noted that when an individual s workers compensation benefits are paid in a lump sum the Social Security Act requires the Commissioner to prorate the lump sum payment and approximate as nearly as practicable the rate at which the award would have been paid on a monthly basis In sum we find nothing irrational about applying a periodic rate received prior to a lump sum settlement to determine the offset rate

correctly granted a borrowing employer summary judgment when a worker injured upon a vessel filed a LHWCA claim and then filed an action in the Virgin Islands Territorial trial court against the borrowing employer The Federal District Court of the Virgin Islands serves as the appellate court of the Territorial Court Prior to the filing of the trial court action OWCP had found the claimant to be covered by the LHWCA and the borrowing employer Tropical Shipping to be responsible Claimant received benefits from Tropical Shipping He then filed a negligence action against Tropical Shipping claiming he fell into a twilight zone status of uncertain LHWCA coverage The Virgin Islands Federal District Court concluded the summary judgment against the claimant was proper given the claimant s prior admissions on the issue of borrowe d employee It found that his assertions conclusively determined the issue of Tropical s employer status thereby removing any genuine dispute on that issue The court noted that T he factual basis of appellant s entire negligence claim was that he wa s working for Tropical at the time he was injured that Tropical had a duty as his employer to provide safe equipment and failed to do so in this instance by providing him with a defective ladder and that Tropical s safe ty standards were breached Additionally the assertions in the initial pleadings were consistent with Sobratti s claims to the administrative agency for the purpose of rec overing benefits under the LHWCA Throughout the administrative proceedings following his injury Sobratti continuously asserted and relied on the fact that he was an employee of Alltempts performing duties for Tropical In sum the court found that the record was replete with admissions and facts which establish that Tropical was the borrowed employer with control over the claimant s work at the time he was injured and that Tropical was protected under Section 5 of the LHWCA Topic 4 1 1 Compensation

August 1 2002 5th Cir 2002 At issue here was whether a claim filed against an employer a self insured administrator and an individual of that administrator was properly removed from state court to federal court and then ultimately dismissed by the federal district court The longshore claimant Riley asserted that Hyland a nurse employee agent of F A Richard posed as Riley s medical case manager and that Hyland while purporting to assist Riley in obtaining appropriate medical care engaged in ex parte communications with Riley s doctor According to Riley these communications caused the doctor to reverse his opinion regarding the nature and causation of Riley s back condition After contact with Hyland the doctor concluded that a natural progression of Riley s congenital spondylolisthesis caused Riley s back pain rather than the work related accident In a suit filed in Mississippi state court Riley alleged that Ingalls and FA Richard established a close working relationship with the Orthopaedic Group where numerous injured Ingalls employees are sent for treatment According to Riley this close relationship allowed Ingalls and F A Richard to exert inappropriate influence over the Orthopaedic Group s physicians so as to interfere with the medical treatment of injured Ingalls employees Specifically Riley asserted the following nine state law claims 1 intentional interference with contract 2 breach of fiduciary duty 3 intentional interference with prospective advantage 4 medical malpractice by Hyland as nurse 5 fraud and misrepresentation 6 negligence 7 intentional infliction of emotional distress 8 intentional interference with medical care and or breach of confidentiality of doctor patient privilege and 9 intentional interference with medical care by ex parte communication The Fifth Circuit found that Riley did not fraudulently join Ingalls in order to avoid federal diversity and found that Riley s claim against Ingalls was not for wages compensation benefits or bad faith refusal to pay benefits but rather was for damages that are completely independent of the employer employee relationship The court concluded that the federal district court lacked both federal question jurisdiction and diversity jurisdiction over this matter The court noted that the LHWCA is nothing more than a statutory defense to a state court cause of action and that

disability in conjunction with medical benefits surgery was timely Here the claimant s original claim for permanent disability compensation had been denied as the employer had established the availability of suitable alternate employment which the claimant could perform at wages equal to or greater than his AWW Additionally it should be noted that the claimant was not awarded nominal benefits Several years later when the claimant underwent disc surgery the Employer denied a request for temporary total disability The Board did not accept claimant s argument that Section 13

Treatment Necessary Treatment Weikert v Universal Maritime Service Corp 36 BRBS 38 2002 The requirements of Section 8 of the LHWCA do not apply to a claim for medical benefits under Section 7 of the LHWCA The Board held that a claimant need not have a minimum level of hearing loss i e a ratable loss pursuant to the AMA Guides to be entitled to medical benefits The Board also reject the employer s assertion that this case was controlled by Metro North commuter Railroad v Buckley 521 U S 424 1997 Buckley involved a railroad employee who had been exposed to asbestos and sought to recover under the Federal Employers Liability Act 45 U S C 51 et seq FELA medical monitoring costs he may incur as a result of his exposure Because Buckley had not been diagnosed with any asbestos related disease and was not experiencing any symptoms the Supreme Court held that he was not entitled to medical monitoring Besides coming under another act the Board specifically noted that in the instant longshore case the ALJ specifically found that the claimant has trouble hearing and distinguishing sounds and thus has symptoms of hearing loss Next the Board addressed the ALJ s delegation to the district director the issue as to whether hearing aids were a necessity in this matter While noting that there are several instances where the district director has authority over certain medical matters the Board stated that it has declined to interpret the provisions of Section 7 b of the LHWCA or Section 702 407 of the regulations in such a manner as to exclude the ALJ from the administrative process when questions of fact are raised Thus the Board found the issue of whether treatment is necessary and reasonable where the parties disagree is a question of fact for the ALJ The Board also stated that Contrary to employer s contention the absence of a prescription for hearing aids from a medical doctor as required by Virginia law does not make claimant ineligible for hearing aids or medical benefits under the LHWCA While claimant must comply with specific provisions under Virginia law before he is able to obtain hearing aids claimant s compliance or non compliance with state requirements does not affect the authority of the ALJ to adjudicate claimant s entitlement to medical benefits under the LHWCA Topic 7 3 1 Medical Treatment Necessary Treatment ED NOTE The following is for

This remand involved both a traumatic as well as psychological injury Although finding the claimant to be entitled to total disability benefits the ALJ ordered the benefits suspended pursuant to Section 7 d 4 on the ground that the claimant unreasonably refused to submit to medical treatment i e an examination which the ALJ ordered and the employer scheduled The Board noted that Section 7 d 4 requires a dual inquiry Initially the burden of proof is on the employer to establish that the claimant s refusal to undergo a medical examination is unreasonable if carried the burden shifts to the claimant to establish that circumstances justified the refusal For purposes of this test reasonableness of refusal has been defined by the Board as an objective inquiry while justification has been defined as a subjective inquiry focusing narrowly on the individual claimant Here the Board supported the ALJ s finding that the claimant s refusal to undergo an evaluation was unreasonable and unjustified citing the pro se claimant s erroneous belief that he has the right to determine the alleged independence and choice of any physician the employer chooses to conduct its examination or can refuse to undergo the examination because the employer did not present him with a list of doctors in a timely manner and the claimant s abuse of the ALJ by yelling and insulting the integrity of other parties The Board described the telephone conference the ALJ had with the parties as contentious The Board held that the ALJ did not abuse his discretion by finding that the claimant s refusal to undergo the employer s scheduled examination was unreasonable and unjustified given the circumstances of this case However the Board noted that compensation cannot be suspended retroactively and thus the ALJ was ordered to make a finding as to when the claimant refused to undergo the examination The Board further upheld the ALJ s denial of the claimant s request for reimbursement for expenses related to his treatment for pain management The ALJ rejected the claimant s evidence in support of his request for reimbursement for pain management treatment pursuant to 29 C F R 18 6 d That section provides that where a party fails to comply with an order of the ALJ the ALJ for the purpose of permitting resolution of the relevant issues may take such action thereto as is just including iii Rule that the non complying party may not introduce into evidence documents or other evidence in support of any claim v Rule that a decision of the proceeding be rendered against the non complying party In a footnote the Board noted that medical benefits cannot be denied under Section 7 d 4 for any other reason than to undergo an examination However the Board went on to note The Act also provides for imposition of sanctions for failure to comply with an order Under Section 27 b the ALJ may certify the facts to a district court if a person resists any lawful order 33 U S C 927 b As these provisions are not inconsistent with the regulation at 29 C F R 18 6 d 2 the ALJ did not err in applying it in this case Back to Top content Back to Top TOPIC 8 1 No new cases for this Supplement Back to Top

case it is nevertheless noteworthy for LHWCA purposes In this case the Court sets a new rebutable presumption standard that an accommodation requested by a disabled employee under the ADA is unreasonable if it conflicts with seniority rules for job assignments This was a 5 4 decision by J Breyer with two concurrences J Stevens and J O Connor and two dissents J Scalia with J Thomas joining and J Souter with J Ginsburg joining U S Airways Inc v Barnett 535 U S 391 122 S Ct 1516 2002 Held an employer s showing that a requested accommodation conflicts with seniority rules is ordinarily sufficient to show as a matter of law that an accommodation is not reasonable However the employee remains free to present evidence of special circumstances that makes a seniority rule exception reasonable in the particular case The Court took a middle ground here rejecting both the positions of the airline and its employee The airline had argued that a proposed accommodation that conflicts with an employer established seniority system should be automatically unreasonable The employee had argued that the employer should have the burden to show the accommodation s conflict with seniority rules constitutes an undue hardship Justice Breyer noted that various courts have properly reconciled reasonable accommodation and undue hardship in a practical way that does not create a dilemma for employees The justice explained that those courts have held that an employee need only show that an accommodation seems reasonable on its face i e ordinarily or in the run of cases while the employer then must show special typically case specific circumstances that demonstrate undue hardship in the particular circumstances He went on to state that the the seniority system will prevail in the run of cases because the typical seniority system provides important employee benefits by creating and fulfilling employee expectations of fair uniform treatment Topic 8 2 3 1 Extent of Disability Total

that poses a direct threat to the worker s own health or safety that the ADA does not protect such a worker Here the employer refused to hire the applicant to work at an oil refinery because company doctors opined that the applicant s hepatitis C would be aggravated by the toxins at the workplace The applicant had unsuccessfully argued that he should be able to decide for himself whether to take the risk of working in an oil refinery where chemicals might aggravate his liver ailment Since the applicant disputed the doctors assessment the Supreme Court stated that on remand the Ninth Circuit could consider whether the employer engaged in the type of individualized medical assessment required by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission regulation Topic 8 2 3 1 Extent of Disability Total disability while working Extraordinary Effort Newport News Shipbuilding Dry Dock Co v Vinson Unpublished 4th Cir No 00 1204 June 20 2002 Here the employer challenged the ALJ s finding that the claimant was entitled to disability benefits for the period during which he returned to his employment as a welder despite his injury In upholding the ALJ and the Board the Fourth Circuit noted that the claimant s return to work after his injury did not preclude a disability award as a matter of law The statutory standard for disability turns on the claimant s capacity for work not actual employment Thus when a claimant as here continues employment after an injury only through extraordinary effort to keep working and despite the attendant excruciating pain and substantial risk of further injury he may nevertheless qualify for a disability award The court noted that a disability award under the LHWCA is predicated on an employee s diminished capacity for work due to injury rather than actual wage loss Topic 8 2 3 1 Extent of Disability Total disability while working Beneficent employer sheltered employment and extraordinary effort Ward v Holt Cargo Systems Unreported

Shipbuilding Dry Dock v Director OWCP Brickhouse 315 F 3d 286 4th Cir 2002 Here the Fourth Circuit adopted the Fifth Circuit s rationale in Abbott v Louisiana Insurance Guaranty Assoc 27 BRBS 192 1993 aff d 40 F 3d 122 5th Cir 1994 that suitable alternate employment is reasonably unavailable due to the claimant s participation in an approved rehabilitation program even though the employer s offer of alternate employment would have resulted in an immediate increase in wage earning capacity In the instant case after OWCP approved a vocational rehab program for the claimant and placed a two year completion timetable on it Newport News sought to hire the claimant in a newly created desk position At the time of the offer the claimant lacked completing the program by two classes and it was doubtful as to whether he could enroll in night school to timely complete the program Additionally the job offer from Newport News came with the condition that the claimant could be terminated with or without notice at any time at the option of the Company or yourself Topic 8 2 3 2 Disability While Undergoing Vocational Rehabilitation Castro v General Construction Company BRBS BRB No 02 0783 May 13

program and that Abbott v Louisiana Insurance Guaranty Ass n 27 BRBS 192 1993 aff d 40 F 3d 122 29 BRBS 22 CRT 5 th cir 1994 Although claimant could physically perform the jobs identified by the employer s expert he could not re alistically secure any of them because his participation in the rehab program prevented him from working The Board noted that it has consistently applied Abbott both inside and outside the Fifth Circuit and that the Fourth Circuit recently came to a similar conclusion in Newport News Shipbuilding Dry Dock Co v Director OWCP Brickhouse 315 F 3d 286 36 BRBS 85 CRT 4th Cir 2002 ALJ was entitled to conclude it was unreasonable for the employer to compel claimant to choose between the job and completing his training In the instant case the employer challenged the application of Abbott on the grounds that there is no specific provision in the LHWCA allowing for an award of total disability benefits merely because a claimant is participating in a vocational rehabilitation program The Board found that Abbott rest not on any novel legal concept but on the well established principle that once a claimant established a prima facie case of total disability the employer bears the burden of demonstrating the availability of suitable alternate employment If the employer makes this showing the claimant may nevertheless be entitled to total disability if he shows he was unable to secure employment although he diligently tried The decision in Abbott preserves these principles in the context of enrollment in a vocational rehabilitation program which precludes employment Additionally the Board noted that while Congress enacted a statute that dealt with total a nd part ial disability it was left to the courts to develop criteria for demonstrating these concepts and the tests created establish that the degree of disability is measured by considering economic factors in addition to an injured employee s physical condition The Employer here also argued that its due process rights were violated when it was not given a hearing on the question of whether the claimant was entitled to vocational rehabilitation Back to Top content Back to Top Topic

Suitable alternate employment location of jobs Patterson v Omniplex World Services BRBS BRB No 02 0332 Jan 21 2003 This Defense Base Act case has issues concerning the admission of evidence and the scope of the relevant labor market for suitable employment purposes Here the claimant from Missouri was injured while employed as a security guard in Moscow as an embassy construction site He had previously worked for this same employer for approximately six years before this injury in various locations After the close of the record in this matter the employer requested that the record be reopened for the submission of new and material evidence which became available only after the close of the record Specifically the employer asserted that in a state court filing dated subsequent to the LHWCA record closing the claimant stated that he had previously been offered and had accepted a security guard job in Tanzania The claimant argued that this evidence should not be admitted as it was outside the relevent Trenton Missouria labor market The ALJ issued an Order Denying Motion to Reopen Record stating that his decision would be based upon the existing record due to the fact that the record was complete as of the date of the hearing together with the permitted post hearing submissions the complexity of the matters being raised post hearing the delays that would be encountered if further evidence is admitted and the provisions of Section 22 of the Act which provide for modification of the award if any In overturning the ALJ on this issue the Board found the evidence to be relevant and material and not readily available prior to the closing of the record The evidence was found to be properly admissible under Section 18 54 c of the general rules of practice for the Office of Administrative Law Judges as well as under the specific regulations applicable to proceedings under the Act 20 C F R 702 338 702 339 See generally Wayland v Moore Dry Dock 21 BRBS 177 1988

order to receive newly discovered relevant and material evidence While the Board affirmed the ALJ s conclusion that Missouri is the claimant s permanent residence and thus his local labor market in the case the Board opined that the ALJ should have considered the significance of the claimant s overseas employment in evaluating the relevant labor market The Board concluded that given the claimant s employment history the labor market cannot be limited solely to the Trenton Missouri area Additionally the Board noted that in fact the claimant has continued to perform post injury security guard

Applicability and Purpose of Section 8 f Weber v S C Loveland Co Weber III 35 BRBS 190 2002 Previously in Weber I 28 BRBS 321 1994 and Weber II 35 BRBS 75 2001 the Board held that a worker with status injured in the Port of Kingston Jamaica had situs and therefore was covered by the LHWCA The now insolvent employer had two insurance policies with different carriers One policy insured the employer for LHWCA coverage within the U S and the other policy insured the employer in foreign territories but did not include an LHWCA endorsement Besides the issue of jurisdiction at issue previously had been which of the two if any insurers was on the risk for longshore benefits at the time of the claimant s injury and is therefore liable for benefits Of significance in Weber III are 1 the issues of scope of authority to decide carrier issues and 2 whether the employer is entitled to Section 8 f relief In finding that it had authority to decide the matter the Board distinguished Weber III from Temporary Employment Services Inc v Trinity Marine Group Inc TESI 261 F 3d 456 35 BRBS 92 CRT 5th Cir 2001 Contractual disputes between and among insurance carriers and employers which do not involve the claimant s entitlement to benefits or which party is responsible for paying those benefits are beyond the scope of authority of the ALJ and the Board The Board noted that Weber III does not involve indemnification agreements among employers and carriers but presents a traditional issue of which of the employer s carriers is liable The Board also found that the employer was not in violation of Section 32 failure to secure LHWCA insurance coverage and thus could assert a Section 8 f claim The Director had argued that the employer was not entitled to Section 8 f relief because the employer did not have longshore coverage in Jamaica The Director cited the Board s decision in Lewis v Sunnen Crane Services Inc 34 BRBS 57 61 2000 in which the Section 8 f 2 A bar was applied to prevent an employer from obtaining Section 8 f relief due to its non compliance with Section 32 and argued that Lewis is dispositive of this issue Employer disagreed and countered that it had sufficient coverage for all work related injuries as of the date of the claimant s injury because as of that date injuries which occurred in foreign territorial waters had not been held covered under the LHWCA Accordingly the employer argued that it complied with Section 32 The Board found that Lewis was distinguishable from Weber III and therefore does not control The Board found that in Weber III the employer purchased insurance appropriate for covering the claimant s injuries under the statute and case law existing at that time It was not until the Board s decision in Weber I that an injury in the Port of Kingston was explicitly held to be compensable under the LHWCA In Weber I the Board s holding rested on cases holding that navigable waters of the United States could include the high seas Thus the Board held that Section 8 f 2 A is not applicable to the facts of this case and does not bar the employer s entitlement to Section 8 f relief Back to Top content Back to Top Topic 8

434 4th Cir 2003 Newport News Shipbuilding Dry Dock Co v Cherry 326 F 3d 434 4th Cir 2003 In these Section 8 f claims the employer failed to satisfy the contribution element and therefore the employer was not entitled to Section 8 f relief In Ward the Fourth Circuit defined the contribution element of Section 8 f criteria as follows Third the employer must affirmatively establish that the ultimate permanent partial disability materially and substantially exceeded the disability that would have resulted from the work related injury alone in the absence of the pre existing condition The Fourth Circuit noted that an employer can satisfy the contribution element only if it can quantify the type and extent of disability the employee would have suffered absent the pre existing disability In other words an employer must present evidence of the type and extent of disability that the claimant would suffer if not previously disabled when injured by the same work related injury The quantification aspect of the contribution element provides an ALJ with a basis on which to determine whether the ultimate permanent partial disability is materially and substantially greater than the disability the employee would have suffered from the second injury alone Citing Director OWCP v Newport News Shipbuilding and Dry Dock Co Harcum 8 F 3d 175 at 185 86 4th Cir 1993 aff d on other grounds 514 U S 122 1995 The court noted Importantly in assessing whether the contribution element has been met an ALJ may not merely credulously accept the assertions of the parties or their representatives but must examine the logic of their conclusions and evaluate the evidence upon which their conclusions are based Citing Direcotr OWCP v Newport News Shipbuilding and Dry Dock Co Carmines 138 F 3d 134 at 140 4th Cir 1998 In Ward the doctor s assertions were generalized and his overall conclusions lacked any supporting explanation The court found that in particular his statement that the claimant would have been able to return to light duty Shipyard work if he had suffered only one of his back injuries is conclusory and lacks evidentiary support Simply noting that an earlier injury rates a minimum 5 permanent disability rating under the AMA Guides fails to assess the level of the claimant s disability that would have resulted from the later injury alone In Winn the Fourth Circuit again found that merely subtracting the extent of disability from the extent of the current disability is legally insufficient under Carmines to establish that a claimant s preexisting disability is materially and substantially greater than the disability due to the final injury alone The Fourth Circuit took a similar tact in Cherry Also the Fourth Circuit noted that another medical opinion which merely states that if the claimant had not been a smoker his disability would have been much less is also legally insufficient since this opinion does not attempt to quantify the level of impairment that would result from the work related injury alone as is required by Harcum In Ponders the Fourth Circuit noted that the competing policy goals problem of Section 8 f is exacerbated by the fact that the adversarial system breaks down to a degree with regard to Section 8 f claims The court noted that The evidentiary hearing in such cases may involve only the employer and the claimant It is only after the initial hearing is concluded that the Director the person with the interest in protecting the integrity of the special fund enters the picture The record made at the original hearing may as a consequence be tilted in favor of Section 8 f relief In Ponders the court acknowledged the difficulty which confronts a doctor called upon to make the assessment required by Carmines in a case involving successive lung diseases The difficulty of making the assessment in isolated cases however does not compel us to adopt a different rule n 2 Back to Top content

responsible for the claimant s attorney fee at the Board level The employer did not participate in the Director s appeal before the Board and the claimant argued in response to the Director s appeal for the employer s continued exclusion from the case The Board found that such an employer is not liable for an attorney fee Furthermore the Board found that The fact that employer had an economic interest in the outcome due to the increased assessment under Section 44 is not sufficient for employer to be held for claimant s attorney s fee for work performed before the Board under the facts of this case Thus the Board found that since the claimant s attorney obtained an award of permanent total disability an attorney s fee for his counsel can be made a lien on the claimant s compensation

injury average weekly wages he is not entitled to benefits under the LHWCA Specifically the court held that an employee is not entitled to a loss of earnings capacity benefits where his actual post injury earnings adjusted for inflation exceeded his pre injury wages absent evidence that the employee s actual post injury earnings did not fairly represent employee s earnings capacity in his injured condition Here the employee contended that he had lost wage earning capacity within the meaning of the LHWCA to the extent that he could not earn what he would have been able to earn absent his injury and that he should have been awarded benefits equal to two thirds of that loss His contention is that but for his industrial accident he would be earning about 134 000 annually as a crane operator about 25 000 more than his current annual earnings of about 109 000 as a marine clerk This contention rests in part on the factual assumption that absent his back injury he would be able to obtain certification as a crane operator and to find sufficient work in that job to earn about 134 000 The court also noted that his contention additionally rests in part on a legal assumption that compensation under the LHWCA is based on the method of calculation employed for ordinary torts Assuming that claimant s factual contentions were correct the court found his legal conclusions to be wrong Benefits under the Act are not calculated in the same way as compensation under the tort system The Act provides benefits based on disability which is defined as incapacity because of injury to earn the wages which the employee was receiving at the time of injury in the same or any other employment That is disability is not defined as it would be under the tort system as the inability to earn hypothetical future wages that the worker could have earned if he had not been injured Rather disability is defined under the Act as the difference between the employee s pre injury average weekly wages and his post injury wage earning capacity The claimant additionally argued that the proviso of Section 8 h instructs the ALJ to allow benefits equal to the difference between his actual earnings and the wage earning capacity he would have had if he had not been injured However the Ninth Circuit found that this argument is based on a misreading of Section 8 h and that the section including its proviso is designed only to specify the method by which to determine post injury wage earning capacity within the meaning of the LHWCA Once wage earning capacity is determined 908 c 21 instructs the ALJ to compare wage earning capacity with pre injury average weekly wages to determine the level of benefits according to the court Back to Top content Back to Top Topic 8 9 1 Wage earning Capacity Generally Longshore 20HTML 09 Johnston v Director OWCP 280 F 3d 1272 9th Cir 2002 In this case interpreting Section 8 c 21 the court considered whether in a situation where actual wages have remained constant a claimant s post injury earnings must be adjusted for inflation in order to be considered on equal footing with wages at the time of injury The Ninth Circuit held that the actual wages without adjustments for inflation fairly and reasonably represent the claimant s wage earning capacity as required by Section 8 h The court agreed with the Board that the fact that the wages claimant earned in his post injury job may not have kept pace with inflation is not due in any part to claimant s injury Here the claimant had resumed the same job he had prior to the injury albeit in a part time capacity As a result of a collective bargaining agreement claimant s wage rate as a dock supervisor remained unchanged between the time of his injury and the period during which he worked part time Back to Top content Back to Top Topic 8 9 2 Wage Earning Capacity Factors for Calculation Ward v Holt Cargo Systems Unreported BRB No 01 0649 May 6 2002 In instances where a claimant s pain and limitations do not rise to the level of working only with extraordinary effort and in spite of excruciating pain such factors nonetheless are relevant in determining a claimant s post injury wage earning capacity and may support an award of permanent partial disability benefits under Section 8 c 21 based on a reduced earning capacity despite the fact that a claimant s actual earnings may have increased Back to Top content Back to Top TOPIC 8 10 Topic 8 10 1 Settlements Generally Jeschke v Jones Stevedoring Co BRBS BRB No 01 0553 March 21 2002 Here the claimant was prescribed bi neural analog hearing aids and began wearing completely in the canal hearing aids to reduce wind noise Subsequently he filed a hearing loss claim against two employers and entered into a Section 8 i settlement with one who accepted responsibility and agreed to be responsible for all future medical expenses Sometime after the district director issued a compensation order approving the settlement which she stated effected a final disposition of the claim After that the claimant obtained state of the art digital hearing aids The Board found that the ALJ was within reason in finding that the responsible employer who had settled this claim was liable for the new hearing aids as the settlement had indicated it would remain liable for all future reasonable and necessary medical expenses for treatment of the claimant s work related hearing loss The ALJ had determined that this was a work related hearing loss and that this employer had accepted liability in the settlement

Topic 8 10 4 Settlements Time Frame Jenkins v Puerto Rico Marine Inc 36 BRBS 1 2002 Here the claimant argues that the district director erred in denying his request for penalties and interest on Section 8 i settlement proceeds When the district director received the parties application for settlement the case was on appeal before the Eleventh Circuit and thus the district director did not have jurisdiction He therefore concluded that the 30 day time limit for automatic approval of the settlement was tolled and instructed the parties to request remand of the case so that he could fully consider the agreement The crux of the claimant s contention is that contrary to the district director s findings the 30 day time limit for consideration of the settlement could not be tolled and therefore the settlement was automatically approved and as a result the employer was liable for interest and penalties which accrued from the date of the 30th day until payment to the claimant of the agreed upon amounts Citing Section 702 241 b 20 C F R 702 241 d The thirty day period as described in paragraph f of this section begins when the remanded case is received by the adjudicator the Board held that the 30 day period had properly been tolled The Board further noted that the 30 day period would have been tolled in any event since the parties had not provided a complete application as needed to comply with Section 702 242 of the regulations Claimant also alleged that in approving the settlement the district director in effect nullified the Board s prior attorney fee award and that award should be considered separate and apart from the attorney s fee agreed upon in the parties settlement agreement However based on the wording in the settlement agreement the Board found that the

Approving Settlement and the Order Denying Motion to Reconsider Approval of Settlement Prior to the submission of the settlement agreement to the claimant and his counsel the employer received a rumor that the claimant was being considered for longshore employment The employer subsequently contacted the claimant s counsel who after consulting with the claimant informed the employer that the claimant might return to longshore employment upon a release from his physician The claimant did return to longshore employment on March 25 2002 as a wharf gang member The settlement agreement was thereafter faxed to the claimant s counsel was signed and returned to employer The employer s Human Resources Department was unable to verify the claimant s employment status Subsequently the employer s two carriers executed the settlement agreement and forwarded it along with the appropriate attachments to the ALJ who issued an Order approving the executed settlement agreement on April 23 2002 Later the employer asserted that it became aware on April 25 2002 of the claimant s re employment and on April 26 2002 filed a Motion to Disapprove Settlement Agreement and or to Reconsider Approval of Settlement The ALJ denied relief On appeal the employer challenged the ALJ s approval of the parties executed settlement agreement asserting that the settlement should be set aside as the claimant returned to longshore employment in violation of a term of the agreement However as the Board pointed out the parties settlement agreement addresses only the remedy available to the employer should the claimant return to work as a laborer in the longshore industry after the settlement is approved and the remedy it provides is not rescission of the agreement but a credit to be applied to any future claim for benefits The Board noted that Contrary to employer s position on appeal the presence of an express right of rescission in a settlement agreement is required in order for employer to protect its interest should a specific contingency arise The settlement agreement in this case however does not specifically provide employer with a right of rescission should some specific event occur prior to approval by the ALJ Citing Oceanic Butler Inc v Nordahl 842 F 2d 773 21 BRBS 33 CRT 5th Cir 1988 aff g 20 BRBS 18 1987 The Board further stated Accordingly as the executed settlement agreement sets forth no express right of rescission for employer and contains no express provision allowing employer to escape from its agreement to pay if claimant were to return to work we reject employer s contention that the ALJ erred in not setting aside the agreement However the reader is cautioned that this last statement by the Board may be somewhat misleading Nordahl which the Board repeatedly cited as authority in this area of the law specifically addressed an employer s ability to include a provision allowing its escape from an agreement during the pre approval period not post approval The Board even notes this distinction in its footnote 6 There is no case law which holds that the parties can contract to rescind a settlement agreement if an event occurs after the settlement has become effective Employer also argued that the claimant s return to work was a material breach of the agreement since he represented that he could not return to work as a laborer However the Board noted that the agreement provided additional reasons for settlement Furthermore the Board noted that the claimant returned to work as a member of a wharf gang not as a laborer and the employer knew of the claimant s intention to return to work prior to its execution of the agreement Finally employer s argument that claimant s return to work denied it the benefit of the bargain is misplaced since as noted by the Fifth Circuit in Nordahl settlements are essentially a gamble claimants gamble inter alia that the injury will not be as debilitating as the carrier expects while the carrier gambles inter alia that claimant will have less earning capacity on the open labor market than they expect or that claimant has applied an overly optimistic discount rate in evaluating his future rights Topic 8 10 6 Withdrawal of Claim Settlement Agreement Rogers v Hawaii Stevedores Inc BRBS BRB No 02 0816 April 10 2003 In an issue of first impression the Board held that a claimant may withdraw from a settlement agreement prior to its approval Citing Oceanic Butler Inc v Nordahl 842 F 2d 773 21 BRBS 33 CRT 5th Cir 1988 the Board noted that while the LHWCA and the regulations do not explicitly state that the claimant may rescind a settlement agreement prior to its approval the reasoning of the Fifth Circuit in Nordahl that a claimant has such a right is compelling The holding that a claimant s agreement to waive his compensation is not binding upon him unless it is administratively approved either through the settlement process or pursuant to a withdrawal under Section 702 225 is supported by the structure of the Act Consistent with Sections 15 b and 16 no agreement by a claimant to waive or compromise his right to compensation is valid until it is administratively approved pursuant to Section 8 i Thus claimant may withdraw his agreement at any time prior to approval of the agreement by the ALJ Back to Top content Back to Top Topic 8 10 7 Settlements Attorney

Concepts Weikert v Universal Maritime Service Corp 36 BRBS 38 2002 The requirements of Section 8 of the LHWCA do not apply to a claim for medical benefits under Section 7 of the LHWCA The Board held that a claimant need not have a minimum level of hearing loss i e a ratable loss pursuant to the AMA Guides to be entitled to medical benefits The Board also reject the employer s assertion that this case was controlled by Metro North commuter Railroad v Buckley 521 U S 424 1997 Buckley involved a railroad employee who had been exposed to asbestos and sought to recover under the Federal Employers Liability Act 45 U S C 51 et seq FELA medical monitoring costs he may incur as a result of his exposure Because Buckley had not been diagnosed with any asbestos related disease and was not experiencing any symptoms the Supreme Court held that he was not entitled to medical monitoring Besides coming under another act the Board specifically noted that in the instant longshore case the ALJ specifically found that the claimant has trouble hearing and distinguishing sounds and thus has symptoms of hearing loss Next the Board addressed the ALJ s delegation to the district director the issue as to whether hearing aids were a necessity in this matter While noting that there are several instances where the district director has authority over certain medical matters the Board stated that it has declined to interpret the provisions of Section 7 b of the LHWCA or Section 702 407 of the regulations in such a manner as to exclude the ALJ from the administrative process when questions of fact are raised Thus the Board found the issue of whether treatment is necessary and reasonable where the parties disagree is a question of fact for the ALJ The Board also stated that Contrary to employer s contention the absence of a prescription for hearing aids from a medical doctor as required by Virginia law does not make claimant ineligible for hearing aids or medical benefits under the LHWCA While claimant must comply with specific provisions under Virginia law before he is able to obtain hearing aids claimant s compliance or non compliance with state requirements does not affect
