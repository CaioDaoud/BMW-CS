locations in the basin were obtained from the USGS photo archive in Denver CO Repeat photography was done by Scott Aby in 1998 We welcome any contributions to this historic archive Erosion Rates and Sediment Monitoring One cannot talk about the Rio Puerco without talking about sediment The USGS in conjunction with other federal and state agencies and Universities has established methods and sites for monitoring sediment yields in the Puerco Allen Gellis has summarized the erosion streamflow html history of gaging and sediment collection and is developing a sediment budget for the Rio Puerco Gaging of the main stem and tributaries such as erosion yields html Arroyo Chavez allows for comparison of sediment yields over various spatial and temporal scales Cosmogenic isotopes 10Be and 26Al provide evidence for upland erosion rates and residence time of sediment in temporary storage on hillslopes and low order stream alluvium Sampling and analysis are being conducted by http geology uvm

over the past 30 000 years Within that time intervals as short as a few hundred years such as the Medieval Warm Period and Little Ice Age can be distinguished Tree ring records provide a 2000 year record of rainfall cycles for the western part of the basin Records from the El Malpais National Monument have been studied recently by http www valdosta edu grissino personal htm Henri Grissino Mayer archeo Archeological Sites Over ten thousand archeo archeological sites are known to exist in the Rio Puerco Basin ranging in age from paleoindian 9 500 to 9 000 BC to 19th and 20th century historic
