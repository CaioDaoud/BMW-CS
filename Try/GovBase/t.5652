to the surface and ultimately is ejected upon release of gas pressure With precise instruments and refined data analysis it is now possible to track the subsurface movements of magma by monitoring the earthquakes and measuring the ground changes that accompany such movements http pubs usgs gov gip mountain Photograph showing Sinking Creek Mountain in the Jefferson National Forest http pubs usgs gov
