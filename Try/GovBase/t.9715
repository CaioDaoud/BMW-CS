Aquatic Invasive Species See also res Programs invasive Great Lakes Aquatic Nonindigenous Species List Aquatic invasive species are a global threat that affect the economic security management and beneficial uses of our coastal ecosystems In order to maximize the benefits and effectiveness of NOAA s research investments towards understanding preventing responding to and managing aquatic species invasions in U S coastal ecosystems the agency established the NOAA National Center for Research on Aquatic Invasive Species in July 2003 The Center is administratively housed at the Great Lakes Environmental Research Laboratory in Ann Arbor Michigan table is for layout only Unionid mussel infested with Zebra mussels Zebra mussels Dreissena polymorpha on native Unionid mussel Native mussels populations have been eliminated in many areas of the Great Lakes by zebra mussel colonization such as shown here Zebra mussels are called the poster child for aquatic invasive species because their invasion of the Great Lakes in the late 1980s led to major policy initiatives at the national level in the United States Photo credit J Schloesser USGS Background and Rationale The major pathways by which aquatic invasive species AIS reach U S ecosystems all involve human activities especially commerce and trade Costs to the U S economy of AIS have reached 100s of millions of dollars per year and are mounting Solutions to problems related to AIS will undoubtedly affect both the costs and policies related to commerce and trade Congress Public Law 101 636 as amended through October 1996 and the White House Executive Order 13112 February 1999 identified aquatic species invasions as a growing national problem requiring federal action NOAA is a science based agency under the Department of Commerce whose mission it is to understand and predict changes in the Earth s environment and conserve and manage coastal and marine resources to meet our Nation s economic social and environmental needs The Department of Commerce is one of several federal agencies given joint responsibility for developing and implementing a national invasive species response and action plan NOAA carries out the Department s responsibilities by serving as Co chair of both the national Aquatic Nuisance Species Task Force and the Invasive Species Council Therefore it is appropriate and essential that NOAA assures the effectiveness and maximizes the value of its research investment on this issue Coordination and advocacy for research within NOAA as well as across agencies and partnering with the academic and private sector are essential to achieving this goal Mission and Program Elements NOAA established the National Center for Research on Aquatic Invasive Species to assure cross NOAA leadership communication and coordination for NOAA s research investments in support of understanding preventing responding to and managing aquatic species invasions in U S coastal ecosystems The Center s broad goal is to foster coordinate and support aquatic invasive species research throughout and across NOAA The Center will enhance NOAA s ability to meet its mission and strategic goals and carry out the responsibilities assigned by Public Law 101 646 as amended and Executive Order 13112 The Center will lead development of and administer a long term NOAA strategic plan for research on aquatic invasions that is based on the National Invasive Species Management Plan Specifically the Center will table is for layout only European Green Crab Green crab Carcinus maenas is a predatory invader that feeds voraciously on shellfish It was introduced to the Atlantic coast of North America during the early 19th century and spread from there to the Pacific coast where it was first found in San Francisco Bay in 1998 It has since been observed in waters of Oregon in 1998 Washington in 1998 and British Columbia in 1999 Photo credit Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife Work across NOAA to centralize an AIS research strategy that insures research is coordinated prioritized and integrated with other NOAA activities e g monitoring response restoration education related to invasive species Expand and maintain NOAA s core AIS scientific expertise to address research needs related to prevention early detection and rapid response management of successful invasions control eradication or adaptation and education and outreach Encourage exploratory biological invasion research invasion biology is a young field and much remains to be discovered Facilitate research communication with other agencies and foster research partnerships between NOAA other agencies universities and private sector entities via the ANS Task Force NOAA s Cooperative Institutes programs and the National Sea Grant Program Identify and seek support for collaborative research opportunities between U S and foreign scientists The proposed elements of the Center include 1 a Regional Coordination Program covering six coastal regions east coast west coast Great Lakes Gulf of Mexico Alaska and Hawaii to ensure NOAA s AIS research is national in scope but responds to regional priorities 2 a Post doctoral and Visiting Scientist Research Program to enhance and maintain NOAA s core research capabilities at the cutting edge of AIS science and understanding and 3 a broad NOAA AIS Research Program to assure that NOAA s scientists have the resources required to support and advance both NOAA s mission needs and National needs as identified by the National Management Plan and various stakeholders table is for layout only Ballast Residual Looking down through the access hatch of a ballast tank on a commercial bulk carrier Ballast water is implicated as the major vector for AIS introductions to coastal ecosystems However even empty ballast tanks can contain enough residual mud and water to support live organisms Photo credit Great Lakes NOBOB Program Team The Research Center will work closely with the ANS Task Force and the National Invasive Species Council to incorporate national AIS research priorities into NOAA s programs A close working relationship between the Center the National Sea Grant Program and NOAA s Cooperative Institutes Program will enhance NOAA s ability to accomplish its mission and goals by coordinating research priorities leveraging resources towards common interests and fostering joint research enterprises between NOAA scientists and university or private sector scientists Aquatic invasive species for the most part originate from outside the borders of the U S and thus invasive species are an international problem requiring international cooperation Often the only or at least the most comprehensive information about an invasive organism is found in the scientific community of the source ecosystem or country The AIS Research Center will help identify partnership opportunities between U S and foreign scientists It will encourage and support collaborative research planning and projects sharing of scientific information and research projects to identify means of interdicting AIS introduction to the U S Organization The Center is administratively housed at the Great Lakes Environmental Research Laboratory in Ann Arbor Michigan which has been conducting research on invasive species since 1989 GLERL is the only NOAA internal research unit that houses a core of scientists with over a decade of experience and growing expertise specifically addressing aquatic species invasions as well as the multidisciplinary capability to conduct and coordinate the type of regional research necessary to address the complexity of the issues involved GLERL has a long history of research on invasive species and supports a broad program of AIS research covering prevention ecosystem impacts and forecasting and monitoring It leads multiple AIS research programs in partnership with universities University of Michigan University of Windsor Canada Old Dominion University Michigan State University and other government agencies U S Navy Smithsonian Environmental Research Center USEPA U S Coast Guard Great Lakes
