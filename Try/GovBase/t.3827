maunaloa Mauna Loa Current Activity 0550 December 9 Note Your observer will be in North America for the rest of the week Expect the next scheduled update on Saturday December 13 A misty Tuesday morning finds no change at Mauna Loa Inflation is continuing at the summit where the GPS network first showed definite lengthening of the lines across the summit caldera in late April or May 2002 after nearly 10 years of slight deflation The summit expansion tailed off and perhaps stopped in mid winter 2002 2003 It then resumed starting on about February 15 slackened and once more began in late April or early May The lengthening again slowed during the summer but accelerated as summer ended We interpret the lengthening uplift and tilting to indicate resumed swelling of the magma reservoir within the volcano Seismicity however remains low Current Mauna Loa Data gps Global Positioning System GPS tilt Electronic Tilt seismic Seismicity Activity Summary 1974 2002 http hvo wr usgs gov maunaloa current longterm html Long term monitoring data Global Positioning System GPS Data Map of GPS stations at Mauna Loa summit caldera We maintain several continuously recording global positioning system GPS stations on Mauna Loa including the AIN2 MOKP MLSP and ELEP stations shown on the map above Additional stations on indefinite loan from Stanford University will be installed over the next several weeks Check this page for updates on our progress GPS data are usually processed about 24 hours after collection using the rapid satellite orbit information distributed by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory Final orbits are released about two weeks later and the GPS data are then re processed Consequently the last two weeks or so worth of data on the graph should be considered preliminary Plotted below is the change in distance between the stations MOKP and MLSP located on opposite sides of Moku aweoweo Mauna Loa s caldera We interpret an increase in the distance between these two stations to represent inflation of the summit magma reservoir In May 2002 the distance between these two stations abruptly began extending reversing an almost decade long trend of contraction GPS line length across summit caldera A fairly rapid increase in distance across the summit caldera 5 6 cm year started in late April May 2002 The rate started to slow in late October or early November and had flattened by year s end Starting in early February 2003 the distance started to lengthen again In general data for the past two weeks shown on this graph are subject to greater error than older data owing to the use of rapid orbit corrections For more information on how GPS systems help monitor the deformation of Mauna Loa and Kilauea volcanoes see a http hvo wr usgs gov howwork subsidence inflate deflate html summary of the inflation deflation of summit magma chambers Electronic Tiltmeter Data Mauna Loa tiltmeter stations We maintain several continuously recording electronic tiltmeters on Mauna Loa Three additional borehole tiltmeters have been purchased and will be installed at the sites indicated in yellow by the end of 2002 The graph below shows two components of tilt recorded at MOK over the last month Positive changes on the plot indicate tilting of the ground at the tiltmeter site toward the north and east The tiltmeter is located northwest of the summit magma chamber so tilt toward the northwest would indicate inflation of the magma reservoir Electronic tiltmeters are highly sensitive instruments designed to detect minute changes in a volcano s shape Unfortunately this sensitivity makes electronic tiltmeters respond to signals that have nothing to do with volcanic processes temperature for example As the ground heats and cools it deforms slightly resulting in a measurable tilt Consequently the tilt record contains a diurnal signal corresponding to the daily temperature fluctuations and an annual signal corresponding to seasonal temperature changes This fact makes tiltmeters far less useful than GPS receivers for tracking relatively slow long lived processes Rather tiltmeters excel at imaging fast short term events that might pass unnoticed by GPS 2 month tilt record at MOK tiltmeter Tilt as recorded by Moku aweoweo tiltmeter No significant volcanic tilt was recorded over the time period shown in this graph The tilt shown by the north component is seasonal related to changes in ground temperature at this high 4 km station We are looking for abrupt departures from this seasonal trend that will indicate volcanic tilt The offset in both components on August 26 2003 was caused by a M5 0 earthquake on Kilauea s south flank and does not record an unusual volcanic event at Mauna Loa For more information

summit magma chambers Current Seismicity Since a swarm of deep earthquakes centered just south of the caldera in late April seismicity has been at a somewhat elevated level though still far lower than
