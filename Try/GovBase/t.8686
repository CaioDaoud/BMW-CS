I obtain a course schedule Since the agency is the entity that enrolls a student they are the only ones who know when they plan on sending a particular employee Therefore the FLETC course schedule would be of no benefit to an individual You should check with your agency Additionally the course schedule is constantly changing as the FLETC adjusts the schedule to meet the needs of the agencies and to accommodate other scheduling requirements Just because a course is scheduled does not necessarily mean it will actually occur because of these last minute changes and requirements How does an individual enroll at the FLETC The FLETC does not select students for admission that is done by the individual s agency Each agency has its own regulations and hiring criteria regarding training required Once a person is selected by his or her agency to attend training at the FLETC the agency actually accomplishes the enrollment and would notify the person of any enrollment requirements that may need to be completed Agencies reserve training seats ahead of time and they determine when a particular individual will be sent for training at the Center Individuals do not enroll directly In other words to attend FLETC training programs one must normally be employed in a law enforcement position and will be enrolled for training by the employer Can I enroll at the FLETC if I am not in a law enforcement position The FLETC was created to train federal law enforcement officers There is an on site office that represents State Local and International law enforcement personnel Private sector students can be admitted if the admission criteria is satisfied and a Partner Agency sponsors the student Appropriate documentation from the Partner Agency is forwarded to the Director of the Office of State Local and International training for his approval Is e mail and or internet access available to students at the FLETC Yes In the main classroom building there are 48 computers on line upstairs and 12 computers on line downstairs available to access personal e mail internet accounts We are hoping to double that number by the end of the fiscal year You may also access your personal e mail or Internet account from those dorm rooms with phones To do so you must have your own computer and you must be able to access your Internet Service Provider ISP either by a local Brunswick GA phone number or by using a toll free number provided by the ISP Another possible solution would be to use your personal telephone credit card toll free number to call your ISP but this would be a long
