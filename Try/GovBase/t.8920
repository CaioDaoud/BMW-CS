Ed Szoke s Homepage Welcome to FSL Ed Szoke s Homepage Greetings I m a meteorologist at the NOAA http www fsl noaa gov Forecast System s Lab FSL working on a variety of projects with the general goal of transfering technology to the operational forecast environment I actually work for NOAA FSL as an employee of http www cira colostate edu CIRA Projects LAPS local model verification FSL has been testing the Prediction part of LAPS http laps fsl noaa gov LAPS the Local Analysis and Prediction System over the past several years using several local scale WFO scale models including a version of

minute weather briefing daily starting at 1100 LT in room 3C405 Everyone is welcome to attend Briefers come mainly from the staff at FSL but also from other groups within the NOAA Labs at the David

new features like D3D 3 Giving staff of FSL and others in NOAA the opportunity to stay connected with the weather and weather forecasting 4 Providing a forum to discuss occurring and upcoming weather
