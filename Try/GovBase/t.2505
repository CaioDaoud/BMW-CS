draft of NIST Special Publication 800 61 Computer Security Incident Handling Guide This publication seeks to help both established and newly formed incident response teams respond effectively and efficiently to a variety of incidents More specifically this document discusses the following items 1 organizing a computer security incident response capability 2 establishing incident response policies and procedures 3 structuring an incident response team and 4 handling incidents from initial preparation through the post incident lessons learned phase Finally it discusses handling a range of incidents such as denial of service malicious code unauthorized access inappropriate usage and multiple component incidents NIST welcomes public comments on the draft until October 15 2003 Comments

to mailto EncryptionModes nist gov EncryptionModes nist gov Comment period is NOW closed NOTE If you are looking for a draft computer security publication and can t find it here the http csrc nist gov publications draft probably has been finalized check the FIPS or Special Publication link once on this page Trouble viewing pdf files from this page Here are several tips which will hopefully resolve the problem Are you using Internet Explorer Internet Explorer requires you to enable Active x controls for pdf and other plug ins If this feature is disabled then you will not be able to view pdf files from CSRC website and most likely from other websites as well When Active x controls for pdf and other plug ins is enabled it should work You probably want to check with your system administrator to see if your browser and or Adobe Reader is configured properly This is a FYI on how to enable the active x control for pdf and other plug ins in Microsoft IE Netscape uses a different technique Go to the Tools drop down menu top of your browser menu bar then left click on the Internet options then left click the Security tab then look for the custom level button and click the button find Run Active X controls and Plug ins there will be other references to Active X but choose ONLY this one and click the Enable circle Then hit ok to exit Once this feature is enabled you will be able to view pdf files from our CSRC website or any other website If you don t want to view the pdf files from CSRC with Adobe Reader within your browser instead of clicking the link to view the pdf file s you can place your cursor above the link cursor will then change to a hand and then RIGHT click the link You will see a little window box Click the save file as option Then you will see another window to save the file and you can save the file to your system or to where ever you would like the file to be saved Then once you save the file you should be able to open up Adobe Reader without using your browser to view the pdf file If your settings are properly set to download or view pdf files from the Internet several people had told us that in order for them to view a rather large pdf file within Adobe Reader they had to close most to all of their applications Also some people told us that they had to clean out their temporary cache folders for there was not enough memory in their temporary cache Last updated December 1 2003 Page created February 23 2001 http www nist gov public affairs disclaim htm Disclaimer Notice http www nist gov public affairs privacy htm Privacy
