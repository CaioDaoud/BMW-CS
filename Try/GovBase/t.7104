over pipelines covers more than 3 000 gathering transmission and distribution operators as well as some 52 000 master meter and liquefied natural gas LNG operators who own and or operate approximately 1 6 million miles of gas pipelines in addition to over 200 operators and an estimated 155 000 miles of hazardous liquid pipelines OPS currently has approximately 70 employees half work at Headquarters in Washington DC and the other half work in the five OPS regional offices located in Washington DC Atlanta GA Kansas City MO Houston TX and Lakewood CO These employees work within the following

Management Rule making RSPA s Office of Pipeline Safety OPS intends to incorporate a process into its regulations to validate pipe integrity in high density population areas waters where a substantial likelihood of commercial navigation exists and areas unusually sensitive to environmental damage On November 18th and 19th 1999 OPS held a public meeting to determine the extent to which operators now have integrity management programs to explore effective ways to promote their development and implementation by all operators and to discuss mechanisms by which OPS could confirm the existence and adequacy of such operator developed programs top TOP http www cycla com opsiswc wc dll PRIMIS TopPage sub 01 lp 55 u lp Risk Management Initiative A variety of activities related to the concept of risk management have been initiated within the Office of Pipeline Safety and the pipeline industry over the last couple of years These activities have been motivated by a desire a recognition a concern and a concept on the part of both the government and the industry top TOP http www npms rspa dot gov default htm National Pipeline Mapping System NPMS The U S DOT Office of Pipeline Safety OPS administers the national regulatory program to assure the safe and environmentally sound transportation of natural gas liquefied natural gas and hazardous liquids by pipeline The Accountable Pipeline Safety and Partnership Act of 1996 requires that OPS adopt rules requiring interstate gas pipeline operators to provide maps of their facilities to the governing body of each municipality in which the pipeline is located OPS is also required to adopt rules requiring pipeline operators to identify facilities located in unusually sensitive areas and high density population areas to maintain maps and records detailing that information and to provide maps to federal and state officials upon request A joint government industry pipeline mapping quality team MQAT I developed a set of strategies concerning how the OPS could develop reasonable pipeline location information without creating an undue burden on the pipeline industry The findings of MQAT I are described in Strategies for Creating a National Pipeline Mapping System The second joint Government Industry Pipeline Mapping Quality Action Team MQATII developed standards for the states and the national repository as well as Pipeline and Liquefied Natural Gas Operator Submission standards MQATII drafted these standards and incorporated appropriate recommendations outside those developed by the action team top TOP opa htm Oil Pollution Act OPA The liquid pipeline network in the United States consists of about 155 000 miles of hazardous liquid pipelines that more than 220 operators run The Office of Pipeline Safety OPS has regulations for pipeline design construction operation maintenance and emergency response to ensure safe hazardous liquid transportation The Agency s mission is to protect people and the environment through a comprehensive program featuring effective risk management regulatory compliance and a strong balanced Federal State partnership OPS implements the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 OPA 90 provisions for onshore oil pipelines OPS seeks to make pipeline oil spills less likely to diminish the spills threats to people and the environment and strengthen the response to spills Just as oil tanker operators are required to submit oil spill response plans to the Coast Guard and refinery operators are required to submit the plans to the Environmental Protection Agency oil pipeline operators are required to submit their facility response plans FRP s to OPS for review and approval More than 1 500 facility response plans have been submitted to OPS They represent 250 oil pipeline operators and lines that range from three inch gathering systems to thirty six inch product lines and the forty eight inch Trans Alaska Pipeline System OPS thoroughly reviews the plans emphasizing the adequacy of the pipeline operator s response resources incident command system and ability to protect environmentally sensitive areas OPS makes sure that pipeline operators plans are consistent with the National Contingency Plan and the local Area Contingency Plan which the Coast Guard and EPA write OPS seeks to better protect people and the environment by conducting table top and area exercises OPS has conducted more than 80 table top and about six area exercises to test how well operators prevent and respond to oil spills The scenarios present worst case scenarios A team of Federal State and local environmental and emergency response agencies and company representatives design the area drills which include equipment deployment The working relationships built during drills helped government and industry workers better prevent and respond to oil spills from pipelines OPS helps conduct and evaluate drills that the Coast Guard EPA and industry sponsor OPS works with the National Response Team and the eleven Region Response Teams that the EPA and Coast Guard lead For example OPS played a key role in drafting and implementing an Integrated Contingency Planning tool that won a Hammer Award for streamlining Federal contingency planning requirements Rather than filing several contingency plans operators could meet all Federal requirements with a single plan OPS works closely with natural resource trustee agencies including the Department of the Interior and the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration to identify sensitive resources that need extra protection from oil spills OPS responds to catastrophic pipeline spills by sending inspectors to investigate the accident and sending a liaison officer to represent OPS in the unified command structure This practice provides a source of pipeline expertise for the EPA or Coast Guard on scene coordinator For more information on the OPA 90 program contact the Office of Pipeline Safety at 202 366 4595 Bullet document

Spills top TOP usa htm Unusually Sensitive Areas USA The pipeline safety statute directed the Office of Pipeline Safety OPS to describe areas that are unusually sensitive to environmental damage in the event of a hazardous liquid pipeline release and to establish a method for identifying hazardous liquid pipelines located in those areas The goal is to provide added protection to these particularly sensitive areas Once USAs are identified and located pipeline operators will conduct risk assessments to determine if a release from a particular pipeline segment can impact an USA The risk assessments will include consultations when necessary with Federal and state agencies responsible for protecting threatened and endangered species depleted marine mammals or critical drinking water resources Segments of pipeline where a release could impact an USA will be subject to additional prevention mitigation and response measures OPS recently published a proposed rule on imp htm Enhanced Protection in High Consequence Areas that identifies how pipeline operators are to address and best protect USAs as well as other high consequence areas On December 30 1999 OPS published a http frwebgate access gpo gov cgi bin getdoc cgi dbname 1999 register docid 99 33614 filed Notice of Proposed Rulemaking for USA s in the Federal Register This proposed rule defines drinking water and ecological areas that are unusually sensitive to environmental damage if there is a hazardous liquid pipeline release The comment period for the proposed rule closes June 27 2000 Five public workshops and numerous technical meetings were held to create the proposed definition and model for USAs The first workshop was held on June 15 16 1995 and focused on criteria being considered to determine USAs A second workshop held on October 17 1995 focused on developing a process that could be used to determine if an area is a USA The third workshop on January 18 1996 focused on guiding principles for determining USAs A fourth workshop held April 10 11 1996 discussed the criteria components and parameters of the terms that have been used when describing USAs The fifth workshop held June 18 19 1996 discussed drinking water resources Additional information on these workshops can be obtained through the Dockets Unit Room 8421 RSPA U S DOT 400 Seventh Street SW Washington DC 20590 0001 reference Docket PS 140 or by contacting Christina Sames at 202 366 4561 OPS and the American Petroleum Institute API have pilot tested the proposed definition and model for USAs in the states of Texas California and Louisiana These states represent about forty six percent of liquid pipelines in the United States The pilot was conducted to determine whether there are good data sources available to support the model whether the model provides a functional definition that can be used to define and identify USAs and if the resultant maps identify the majority of the drinking water and ecological USAs in the three states OPS published a INTENT9 htm Notice of Intent to Pilot Test in the Federal Register to describe the pilot test On April 27 and 28 2000 OPS held a public workshop to discuss the dwwater htm USA drinking water definition and model the ecomodel htm USA ecological definition and model and the pilotresults htm pilot results workshopatt htm Workshop attendees included federal and state agencies academia environmental groups and members of the public The workshop also served to kick off a techreview htm technical review of the pilot results The review will help identify other data sets that might be used other resources that might be considered and will help improve the definition s capability to identify the majority of USAs This technical peer review is the final step in the pilot study OPS will use the comments of this technical peer review of the models and the pilot study public comments on the final report of the pilot study and comments on the proposed rule itself to move toward a final USA definition by the end of this year API plans to publish a guidance document describing the model and its application to assist operators in understanding this issue top TOP partnership htm Federal State Partnership The statutes under which OPS operates provide for state assumption of all or part of the intrastate regulatory and enforcement responsibility through annual certifications and agreements Most states have supported the concept of common stewardship in pipeline safety This cooperative collaborative relationship between the federal and state government the Federal State Partnership forms the cornerstone of the pipeline safety program Federal grant funds are used as an incentive to improve state program performance and to encourage states to take on more responsibility for pipeline OPS is authorized to reimburse a state agency up to 50 percent of the actual cost for carrying out the state s pipeline safety program including the cost of personnel and equipment Federal funding is determined through an allocation formula based on factors such as the extent to which the state asserts safety jurisdiction whether the state has adopted all federal requirements and the number and qualifications of the inspectors top TOP regulate htm Regulatory Development The federal pipeline safety regulations 1 assure safety in design construction inspection testing operation and maintenance of natural gas and hazardous liquid pipeline facilities and in the siting construction operation and maintenance of LNG facilities 2 set out parameters for administering the pipeline safety program 3 require pipeline operators to implement and maintain anti drug and alcohol misuse prevention programs for employees who perform safety sensitive functions and 4 delineate requirements for onshore oil pipeline response plans The regulations are written as minimum performance standards setting the level of safety to be attained and allowing the pipeline operators discretion in achieving that level top TOP comply htm Compliance and Safety A major aspect of pipeline safety is a sound comprehensive compliance program conducted by Regional Offices To allocate its compliance resources in a manner to maximize the impact on safety OPS uses a computer based tool known as the pipeline inspection priority program PIPP which ranks pipeline units on system characteristics filed reports and accident data PIPP increases productivity by targeting inspections based on risk OPS investigates major pipeline accidents to determine whether violations of regulations occurred whether revisions or additions to the regulations are needed and to ascertaining the cause of an accident The objectives of an OPS investigation are to ensure future integrity of the pipeline and develop a sound basis for any enforcement actions taken In addition to their responsibility for overseeing the compliance of interstate operators the OPS regional offices are responsible for monitoring the performance of the state agencies participating in the federal state pipeline safety program as well as performing inspections of interstate pipeline systems and those intrastate facilities not under state jurisdiction top TOP training htm Training OPS sponsors a number of training activities designed to familiarize government and industry personnel with the requirements of pipeline safety regulations and to educate federal and state inspectors in compliance requirements inspection techniques and enforcement procedures These activities include in depth classroom training at the Department s Transportation Safety Institute located in Oklahoma City OK as well as at various regional and state seminars top TOP research htm Research OPS conducts research to support regulatory and enforcement activity and to provide the technical and analytical foundation necessary for planning evaluating and implementing the pipeline safety program An example of ongoing research is the definition of environmentally sensitive areas as that term would be used for pipeline operations subject to mandates under the Pipeline Safety Act of 1992 and the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 More information on our pipeline safety research initiative can be found on the following web site http primis rspa dot gov rd index htm http primis rspa dot gov rd index htm top TOP stats htm Pipeline Safety Data Analysis OPS collects compiles and analyzes pipeline safety data to aid in decision making associated with regulation revisions compliance and training OPS maintains a reporting system for compiling accident safety related condition reports submitted by gas and hazardous liquid pipeline operators as well as annual reports submitted by gas pipeline operators which include information on miles and types of pipelines Pipeline Operator filed incident reports annual reports for natural gas companies and safety related conditions reports are found under the ONLINE library section of this website at libindex htm http ops dot gov libindex htm Summary statistics are published on this website at stats htm http ops dot gov stats htm top TOP drug htm Drug and Alcohol Program The drug and alcohol testing regulations require operators of gas hazardous liquid and carbon dioxide pipelines other than operators of master meter systems and liquefied natural gas LNG facilities to have anti drug and alcohol misuse prevention programs applicable to persons who perform operating maintenance or emergency response functions covered by the DOT pipeline safety regulations in 49 CFR Parts 192 193 or 195 and to conduct drug and alcohol testing in accordance with the regulations Drug testing under Part 199 Subpart A is to be conducted prior to employment after an accident randomly upon reasonable cause and upon the return to duty of an employee who fails or refuses a drug test conducted under Part 199 Alcohol testing under Part 199 Subpart B is to be conducted upon reasonable suspicion upon the return to duty of an employee who fails or refuses an alcohol test conducted under Part 199 top TOP diamond index html OPS Home Page sear htm Search
