Service Modernization For several years the National Weather Service NWS has been engaged in activities directed toward modernizing and restructuring its operations The activities include as major components the development of a new radar system NEXRAD WSR 88D a new automated surface observing system ASOS and a new communications and forecaster workstation system the Advanced Weather Interactive Processing System AWIPS In order to make more effective use of the talents of its staff of professional meteorologists the NWS has reorganized its operations Until the late 1990s 52 Weather Service Forecast Offices WSFOs performed the bulk of the forecasting functions for generally statewide areas and 180 Weather Service Offices WSOs and other small offices provided local adaptive forecasts Both WSFOs and WSOs issued severe weather warnings though many WSOs operated on a less than 24 hour schedule and were backed up by their parent WSFO at night The restructured National Weather Service includes 122 Weather Forecast Offices WFOs roughly collocated with WSR 88Ds AWIPS provides the communications and forecast support functions for these offices 1 2 AWIPS In the early 1980s the NWS Office of Meteorology along with representatives of NWS administrative development and field offices plus what is now the Forecast Systems Laboratory FSL prepared requirements for AWIPS These form the basis of the functional requirements included in the AWIPS System Requirements Specification SRS and the AWIPS Development Phase contract In preparation for the development and deployment of AWIPS the NWS asked FSL to participate in several risk reduction activities The primary activity was developing and testing a series of forecaster workstations at the Denver and Norman WSFOs Systems known as DARE Denver AWIPS Risk Reduction and Requirements Evaluation in Denver and Pre AWIPS in Norman were used by the WSFO staffs for several years ending in the late 1990s These systems provided valuable insight into modernized operations experience gained in Denver and Norman was used to refine AWIPS specifications The AWIPS Development Phase contract was awarded to Planning and Research Corporation PRC in December 1992 By early 1994 it had become apparent that PRC s progress was being hindered by the vast number of requirements in the AWIPS SRS An independent review team recommended restructuring the AWIPS development process giving the NWS more responsibility for application development and allowing PRC to concentrate on the basic workstation and communications systems Goals of the restructuring included ensure development of a system that supports life cycle AWIPS requirements establish a system development process that facilitates rapid incremental development testing and deployment and redefine the scope of the initial deployment baseline and scheduled upgrades as necessary to preserve the basic deployment schedule and minimize impact to the overall NWS modernization The Techniques Development Laboratory TDL now MDL was given the responsibility of developing most of the meteorological applications for AWIPS Joint PRC NWS teams worked to define the basic user interface menu system database structure data interfaces etc for AWIPS The NWS continues work to define an AWIPS application programmer interface PRC presented the high level system architecture to the NWS in November 1994 The NWS and PRC began to develop a series of incremental prototype AWIPS systems beginning in mid 1995 with 4 1 Pathfinder at a few future WFOs and collocated River Forecast Centers RFCs AWIPS Build 1 was installed at around 10 sites in late 1996 with upgrades to Build 2 and 2 1 by May 1997 In August 1996 the NWS decided that WFO Advanced would be the in office component of AWIPS FSL delivered a version of the software to NWS in March 1997 to support Build 3 a slightly revised version went officially to PRC on 30 May This was deployed at some two dozen offices in the latter half of 1997 1 3 FX and FX ALPHA Throughout the 1980s all FSL built forecaster workstations including the DARE Pre AWIPS systems used VAX VMS computers and Ramtek display hardware Acknowledging the advent of the open systems computing philosophy FSL initiated in 1992 a new workstation development known as FX for FSL X based forecaster workstation In 1993 the NWS requested that this effort be expanded and redirected to broaden and extend support for operations at Denver and Norman This new system was known as FX ALPHA for FSL X based AWIPS Like Prototype for Hydrometeorological Applications Bullock and Grote 1994 The primary objectives were to continue the AWIPS risk reduction work that could no longer be supported by the current systems and to develop at FSL expertise in the AWIPS environment This latter emphasis allowed FSL to continue its role as a technology transfer organization at the same time providing an independent perspective on AWIPS issues 2 Development Goal The goal of the WFO Advanced forecaster workstation development was to demonstrate a workstation that supports modernized NWS WFO operations This included data ingest management and display automated product generation hydrometeorological applications and product dissemination together providing the opportunity to address the Congressionally mandated staffing requirements for the modernized weather service Such modernized WFO operations were demonstrated in 1995 using a WFO Advanced system in two real time forecast exercises http www sdd fsl noaa gov fxa publications 12th IIPS 96 Woody IIPS96 html Roberts et al 1996 followed by operational demonstration at the Denver WSFO 3 Components The WFO Advanced system comprises the following components national and local data feeds the Mesoscale Analysis and Prediction System MAPS Surface Assimilation System MSAS and its attendant Quality Control and Monitoring System FSL s Local Analysis and Prediction System LAPS providing high resolution analyses and short range forecasts an interactive display system forecaster workstation for data access and manipulation the GFESuite user component of the AWIPS Interactive Forecast Preparation System IFPS which supports computer generation of routine forecast products 3 d visualization for viewing model grids not yet routinely implemented at field offices hydrology applications developed at the NWS Office of Hydrology and an FSL built dissemination system providing data to local governments and emergency operations staffs Figure 1 illustrates these WFO Advanced components Items within the dashed line have a presence on the display IFPS and 3 d visualation where in use run on the newer Linux PC workstations due to performance limitations on the original Hewlett Packard equipment 3 1 Forecaster Workstation D 2D The forecaster workstation is the central element of the WFO Advanced system The subsystem known as D 2D for Display 2 Dimensional is a continuation of the FX ALPHA work Design considerations included meeting AWIPS performance specifications exploring trade offs between pre generated and on the fly graphics displays providing support for interactive graphics techniques and isolating vendor specific code to ensure transportability A key area of early investigation was the user interface in particular considering how menus and windows interact For example in a multiple window system is there one menu whose commands are directed to a selected window a drag and drop system one menu per window Prototype work in this area tested multi window and single window systems Experience proved that a multi pane single window system was easier for forecasters to use than one with multiple resizable windows Most forecasters found that window management distracted them from their task Later investigation tested the concept of sharing a mouse between two displays or having one mouse per screen Although forecasters preferred the flexibility afforded by the latter HP could not promise hardware support for that approach and the NWS decided to go with the one mouse setup 3 2 LAPS The goal of FSL s Local Analysis and Prediction System McGinley et al 1992 is to provide real time three dimensional local scale analyses and short range forecasts for operational use LAPS fuses meso beta scale 20 200 km data from existing and future data platforms including Doppler radar wind profiler surface sensors satellite and aircraft producing high resolution analyses and forecasts over a WFO s area of forecast responsibility Running http laps fsl noaa gov LAPB AWIPS WFO page htm LAPS at operational weather facilities allows high resolution data to be used locally without the need to transmit large volumes of data and model results LAPS is being developed by the http laps fsl noaa gov Local Analysis and Prediction Branch of FSL s Forecast Research Division Their work addresses the needs of many government agencies in the areas of data analysis data fusion data assimilation quality control three dimensional display and visualization and numerical modeling LAPS work for WFO Advanced covers three specific areas Creating a locatable LAPS grid that can be easily tailored to run at any WFO deployed as part of AWIPS Build 5 0 Standardizing the data ingest components in particular to accommodate site specific local data sources Developing the predictive component of LAPS for use in WFOs Work continues in this area with the goal of producing a version that will run in real time on desktop desk side workstations LAPS analysis code is part of the standard AWIPS complement at CONUS sites The forecast component was run at the Denver Boulder WFO from mid 1997 through mid 2000 and is part of the more recent http www sdd fsl noaa gov RSA RSA work at FSL 3 3 MSAS QCMS A CONUS domain hourly surface analysis is part of the WFO Advanced core software The analysis is provided by the http www sdd fsl noaa gov MSAS msas html MAPS Surface Assimilation System developed by the FSL Systems Development Division Data used by MSAS are quality controlled by the http www sdd fsl noaa gov MSAS qcms html Quality Control and Monitoring System QCMS provides QC information and statistics to AWIPS users and data providers Both static single station and time and dynamic checks are performed on both hourly and sub hourly data 3 4 IFP The NWS as part of its modernization and restructuring program has specified that WFOs will maintain a set of gridded digital forecasts from which routine forecast products for all services public marine aviation etc will be automatically generated This approach known as http tgsv5 nws noaa gov msm ifp ifphome htm Interactive Forecast Preparation is being developed at FSL and MDL For decades NWS forecasters have generated weather forecasts using the same basic process After reviewing numerical model output and regional observations they spend roughly half of their shift composing forecasts in the form of text messages and disseminating them to various clients IFPS will not only relieve the forecasters of the burden of typing these text messages but promises to fundamentally change the way forecasts are produced by shifting emphasis from text composition to interactive editing of gridded datasets FSL has developed a suite of graphical forecast editing tools known as the http www md fsl noaa gov eft rpp rpp html Graphical Forecast Editor GFE with which the forecaster will prepare and manage these gridded forecast datasets NOAA 1993 Mathewson 1996 For AWIPS these editors have been tied together with database initialization techniques developed at MDL using Model Output Statistics or MOS and FSL RUC Eta LAPS smart initialization and text generators from FSL and MDL All field offices are now using GFE for graphical preparation of most routine forecasts with AWIPS 3 5 3 d Display FSL has been experimenting with three dimensional visualization for several years The primary focus has been work with the LAPS and http maps fsl noaa gov MAPS grids Examples of FSL model visualization have appeared in several publications e g the covers of the Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society 75 no 3 March 1994 and the Preprints Tenth International Conference on Interactive Information and Processing Systems for Meteorology Oceanography and Hydrology AMS Nashville Tennessee January 1994 Over the last couple of years of the 1990s http d3d fsl noaa gov an AWIPS like user interface was developed to provide intuitive access to 3 d displays in support of routine operations Other recent 3 d work at FSL includes a visualization and editing system for aviation impact variables AIVs such as turbulence and icing and a display system for lightning data for the RSA program These are not yet part of the standard WFO Advanced complement 3 6 LDAD Prototype AWIPS Local Data Acquisition and Dissemination functions were developed at FSL This work encompasses acquisition of local datasets for example mesonets highway department weather sensors ALERT networks for use by NWS forecasters and dissemination of advanced meteorological information to local governments and other users The http www sdd fsl noaa gov ldad documents ans3 html NOAA Emergency Management Weather Dissemination Project Subramaniam and Jesuroga 1995 conducted experiments in this area Early work included acquisition of data from the Colorado Department of Transportation and the Denver Urban Drainage and Flood Control District and interaction with the City of Boulder and Boulder County emergency management offices where an experimental decision support system was tested In addition to general weather data the latter included information about flash flood potential conditions for wild fire initiation severe convective and winter storms and other weather related information important in emergency management operations More recently work focused on a http www sdd fsl noaa gov ldad rppldad Rapid Prototyping Project for the Emergency Management Descision Support System EMDS Development in this area is currently suspended and all LDAD related maintenance is now the responsibility of the NWS It is hoped that future work will tie the official forecast database as embodied in the IFP grids to the dissemination system to provide improved forecast data to emergency operations staffs 4 Related Projects Other government organizations have been involved with projects that are similar to parts of WFO Advanced Other NWS groups also have experience with modern computer networks and computer graphics notably the Office of Hydrology which has been working on RFC related systems and the NWS Alaska Region where forecaster programmers have developed a number of UNIX X applications to support forecast operations 4 1 Pathfinder As noted earlier the NWS and PRC tested an initial AWIPS prototype known as Pathfinder at two operational sites Pittsburgh and Boston Taunton and NWS headquarters beginning in June 1995 Pathfinder demonstrated in an operational setting selected features of the system architecture including an initial satellite broadcast network SBN local communications and network control selected modernization era datasets and techniques system operations and maintenance functions and provided feedback on system design and operations and maintenance plans Components of Pathfinder were drawn from the NWS Office of Hydrology OH and ARONET Alaska Region Operations Network Data were limited to GOES imagery local WSR 88D data and Eta and Rapid Update Cycle grids Applications included the NWS River Forecast System and WFO hydrology applications 4 2 N AWIPS National Centers requirements for forecaster workstations differ in many ways from those of WFOs The AWIPS SRS includes specific requirements for National Center operations The National Centers for Environmental Prediction NCEP has been developing a distributed computing and communications system N AWIPS to support National Centers forecast operations This X based system is being used at NCEP and some other NWS and academic sites N AWIPS provides access to operational and experimental numerical model graphics and grids geostationary satellite data surface and upper air observations and text products Perhaps the most significant feature of N AWIPS is its GEMPAK based desJardins and Petersen 1985 grid access module which allows forecasters to perform virtually any mathematical operation on model grids A similar flexible grid access interface has been developed for WFO Advanced 4 3 ICWF In the early 1970s TDL began development of an automated computer worded forecast system CWF It initially produced city forecasts from MOS guidance In the early 1980s the program was expanded to include zone forecasts and terminal forecasts The forecaster was presented with the end product a text forecast for editing The ICWF Interactive program began in 1985 to develop a forecast support system for AFOS It presented the forecaster with a zone based basic weather matrix which the forecaster could interactively view and modify before the text forecast was generated This version of the ICWF was limited to the forecast projections available from MOS guidance A demonstration of ICWF began at several WSFOs in 1986 WSFO Charleston still actively uses the ICWF and much of its operation is built around the ICWF digital database In 1992 ICWF was made part of the Pre AWIPS demonstration at WSFO Norman Several enhancements and recommended modifications have resulted from this experience The current version of ICWF uses a new set of weather elements that makes it easier for a forecaster to depict the desired weather Further a graphical editing system similar to AFPS s has been implemented on HP equipement at Norman and Charleston to support generation of quantitative precipitation QPF grids for RFC use ICWF was installed at 21 NWS offices as part of AWIPS Build 2 and has continued to evolve The GFESuite work mentioned above has been merged with ICWF to form the IFPS component of AWIPS 5 Development Schedule Since WFO Advanced was originally intended to demonstrate a number of AWIPS functions in advance of AWIPS development it was necessary to prepare an initial release of the system quickly to provide useful assistance to the NWS in creating AWIPS The early development schedule included five milestones A convective season exercise in August 1995 This was a single shift 5 day per week shakedown of WFO Advanced In house e g ERL NCAR forecasters worked this 4 week exercise A near complete WFO emulation in October and November 1995 This 18 hour a day 7 week operation paired FSL and NWS forecasters in an exercise to demonstrate that the AWIPS operations concept is valid Support for weather briefings at the AMS Annual Meeting Atlanta in January 1996 This included access to data from the Peachtree City WSR 88D radar mesonetwork stations in Georgia and South Carolina and the Southeast Regional LAPS analyses and forecasts then being prepared at Peachtree City for Olympics support The design of WFO Advanced makes it very easy to prepare display scales for any location Operational testing at WSFO Denver beginning in mid 1996 WFO Advanced systems were installed at Denver in May with non local data supplied by the AWIPS SBN developed for Pathfinder To date the system includes only the 2 d display and hydrology applications The Denver staff now use WFO Advanced for their day to day forecast duties Operational testing at WSFO Norman Installation was originally scheduled for September 1996 but was delayed to late 1997 by hardware budget difficulties Other milestones completed or planned as part of supporting AWIPS development include Denver fall 96 build 25 Nov 96 numerous enhancements based on the first few months of operational experience at Denver Initial Build 3 handoff 4 97
