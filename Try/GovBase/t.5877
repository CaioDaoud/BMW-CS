technicians upgrading seismic network Earthquakes in Hawai i are closely linked to volcanism They are an important part of the island building processes that have shaped the Island of Hawai i and the other Hawaiian Islands Thousands of earthquakes occur every year beneath the Island of Hawai i Eruptions and magma movement within the presently active volcanoes Kilauea Mauna Loa and Lo ihi are usually accompanied by numerous small earthquakes They originate in regions of magma storage or along the paths that magma follows as it rises and moves prior to eruption These are loosely termed volcanic earthquakes Many other earthquakes including the largest ones occur in areas of structural weakness at the base of Hawai i s volcanoes or deep within the Earth s crust beneath the island These are referred to as tectonic earthquakes In the past 150 years several strong tectonic earthquakes magnitude 6 to 8 caused extensive damage to roads buildings and homes triggered local tsunami and resulted in loss of life The most http hvo wr usgs gov earthquakes destruct destructive earthquake in Hawai i s history occurred on April 2 1868 when 81 people lost their lives With a magnitude of 7 9 and a maximum intensity of XII this destructive earthquake destroyed more than a hundred homes and generated a 15 m high tsunami along Kilauea s south coast Seismograph recording earthquakes in Hawai i Seismograph Along with other signs of volcanic activity we monitor earthquakes and seismic activity on Hawai i continuously and in real time to provide warnings of impending eruption and to assess seismic hazards in the State of Hawai i http hvo wr usgs gov earthquakes new Map of current earthquakes This map of Hawai i shows the location and size of earthquakes that have occurred in the
