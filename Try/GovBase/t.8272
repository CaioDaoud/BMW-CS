for surplus employees 1 What s the difference between being designated surplus and being on an SROA list Surplus designates a class in which a department expects to lay off some or all of its employees in a designated area A department facing layoffs will designate only the least senior employees in a layoff impacted class for surplus status This would be limited to 1 5 least senior employees per position to be abolished or those employees with less than 30 months of State service Only these employees will be given SROA scantron forms to complete in order to be placed on SROA certification lists SROA status is voluntary for these least senior employees Both designations surplus and SROA entitle the employee to equal hiring preference when they apply for a vacancy The only distinction is that an employee on an SROA list may be notified by departments filling a vacancy in that class while employees using surplus status need to seek out vacancies in classes they feel qualified for and are eligible to transfer to 2 What should a department do if it has a vacancy to fill and is not in layoff mode The hiring department should take the following steps a Instruct the hiring supervisor that the appointment of a surplus employee including someone from an SROA list is a transfer not a list appointment In accordance with Government Code section 19052 appointments of surplus employees take precedence over all list appointments Appointments from reemployment lists are not subject to the SROA process and may be given precedence over employees on SROA lists Individuals with mandatory reinstatement rights have priority over all candidates including surplus and SROA list employees b Instruct the hiring supervisor that surplus and SROA list employees have equal rights to the position c Circulate job opportunity bulletins to departments in layoff mode d Post vacancies on SPB s vacant positions database VPOS e Advertise service wide classes for at least 5 working days advertise department specific classes for at least 10 calendar days f Verify status of employees claiming to be surplus 3 Does a department interviewing a surplus employee have to hire an SROA list employee before considering an employee with surplus status No Surplus and SROA list employees have the exact same rights to be hired therefore the hiring supervisor can hire an employee with either status The only distinction is that employees on SROA lists receive contact letters from hiring departments and surplus employees do not 4 How does a hiring department verify that an employee actually has surplus status All surplus employees receive letters from their departments introducing them to prospective hiring departments Letters should include the employee s name verification of surplus status current status class and layoff date If an employee has no letter the hiring department should contact the layoff department to verify status In addition SROA list eligibility serves as verification of surplus status 5 What does the term Super SROA refer to Two bargaining units Units 2 and 9 have special SROA provisions that were negotiated in their contracts several years ago Hiring departments filling vacancies in classes included in these two units must provide to the SROA Program or the layoff coordinators in the departments laying off employees in these units the class titles salaries number and location of vacancies Hiring departments must fill their vacancies with qualified surplus employees referred by layoff departments To qualify employees must meet the minimum qualifications have eligibility for the salary level of the vacancy and be in the same geographic area and bargaining unit The same geographic area has been defined as any county that touches the county in which the vacancy exists The contracts provide no exemptions 6 Is a surplus employee eligible for reimbursement if the employee must travel to an interview No There is no statute or regulation that provides for such reimbursement 7 Is a surplus employee eligible for relocation reimbursement if required to relocate to accept a new job A surplus employee is eligible for such reimbursement only if the employee has received his or her official layoff notice at the time of hire to the new job Government Code 19841 The hiring department would pay for this reimbursement Process for designating surplus SROA list employees 1 How is an employee placed on an SROA list The personnel office in a department facing layoffs gives a scantron form to employees who DPA has determined are surplus and meet the SROA list criteria Employees who want SROA list eligibility complete the form and return it to their personnel office which sends it to the State Personnel Board These names are then added to SPB s employment list for the surplus class 2 How many SROA lists may an employee s name be placed on An employee may be on only one SROA list Normally this SROA designation is for the current class in which the employee has permanent status However if that class exists only at the department where the employee is being laid off the layoff department should if possible offer to place the employee on an SROA list for an appropriate alternative class This improves the employee s chances of being contacted by other departments with job openings DPA s department analysts can assist departments in selecting an appropriate alternative class 3 Is every surplus employee placed on an SROA list No SROA list eligibility is limited to the least senior surplus employees Further if an employee is in a department specific class for which there s no comparable appropriate SROA class the surplus employee would not be placed on an SROA list However this employee could seek out available jobs that he or she feels qualified for and receive hiring preference equal to that of an employee on an SROA list 4 If an employee is on a limited term appointment can he or she be placed on the SROA list for that class No The employee would be placed on the SROA list either for the class from which he or she will be laid off or for an appropriate SROA class designated by the layoff department 5 How is an appropriate SROA class determined It must be a class that has a salary exactly the same as or lower than the layoff class it must have essentially the same class concept and it must be a class in which actual employment opportunities exist 6 Can another department s department specific class be used as an appropriate SROA class Yes but the other department must agree to its use DPA s department analysts are available to assist in resolving differences 7 Can an employee appeal the determination of an appropriate SROA class and suggest a different class The employee should discuss it with his or her personnel office DPA s department analysts are available to help personnel offices select a class and resolve disputes 8 Is it mandatory that an employee be on SROA for a full 120 days and when does the 120 day period begin The 120 day requirement applies to how long an employee is covered by the SROA Program which includes both surplus and SROA list status An employee is entitled to the full 120 days which begins when the employee s class is approved as surplus by DPA 9 If an employee initially chooses not to complete the scantron form for placement on the SROA list can the employee opt to complete the form upon receipt of the 30 day layoff notice thereby delaying the start of the 120 day period and the actual layoff No The employee s 120 day period in the SROA Program begins when his or her class is placed on surplus status by DPA regardless of whether the employee chooses to be granted SROA list status 10 Are names placed on SROA lists in seniority order No Names of employees are placed on SROA lists in random order Anyone on the employment list with SROA status may be hired regardless of relative seniority 11 Is it necessary for a department to keep checking for new SROA names on employment lists after they have ordered a certification No It s unnecessary for a hiring department to check for updates once it orders a certification from SPB 12 Is it necessary for hiring departments to contact SROA list employees in writing The initial contact may be by phone but the department must follow up in writing 13 When can a department fill a position with a non surplus or non SROA list candidate When the SROA list has been cleared and there are no surplus candidates or DPA grants an exemption or the department meets one of the exemption criteria in the SROA Manual Section VI In either of the two instances above the department would need to have a hiring freeze exemption from the Department of Finance to fill a position with a non surplus non SROA list candidate 14 Is it necessary to hire a surplus employee if it would be a promotion No Surplus status does not give an employee an advantage when it comes to promoting 15 Does a part time or permanent intermittent employee who is surplus need to be considered for a permanent full time position Only if the employee has eligibility for a permanent full time position 16 Can an appointing power require a surplus employee to serve a new probationary period Yes unless the appointment is to a class in which the employee already served a probationary period under the same appointing power Criteria for terminating surplus SROA list status 1 Can a surplus employee turn down a job offer and retain surplus status The object of the SROA Program is to find jobs for employees in jeopardy of being laid off Therefore if an employee turns down a job offer DPA will investigate to determine if there was a valid reason for the employee to turn down the offer If not the employee may lose his or her surplus SROA list status An example of a valid reason for turning down a job offer is that the employee would experience a hardship by accepting it Additionally an employee may lose surplus SROA list status if he or she does not respond to an inquiry from a potential hiring department and or does not appear for a scheduled interview or work If an employee finds a new job his or her surplus SROA list status ends 2 Does an employee s surplus status SROA list eligibilty end after 120 days even if the department s layoff is still in progress and the employee hasn t found another job Yes However DPA has the authority to extend the employee s surplus SROA list status for a maximum of 120 days SROA exemptions 1 If a surplus employee applies for a position in a class other than the class he or she currently has permanent or probationary status in does a department have to consider him or her for employment Yes However if the hiring department feels the employee does not possess the qualifications necessary for the class in question it must seek an exemption from DPA s SROA Unit Previously DPA delegated this determination to departments but the delegation has been rescinded 2 Are any SROA exemption decisions delegated to departments Yes Exemptions in Section VI of the SROA Manual are currently delegated to departments These are the only delegations made to departments All other exemption requests must be submitted to DPA s SROA Unit How the SROA Program is administered 1 What are the roles of DPA and SPB in the SROA Program DPA administers the SROA Program which includes the following responsibilities develop and maintain rules policies and procedures approve the designation of classes and employees on surplus SROA list status make decisions on surplus status exemption requests ensure compliance with SROA Program rules policies and procedures and implement corrective actions as appropriate SPB processes the SROA scantron forms and places employees on employment lists with SROA designation issues SROA employment lists removes names from SROA lists when appropriate and answers inquiries regarding certification of SROA employees 2 How can a department in layoff mode help its surplus employees find new jobs Brief all surplus employees preferably in writing of their surplus SROA list rights provide copies of the electronic scantron form and instructions for completing it ensure that the scantron forms are completed accurately and deliver them to SPB make resource material available such as the SROA Manual and DPA s Web site material on SROA layoffs provide surplus employees with individual letters of introduction that they may present to hiring departments conduct initial investigations of any alleged violations of SROA law rules or procedures and refer substantiated allegations to DPA maintain a library of job announcements provide access to SPB s vacant positions database system VPOS Areas of layoff defined 1 How many area of layoff types are there There are three types of area of layoff The two most common types are statewide and geographic The third type organizational or functional is rarely used Its use is appropriate when a department has hired employees for a specific project with a limited duration and it was understood their employment would terminate when the project was completed 2 When is the area of layoff statewide The area of layoff is statewide when the department s recruitment testing and hiring for the class were conducted on a statewide basis Another criteria is whether employees typically change residence to accept appointment to that class and or whether employees typically rotate from the position in one geographic area to another area The structure of the exam plan alone is insufficient for deciding whether the area of layoff is statewide For example if a department tests on a statewide basis for purposes of economy but applicants must indicate which specific area they will accept employment in the area of layoff for that class would be geographic not statewide An example of a statewide area of layoff would be when the layoff applies to higher level managerial classes 3 When is the area of layoff geographic The area of layoff is geographic when the department s recruitment testing and hiring for the class were conducted locally and employees in the class normally spend their entire service in that class in the original location of hire Layoffs involving working level classes and first level supervisors are examples of an area of layoff that s normally geographic 4 It sounds like the area of layoff is determined by class Does this mean a department may have more than one area of layoff Yes 5 Is there more than one type of geographic area of layoff Yes The most common geographic area of layoff would be by county Other options are by facility or by region Leave balances 1 If a surplus employee in the Annual Leave Program chooses to retire in lieu of layoff can the annual leave balance be run out past the effective date of the layoff No The employee may run out his or her annual leave only up to the date of layoff The department would have to issue a lump sum payment for any remaining balance as part of the employee s final compensation However the employee may transfer all or a portion of the leave payment to a 401 k and or 457 account with the Savings Plus Program to avoid or reduce his or her tax liability 2 Would vacation be handled in the same manner as annual leave Yes 3 What happens to an employee s unused sick leave when the employee is laid off If the employee is reemployed within the life of the reemployment list he or she is credited with the prior earned sick leave and the prior service shall be counted for purposes of calculating State service and sick leave Examples of demotional patterns 1 What are primary and secondary demotional patterns A primary demotional pattern consists of lower level classes in the same series as the class of layoff A secondary demotional pattern consists of lower level classes that meet the following criteria a knowledge and abilities are so similar that the duties of the secondary class could be satisfactorily performed within a six month period b the secondary class is a normal source of recruitment for the layoff class or has an entry level class in common with the layoff class c the secondary class does not require a license certificate or special education not required for the layoff class and d use of the secondary class will not drastically impact the operations of a layoff department by eliminating all the trained employees in a key program 2 I m a Staff Services Manager I being laid off What are my rights to demote to another position in lieu of layoff Your primary demotional path would be to the Associate level staff services analyst classes Personnel Budget Governmental Program and then to Staff Services Analyst Normally secondary demotional paths don t apply to Staff Services classes but if your department identifies such a path you d have the right to choose it Also if you previously held a permanent or probationary appointment to a class within transfer range of or at a lower salary than the class from which you re being laid off and this class is used by your department in your area of layoff you d have the right to demote to that class 3 I m an Associate Budget Analyst If I m senior to an Associate Governmental Program Analyst can I bump that person in lieu of taking a layoff No You can t bump someone in a class that has the same maximum salary rate The law governing demotional rights requires that you demote to a class with a lower maximum salary rate However if you once held a permanent or probationary appointment to the AGPA class and that class is used by your department in your area of layoff you would have personal demotional rights to AGPA and could bump an AGPA if you have the required seniority Other Associate Budget Analysts without personal demotional rights could not do so 4 I m an Associate Personnel Analyst but I held a permanent appointment five years ago as an Associate Space Planner which is at a higher pay level than the Associate Personnel Analyst Can I bump a less senior Associate Space Planner in lieu of layoff The law defining personal demotional rights states that a demotion may be to any class in which an employee held a permanent or probationary appointment and whose salary is within transfer range of or lower than the salary of the layoff class If these criteria are met and your department uses the Associate Space Planner class in your area of layoff you have a mandatory right to demote to that class Examples of employees who return to layoff department 1 One of our surplus employees got a job in another department but was rejected on probation Do we need to re hire him Yes If there are no vacancies in your department and the effective date of the layoff has not yet been reached your department could designate the employee as surplus again allowing him or her to find a job with another department However if you ve already issued 30 day layoff notices to your other employees you also should issue a 30 day notice to this employee If the effective date of the layoff has passed and there are no vacancies you should provide 30 day layoff notice and lay off the employee after the 30 day period 2 Our department is being abolished Our functions will not be transferred to any other department One of our employees is on a limited term LT appointment in another department The rules pertaining to LT appointments provide only for cancellation by the employee or the host department When his LT expires he will have nowhere to return to What are our options Issue him a layoff notice with all your other employees telling him he will have no return rights because the department and its functions will no longer exist and if he does not find a permanent appointment before the LT expires he will be laid off effective with the date of the LT appointment s termination 3 We have an employee who is on a T D assignment to another department We are about to have a layoff in her class How will this layoff affect her Calculate the employee s seniority score If her seniority is high enough to continue in the class of layoff the T D assignment can continue If not and the employee would be laid off you should terminate the T D assignment and include the employee in the layoff process If the employee would be demoted in lieu of layoff re evaluate whether the T D assignment is still appropriate after the demotion
