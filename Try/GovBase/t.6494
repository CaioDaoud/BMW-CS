that you were at the Walker Art Center but long before that you were at the PEW Charitable Trusts So coming back to The San Francisco Foundation is kind of a return home to some of your earlier roots Could you tell us what your priorities are going to be as a program officer for arts and culture at San Francisco Foundation and what you see as the challenges you face there John Killacky In the 1980 s we were looking at how foundations could invest in individual artists nurture creativity and set up laboratory experimentations At Pew we brought in folks from Bell and Dupont Labs and asked How does the corporate world invest in creativity The guy from Dupont said You ve got to have two different kinds of research going on simultaneously You have to have applied research to make sure that products get approved all the time but you also have to have free research If someone tried to invent nylon it never would have happened And it s one of those mistakes that helped Dupont really make a lot of money ultimately It was an interesting issue how do we apply this paradigm to the not for profit sector because artists aren t funded to make mistakes They re undercapitalized In the dance world choreographers may get three to six weeks to make a piece and they have to use every penny to make that piece The theatre world is the same I wish I could say twenty years later it s different for artists Things have not improved We have not found more capital for creativity In fact we may be worse off We spent decades investing in institutional stability from the large to the mid size to the small organizations In the last ten years we also invested in community engagement While this is very important it was at the artists expense We had in the early nineties The Culture Wars The National Endowment for the Arts which had been very involved in commissioning and artists fellowship programs pulled out of the supporting individual artists The State budgets increased and you tell me whether it s true or not but it increased for community engagement and not for individual artists CAC I think you re right Certainly we do very very little direct funding of artists except for the Artist Fellowship Program and I suppose the Artists in Residency Program The trend has been the funding of organizations in providing capacity building Given the political climate and the budget crises across the country do you think that trying to expand the funding directly to artists has a chance of succeeding John I don t think it would be a war worth fighting right now government funding agencies are fighting for their lives It s important that we listen to the concerns of legislators and make sure government support is much more generalized But then it is incumbent on the foundations to step up and look at what s missing The Ford Foundation has been investigating how to invest 20 million over the next ten years for the support of individual artists They are looking at training and professional development material support which is funding affordable live work insurance issues and how philanthropy can play a role in advocacy and policy Ford is also looking at information gathering to let artists know what does exist There are a number of fellowship programs across this country that artists may not know about In San Francisco arts groups employ about 10 000 people and if I aggregated all budgets together it s about 300 million At present the funding systems have been collapsing We had sixty thousand dot com ers leave the city So we have less people attending Tourism which has always been a big factor in income for the box office is still a disaster I read in the paper about a month ago that 40 000 tourist related jobs were lost in San Francisco South of Market was where so many arts groups lived in San Francisco and were pushed out when the dot com phenomena came in Two years ago there was a less than 2 vacancy Today there is 42 8 commercial vacancy here But can arts groups start to move back into some of that space Art groups were paying on the average about 48 cents a square foot in rent At the height of dot com mania they were being asked for 5 a square for rent so none of the arts groups could manage it I heard just yesterday from the Z Space that they just moved into a new space and it s 1 25 a square foot Now that is cheap by commercial standards but remember if we were paying 50 a square foot even 1 25 per square foot is an enormous increase in your overhead The Hewlett Foundation did a study of the 16 Bay Area foundations that fund the arts The numbers are startling to even say out loud but in 2001 those 16 foundations gave out 62 million to the arts just in the Bay Area In 2002 it dropped to 45 million and in 2003 Moy Eng is projecting that it will be somewhere between 27 million and 32 million to be given out to the arts So in two years 30 million in foundation support has left the Bay Area Page 1 artsmaker Killacy
