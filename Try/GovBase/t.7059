rotating docs dict ad html black hole black hole No one doubts that black holes rotate but evidence for them has been elusive Through careful analysis of data from the docs dict qz html RXTE Rossi X ray Timing Explorer Dr Strohmeyer found such evidence by examining how fast surrounding gas orbited the black hole The videos presented here illustrate this property of a rotating black hole Black

the black hole and forms a docs dict ad html disk disk Gas orbiting closer to the black hole moves faster than gas farther out The gas heats up due to interaction of material moving at these different speeds becoming hot enough to emit docs dict qz html X ray x rays Lines from the poles of the black hole represent docs dict jp html jets jets of gas being ejected from the vicinity of the black hole at nearly the docs dict qz html speed of light speed of light How these jets form is poorly understood but they are often seen near black holes accreting large amounts of material The gap between the gas disk and the black hole seen near the end of the video represents the innermost orbit docs dict jp html matter matter can be in before plunging into the black hole The radius of this innermost orbit depends on whether the black hole is rotating or not If the black hole is rotating material can orbit in more closely causing the material to move faster than if the black hole is not rotating

This video illustrates the difference between a spinning and non spinning black hole In each lines of space time are drawn around the docs dict ei html event horizon event horizon In the video the event horizon is surrounded by a blue glow which represents gas just before if falls past the event horizon The innermost stable orbit is the ring of gas outside this blue glow You can see that space time is curved around the black hole which is rotating As a consequence around a rotating black hole the gas can be in a closer orbit index html Home docs science science html Imagine Science docs
