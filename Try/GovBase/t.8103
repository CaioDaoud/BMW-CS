STEWARDSHIP Thank you for that kind introduction Greetings from President Bush Let me begin by congratulating all of you for taking part in this forum and for your commitment to the concept of corporate stewardship Let me also thank AmCham China for the hard work required in putting together the excellent program we have in place this morning The world of business is a noble calling In light of the recent corporate scandals that may be an unfashionable statement But I know that reality bears it out The vast majority of men and women in business responsibly serve their society as they serve their companies and shareholders The fundamental essence of corporate stewardship is that both of those ends are part of the same mission Companies should practice capitalism with compassion Here in China there are countless possibilities to improve lives by practicing sound corporate stewardship Last week there was a story in a U S newspaper about a new emphasis on corporate stewardship in business schools Yesterday I saw a wonderful example of corporate citizenship in a village outside Xian The Boeing Corporation s sponsorship of the Golden Key Project to help educate poor visually impaired children could be a case study I spent 26 years in the private sector I know that my company helped many of our employees realize their dreams for their families Watching those dreams become reality was the most rewarding aspect of my tenure as a company president and chief executive officer Businesses are at the strategic center of any civil society If businesses don t honor their moral responsibility who will For that reason one of the most effective acts of corporate stewardship many of you could perform is simply conducting business here in China By helping to create a private economy you are also providing life changing opportunities to millions of people And by meeting the Chinese people and spreading the values and principles that support free market capitalism you are enriching them with the knowledge to build a freer and more prosperous society U S CHINA TRADE RELATIONSHIP I know that the U S China trading relationship is vitally important to all of the businesses represented here So let me give you an overview of our perspective in Washington I have two main points First we see the US China trading relationship as key to our national interests and critical to the global economy It is destined to become even more important because in contrast to most other countries our economies are growing rapidly Under fair terms of trade we see China as a huge potential market for American capital goods and thus American jobs As China develops a middle class we see a vast market for goods and services of all types China is already America s fourth largest trading partner Bilateral trade reached 147 billion in 2002 And since 2001 China has also been the fastest growing export market for the U S up 22 percent Second this trading relationship needs work a lot of work A glance at the export tables makes clear that the United States is holding up our end of the bargain the U S market is open to Chinese products But the U S market will not remain open forever under unfair terms Within a democracy support for a lopsided relationship is not sustainable and we are already seeing strong evidence of that negative tension Trade must be fair a two way street China s leaders have promised to move to a market based economy but the pace of change is a problem China is moving far too slowly in its transition to an open market based economy Time is running out We need to see results There is friction and the slow pace of reform in the Chinese market is the source of the friction The United States is committed to working toward a free trading global environment in which economies are free of tariffs and trade barriers but it must be fair STANDING UP FOR FAIR TRADE President Bush is committed to achieving a level global playing field We are working with countries around the world to tear trade barriers down not raise new obstructions But the perception within the United States that the Chinese government either tolerates or condones unfair trading practices or is failing to effectively enforce its trade agreements is undermining support for free trade Job security job creation a strong and growing U S economy and strong global economy require free and open markets and a fair trading system We have been patient but our patience is wearing thin The American market will not remain open to Chinese exports indefinitely if the Chinese market is not equally opened to U S companies and American workers U S imports from China are five times greater than our exports This year the trade deficit could reach 130 billion We are already seeing signs of rising protectionist sentiments Over the past several months proposals have been introduced in the U S Congress that would repeal China s Normal Trading Relations status and impose a 27 percent tariff on Chinese exports These measures would be a step backwards and the Bush Administration opposes them But the message should be heard loud and clear China must move faster by opening markets dropping trade barriers and letting market forces determine economic decisions The smartest thing for China s leaders to do is to move as quickly as possible towards a true free market system Progress is being made but we need China to pick up the pace The strength of the U S economy was built with the power of free market competitive pressure For that reason the American people thrive on competition But they will not tolerate a stacked deck Trade works when both parties compete on a level playing field But in many sectors of the Chinese economy the field is tilted against American companies and workers One of the great secrets of economic success is competition Competition Innovation Productivity Economic growth Higher standard of living WTO COMMITMENTS While China has made some progress in moving into compliance with the WTO rules we have seen a loss of momentum Earlier this year the U S Department of Commerce held roundtable discussions with U S manufacturers They raised questions about China s WTO commitments We heard complaints about Intellectual Property Rights Transparency Trading rights and distribution services Agriculture Financial services And Standards Firms doing business in China cite government protectionism and industry protectionism as the main obstacles to progress As things stand today any foreign invested enterprise doing business in China can only distribute the products that it manufacturers in China Companies can only provide after sales services for products sold by their firms AmCham China chose fourteen benchmarks to test China s WTO commitment performance As of July 19 China had only made good on two They had some progress on seven And China had problems with the other five INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS Protecting intellectual property rights is another area where reform is urgently needed We know that China s government understands the importance of IPR protections but the problems remain The Business Software Alliance estimates that software piracy rates in China exceed 90 percent It is reasonable to assume that the vast majority of the Chinese government is operating with pirated software 2 billion per year There is still a flood of counterfeit products of all types being produced and exported and consumed in China Effective protection requires criminal penalties for stolen intellectual property theft and fines large enough to be a deterrent rather than a business expense MARKET FORCES BUILD STABILITY The Bush administration believes that market forces are the most accurate and efficient mechanism to make economic decisions That means we are committed to free market principles and fair trade without subsidies or other types of government intervention As President Bush said we expect the markets to reflect the true value of currency We were glad the Chinese government agreed to create a bilateral group of experts to see how China could move more rapidly towards a genuine floating exchange rate TRANSPARENCY This is a step in the right direction Allowing market forces to influence investment decisions in China would strengthen both the U S China trade relationship and the Chinese people themselves The Chinese owned State Banks are another area of concern According to some estimates fully half of the portfolios currently held by China s banks are non performing loans Official estimates put the figure at 30 percent in the U S 1 4 The reason so many of these loans go bad is obvious There is simply no valid economic justification for many of the loans currently being extended to unprofitable businesses in China Non performing loans to state run companies are a form of government subsidy China s domestic savings are essentially funding a bubble of excess capacity China s savings are trapped in a system of indentured capital That needs to end The time to start is today Chinese savers need access to sound investment opportunities American financial institutions need access to China s market ACCELERATING PROGRESS IN CHINA America and American workers and the world have a strong interest in seeing China succeed The advantages from trade only spread when countries open their economies But when one economy is organized under principles inconsistent with that free market model friction and injury in the trading relationship are inevitable This is the central problem causing the tension over U S China trade Despite promises of openness and reform many of the main drivers in China s economy still remain in state hands U S companies face continuous pressure from our capital markets to turn a profit But free market pressure simply does not exist in China We urge the Chinese government at all levels of government to pick up the pace A true free market economy is about accountability and results and that is precisely what why we need results Thank you I ll be happy to take your questions US
