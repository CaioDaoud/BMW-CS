Library of Medicine Bethesda MD 20894 USA ABSTRACT A prototype system has been designed to automate the extraction of bibliographic data e g article title authors abstract affiliation and others from online biomedical journals to populate the National Library of Medicine s MEDLINE database This paper describes a key module in this system the labeling module that employs statistics and fuzzy rule based algorithms to identify segmented zones in an article s HTML pages as specific bibliographic data Results from experiments conducted with 1 149 medical articles from forty seven journal issues are presented Keywords HTML Online journals Labeling Fuzzy Rule Based Algorithm Statistics WebMARS NLM 1 INTRODUCTION The Lister Hill National Center for Biomedical Communications an R D division of the National Library of Medicine developed the Medical Article Records System MARS to automatically extract bibliographic data from paper based biomedical journals MARS consists of subsystems for scanning OCR page segmentation zoning labeling 1 2 and lexical analysis combined with biomedical lexicons As a production system MARS is used to routinely process hundreds of journal articles a day Since biomedical journals are increasingly appearing in electronic form available from publishers websites we see an opportunity to offset some of the disadvantages of scanning and OCR necessary for processing paper journals by going directly to the online journals We have developed a prototype system called WebMARS3 for this purpose A key subsystem in WebMARS is the WebLabeling module WLM that uses statistics and fuzzy rule based technology4 8 to identify segmented regions zones as useful bibliographic data such as title author names affiliation abstract rubric email zip code pagination grant number databank and corporate author Section 2 provides a brief system overview Section 3 presents the basic structure of the WebLabeling module Section 4 describes features used in this module and Section 5 describes a fuzzy rule based algorithm Experimental results and conclusion are in Sections 6 and 7 2 OVERVIEW OF WEBMARS In WebMARS a module named WebPageCollection downloads articles of recent journal issues from websites and saves the articles in the WebMARS database The WebLabeling module WLM then divides HTML formatted articles into several zones and labels each zone as one of ten important items of bibliographic data article title author names affiliation abstract rubric e mail zip code pagination databank accession number and grant number The LabelCleanUp module removes unnecessary tag information and reformats each zone according to conventions followed in MEDLINE fields The WebReconcile module allows an operator to check the results as a final verification step and finally the verified data is uploaded by the Upload module to the MEDLINE database 3 BASIC STRUCTURE OF THE WEBLABELING MODULE The WLM consists of three sub modules zoning labeling and updating The zoning module divides HTML formatted articles of a journal issue into several zones using tag information The labeling module labels the zones as one of the important labels such as title author affiliation abstract etc The updating module collects statistical and non statistical information from the labeling results and updates information related to the journal and important label zones in the WebMARS database In this paper we will focus on the labeling module 4 FEATURES USED IN THE LABELING MODULE Most features and rules derived for labeling are based on an analysis of the HTML formatted articles files which have extension html Both geometric and non geometric features are used A geometric feature is based on the zone order in an article For example the title zone is followed by the author affiliation abstract and other zones Non geometric features are derived from zone contents tag information and font characteristics Since the label of a zone is frequently recognized by the words it contains word matching is an important function in the automated labeling module For example a zone has a higher probability of being labeled as affiliation when it has a high proportion of words representing country city and school names Also a zone located between the words abstract and keywords has a higher probability of being labeled as abstract than other labels Seventeen word list tables are collected as shown in Table 1 and the Ternary Search Tree algorithm9 is used as the search engine for the word matching Table 1 Word List Tables used in the Labeling Module Table Name Words in the Table Rubric Review Orginal Article etc Title Words frequently used in the title zones TitleSpecial Erratum etc Author Smith John Kim etc Academic Degree Ph D MD RN etc Affiliation Words frequently used in the affiliation zones KeyAffiliation University Department Institute etc Abstract Words frequently used in the abstract zones AbstractSpecial Is are was were have

ZipCode State names with their first two digit zipcodes GrantNumber Lists of institutes of US government NIH USPHS etc with their grant codes AA DK etc Databank GenBank EMBL Embl DDBJ Ddbj The Title Author Affiliation and Abstract tables are collected from articles that were processed by MARS from May 1997 to January 2001 and the words with top 10 of the highest frequency in each table are used in this experiment TitleSpecial KeyAffiliation and AbstractSpecial tables are subsets of Title Affiliation and Abstract tables respectively and the words in the tables are collect manually The ZipCode table has 164 pairs of state names with the first two digits of U S zip codes Examples are MD Maryland 20 and MO Missouri 65 The GrantNumber table has pairs of U S government institute names and their Grant codes such as NIH AA and USPHS DK Sixty three features are extracted from each zone in the HTML formatted articles for the labeling module some of which are shown in Table 2 The Rubric table contains words describing the type of document a Review an Editorial Letters to the Editor and so forth Such words frequently appear just above the title zone This table is used to estimate Number Rubric in a zone in the sixth row in Table 2 Title in the third row in Table 1 is also used to estimate Number Title in a zone in the seventh row in Table 2 Table 2 Features used in the Labeling

algorithm Membership functions for title author affiliation abstract number of words and order of the label zone are estimated for each important label Eight different journal issues consisting of 214 articles are selected to generate membership functions In the case of title all title zones are collected from 214 articles and histograms of Ratio Title Ratio SumAuthor Ratio Affiliation Ratio Abstract Number Word and Order Zone for title are estimated For other labels the same methods are used to estimate six histograms for each label Since 214 articles are insufficient to produce smooth histogram distribution a smoothing operator averaging operator with size eleven is used to make the histograms smooth and the smoothed histograms are normalized so that the maximum value is 100 Figure 1 Procedure for generating a membership function of Ratio Affiliation for affiliation label a Histogram of Ratio Affiliation in affiliation label b Normalized smoothing result of the histogram a c Membership function of Ratio Affiliation for affiliation label a b c Figure 1 shows the procedure of generating the membership function of Ratio Affiliation for affiliation label Figure 1 a shows the histogram of data collected from the 214 articles The horizontal axis indicates Ratio Affiliation and the vertical axis indicates number of zones Figure 1 b shows the normalized histogram after smoothing the histogram in Figure 1 a fifty times with the averaging operator Figure 1 c shows membership function of Ratio Affiliation for affiliation label As shown in Figure 1 c when a zone has Ratio Affiliation more than 50 membership value of the zone is 100 Figure 2 Membership functions of affiliation label Horizontal axis indicates feature values and vertical axis indicates membership values Membership functions of a Ratio Title b Ratio SumAuthor c Ratio Affiliation d Ratio Abstract e Number Words and f Order Zone a b c d e f Figure 2 shows all six membership functions for the affiliation label Figures 2 a f are membership functions of Ratio Title Ratio SumAuthor Ratio Affiliation Ratio Abstract Number Words and Order Zone for affiliation label When a zone has following values Ratio Title 10 Ratio Author 0 Ratio Affiliation 50 Ratio Abstract 15 Number Word 30 and Order Zone 20 membership values of each function have higher values and the zone has higher probability to affiliation label as shown in Figure 2 Table 3 shows membership functions used in the labeling module Each label has six membership functions In the case of affiliation label the membership function of Ratio Title for affiliation label is described as MFaf ti and the membership function of Ratio SumAuthor for affiliation label is described as MFaf au as shown in the fourth row in the table Table 3 Membership functions used in the Labeling Module Label Feature Ratio Title Ratio SumAuthor Ratio Affiliation Ratio Abstract Number Word Order Zone Title MFti ti MFti au MFti af MFti ab MFti wo MFti or Author MFau ti MFau au MFau af MFau ab MFau wo MFau or Affiliation MFaf ti MFaf au MFaf af MFaf ab MFaf wo MFaf or Abstract MFab ti MFab au MFab af MFab ab MFab wo MFab or To estimate probability of a zone to affiliation label six features Ratio Title Ratio SumAuthor Ratio Affiliation Ratio Abstract Number Word and Order Zone are estimated from the zone to have membership values from six membership functions and a defuzzification method is used to estimate the probability from the six membership values The same method is used to estimate probabilities of title author and abstract labels 5 2 Fuzzy rules Four fuzzy rules are used to estimate the probability of a zone bearing a label such as title author affiliation and abstract labels in a zone Rule Title If Ratio Title is MFti ti and Ratio SumAuthor is MFti au and Ratio Affiliation is MFti af and Ratio Abstract is MFti ab and Number Word is MFti wo and Order Zone is MFti or the zone belongs to Title label zone Rule Author If Ratio Title is MFau ti and Ratio SumAuthor is MFau au and Ratio Affiliation is MFau af and Ratio Abstract is MFau ab and Number Word is MFau wo and Order Zone is MFau or the zone belongs to Author label zone Rule Affiliation If Ratio Title is MFaf ti and Ratio SumAuthor is MFaf au and Ratio Affiliation is MFaf af and Ratio Abstract is MFaf ab and Number Word is MFaf wo and Order Zone is MFaf or the zone belongs to Affiliation label zone Rule Abstract If Ratio Title is MFab ti and Ratio SumAuthor is MFab au and Ratio Affiliation is MFab af and Ratio Abstract is MFab ab and Number Word is MFab wo and Order Zone is MFab or the zone belongs to Abstract label zone 5 3 Defuzzification There are several aggregation operators for and Max Multiply etc Weighted sum and multiply operators are used in this experiment Since MFti ti is more important than other membership functions for Rule Title and MFau au is more important than other membership functions for Rule Author different weights are given to each membership function I e the following weights are used When we assume that feature values of a zone t are expressed as i Ratio Title t j Ratio SumAuthor t k Ratio Affiliation t l Ratio Abstract t m Number Word t and n Zone Order t the probabilities of the zone t to the four important labels are estimated as follows Rule Title PTitle t w1 MFti ti i w2 MFti au j w2 MFti af k w2 MFti ab l w2 MFti wo m MFti or n Rule Author PAuthor t w2 MFau ti i w1 MFau au j w2 MFau af k w2 MFau ab l w2 MFau wo m MFau or n Rule Affiliation PAffiliation t w2 MFaf ti i w2 MFaf au j w1 MFaf af k w2 MFaf ab l w2 MFaf wo m MFaf or n Rule Abstract PAbstract t w2 MFab ti i w2 MFab au j w2 MFab af k w1 MFab ab l w2 MFab wo m MFab or n w1 4 12 and w2 2 12 are used in this experiment Four probabilities are estimated for each zone in an article and zones with the highest probability for each label are selected for the label zone I e a zone with the highest PTitle t in an article is labeled as title and a zone with the highest PAuthor t in an article is labeled as author The same method is applied to label affiliation and abstract zones 5 4 Other rules Besides the four principal labels for bibliographic data title author affiliation and abstract other fields are of interest Different crisp rules are developed to label the rubric of the article grant number databank accession number e mail zip code pagination and corporate authors The rules for these labels also use the word matching functions to detect them However these rules are simpler than those for title author affiliation and abstract In the case of rubric when a zone contains more than one rubric word is in a common location where rubrics are normally found Order Zone and satisfies other conditions for rubric label the rule labels the zone as rubric In the case of zip code when a zone has five digit numbers the first two digit number should be relevant to the state name followed by relevant state name two digit state name or full state name and satisfies other conditions for zip code label the rule zip code labels the zone as zip code Similar rules are applied for other labels Table 4 shows abbreviated rules for other important labels Table 4 Rules for the Labeling Module Label Rules Rubric Number Rubric 0 and Number Word 4 Corporate Number Corporate 0 and Order Zone is similar to Author Grant Number Number Grant 0 and there is a word such as supported Databank Number Databank 0 and there is a word such as submitted or deposited E mail Number Email 0 and there is a word such as E mail Email etc Zip Code Number ZipCode 0 and Number Affiliation 0 Pagination Number JournalName 0 and Number Year or Month 0 and Number Volume or Issue 0 5 5 Modification of probability values Since every probability function is based on word features it needs modification of probabilities using other important features In the case of the title zone font sizes of most title zones are larger than in other zones and furthermore title zones usually have tags such as H2 or H3 Therefore probability of title PTitle t should be increased when a zone has the tags In the case of the affiliation zone probability of a zone being an affiliation PAffiliation t is also increased when the zone has many KeyAffiliation words such city and country names Therefore ratio of KeyAffilation and Affiliation words is used as weights for the adjustment of the probability It is really difficult to distinguish between abstract and other zones when there are no Abstract and Keyword in the article Therefore in the case of the abstract adjustment is focusing on relation between abstract and other important label zones I e Probability of abstract is decreased when the zone has tags H2 or H3 The probability of abstract is increased when the zone has words in the AbstractSpecial table Table 5 Test Results of the Labeling Module Label Number Error Error of each label Rubric 434 0 0 Title 1149 7 0 6 Author

Result a b c Figure 5 Example of the Labeling Result a An HTML format article b Zoning Result and c Labeling Result a b c 1 149 articles are selected from 47 journal issues picked from forty different journals and Table 3 shows the experimental results There are seven errors in title nine errors in author four errors in affiliation one error in abstract and three errors in pagination zones Figure 6 shows some examples of labeling errors In Figure 6 a the title zone Introduction has the biggest font in the article However since there is only one word in the zone and the word is usually used as a section name in journal article another zone was labeled as title In Figure 6 b there is an author zone between title and affiliation zones and the zone has author names with affiliation information The number of words related to author names is less than number of words related to affiliation Therefore a zone with more author related words is labeled as author In Figure 6 c the affiliation zone is split into three zones and the first affiliation zone The Jackson Laboratory has fewer affiliation related words than the second and third affiliation zones Therefore the labeling module labels the second and third zones as affiliation Twenty four errors are found in the 1 149 articles giving an error rate of 2 09 We conclude that the accuracy of our labeling module is 97 91 Figure 6 Examples of labeling errors in a title b author and c affiliation zones a b c 7 SUMMARY This paper describes a fuzzy rule based algorithm to label the zones bibliographic information in HTML format articles which are downloaded from websites of medical journals The proposed labeling module shows promise for analyzing the increasing number of journals that will be published electronically as HTML files The labeling module employs both geometric and non geometric features as the basis for the set of rules Experiments conducted for 1 149 journal articles show 97 91 labeling accuracy Though the test data set is not large it demonstrates the potential for large scale implementation of labeling bibliographic text in online journals Since the statistics and memberships obtained from 214 articles are not enough to process several journals the statistics should be updated from more articles Individual journal statistics such as location Order Zone and font size of each label will be collected and used to solve some exceptional labeling problems as shown in Figure 5 and to improve the computation time taken by the labeling module The weights for defuzzification are selected heuristically and work properly in this experiment However neural network algorithms such as Back Propagation will be adapted to estimate more robust weights for the labeling module REFERENCES 1 D Le J Kim G Pearson and G R
