subsidiary of Identity Clark County a private non profit organization focused on community and economic development recognized an impending implosion of voter financial support for Clark County s transportation system and elected to take on a project that enabled its citizens to dream it fund it build it The Washington State Legislature had failed to impose gas tax or other dollars to care for an aging in need of expansion transportation system and voter confidence was affecting tax measures So what to do http A grassroots effort to learn what citizens want what are they willing to pay for and how they willing to pay for it was designed and taken out into the community A series of 32 smaller community meetings led to five larger community forums all of which led to a community wide all day summit over a short three month time period Along the way citizens were provided education and information on how transportation works from concept to design to construction As they learned their perceptions of transportation changed somewhat which told us that education was certainly a key to understanding and support of transportation issues In addition we learned that people care deeply what happens in their neighborhoods and see fixing travel around the County and to and from Oregon as a priority and if people know their money will be spent on local projects and there is an accountability factor they are willing to pay for it The result of the project is a report to the community jurisdictions citizens and legislators which includes a list of recommendations and how we got there The model we used which was to some extent a design as you go process worked beautifully and could work equally well for a multitude of issues We still don t have all the answers but are currently designing Transportation Priorities Project Phase II which will lead us to most of the answers the bottom line being what will be supported when voters go to the polls The Project On this
