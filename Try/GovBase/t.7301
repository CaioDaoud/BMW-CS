NGS Monitoring the Solar Storm of October 29 30 2003 GPS data from the CORS network can be used to provide a detailed model of the ionosphere over the continental United States The movie shown here is for the time period from Oct 28 to Oct 30 2003 during which enormous solar flares in the sun s corona induced large fluctuations in the earth s ionosphere These fluctuations are expressed in TEC units for Total Electron Content a measure of the amount of ionization in the upper regions of the earth s atmosphere The movie begins one day before the storm to better illustrate it s intensity The date and universal time are displayed at the top of the frame The quiet night time ionosphere is clearly visible each day however the day time ionospheres on the 2nd and 3rd days is dramatically different from that of the 1st day These results were computed using the modeling program known as MAGIC developed under an NGS post doctoral grant to Paul Spencer in cooperation with the NOAA Space Environment Center and the joint NOAA University of Colorado Cooperative Institute for Research in Enviromental Sciences CIRES For more information please contact cgi test redirectNOAA u Gerald L Mader Gerry Mader PUBS LIB avi storm avi View the AVI movie Back to NGS Home page
