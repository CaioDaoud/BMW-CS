to develop security guidelines and appoint a security representative Terminals have large quantities of hazardous materials and present an easy target for vandals and terrorists to scope out an operation and find its weak links Transportation companies have fewer options when security is an issue however they must be vigilant in their efforts to secure their loads Working together we ALL can make a difference in the security of hazardous materials and the protection of those around us Common Security Issues Hazardous materials left in open yard Hazardous materials not routinely
