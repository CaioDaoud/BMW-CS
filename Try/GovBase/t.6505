Navagation Image Spacer Image Spacer Image Spacer Image Spacer Image Spacer Image Astrobiology Technologies Thousands of sensors ranging from fingernail size to matchbook size exist that can support a wide range of measurements including pH chemical composition and concentration temperature pressure partial pressure gravity acceleration elemental abundances spectral characteristics etc Most have been developed for other applications so they need to be tailored and adapted for Astrobiology We must start now to enable utilization of these technologies in 2 3 year time frame Also need to consider sensor arrays and groups to obtain data from multiple parameters simultaneously A critical problem is in getting the sample to the sensor and all handling management issues therein Some examples include Leading Technologies Smaller Spacecraft and http es epa gov ncerqa abstracts sbir other monana xu html Miniaturized Environmental Sensors Chemical laboratories that enable multiple analyses even sequential analyses of a single sample can fit on a compact disk There are also other techniques and methods of doing the same that are at generally the same level of readiness pre

Techniques Mass spectrometers ion mobility spectrometers gas chromatographs imaging systems in wavelengths spanning gamma ray through infrared are available within a soda can to shoebox volume These can be miniaturized further Examples http web99 arc nasa gov 80 reports 1995 kojiro html Ion Mobility Spectra of Unresolved Gas Chromatographic Peaks Instrument suites can be developed to fit within the envelope of a soda can but require further development to effectively realize this potential Cell and microbial culture and preservation facilities suitable for early Space Station were identified that could fit within the volume of a hockey puck Even spacecraft can be miniaturized DS2 is an outstanding example of this philosophy http nmp jpl nasa gov ds2 Mars Microprobe Project Development of sample management systems is urgently needed A critical finding is that the state of the art of sample management sample acquisition preparation distribution and preservation is seriously deficient and precludes the use of the vast array of capabilities available in miniaturized analytical instrumentation This is a common problem in DARPA and in the biotech community as well as in NASA It is recommended that the next technology NRA specifically address this problem Autonomous or remotely operated biolabs in situ AROBIS are recommended for research in hydrothermal vents subterranean systems deep drilling planetary bodies These should combine intelligent mechanism robotics and measurement technologies to provide a powerful multidisciplinary attack on characterizing sites for habitability chemical evolution and life Related Links http img arc nasa gov Intelligent Mechanisms Group and http img arc nasa gov TROV trov press release html Antarctic to Become Laboratory for Future Mars Missions Hyperspectral imaging and analysis systems for remote midrange and in situ studies of planetary bodies is recommended for development Applications of these technologies would preserve spatial features with the chemical and environmental data to enable selections among in situ examination strategies based on real time analysis Specific instrument and algorithm development is needed to coordinate imaging and environmental data build in the capacity to analyze information per pixel apply adaptive analytical techniques and harden for planetary exploration DARPA industry partnership opportunities are excellent Relate link http www techexpo com WWW opto knowledge IS resources html OPTO KNOWLEDGE SYSTEMS Inc Technologies that enable evolutionary biology studies and organism environment interface characterization are recommended for Space Station These technologies would enable the first definitive qualitative and quantitative molecular biology examinations of a wide range of terrestrial species characterization of terrestrial evolution beyond Earth and examination of co evolution of life and the environment issues Direct microscopic imaging capability is recommended Remote or autonomous operation of imaging systems in wide range of spectra resolution and amplification would provide a powerful new tool for in situ examination of planetary bodies Related systems would have broad applications to Space Station These systems should include intelligent analysis for autonomous operation that meet low bandwidth constraints Gas Grain Simulation

the environment issues See http www mainsgate com hw db Astrobiology Life Sciences Hardware Database CONCLUSION The current and projected state of the art can provide an impressive arsenal of tools for Astrobiology research on the remarkable set mission opportunities planned over the next decade Executed correctly these tools and techniques can help characterize the organic history and composition of other worlds find sources of liquid water and enable sophisticated searches for extant and extinct life in extreme environments throughout the solar system Joint development and collaborations with industry NSF NIH NOAA DOE DARPA and others can provide cost effective solutions to common problems reduce the development cost and provide fresh practical perspectives on
