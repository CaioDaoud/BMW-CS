countries has been responsible for about 95 of the world s energy R D investments The energy R D enterprises of these countries embody to a large extent the capability for future technological changes in the world s energy systems Recently each of these countries reduced its public and private sector investments in energy R D in some cases by more than 70 Given fewer resources firms and governments find themselves compelled increasingly to make difficult tradeoffs between technology areas and between long and short term research projects The changes and new directions for energy R D investment and their consequences are thoroughly analyzed in the reports available from this site International and country specific trends in energy policy and investment provide information and guidance to policy makers technology managers and others seeking to alter or reverse current energy R D investment patterns Such information will affect the understanding of and approach to issues of worldwide climate change Because the widespread and growing use of fossil fuels is responsible in large part for rising global greenhouse gas emissions addressing climate change will require the development and deployment of new energy technologies that are less carbon intensive The research presented here was conducted by the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory as part of the http www pnl gov bsap index
