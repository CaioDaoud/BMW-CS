Codes Available from the Nuclear Information Service Codes Available from the Nuclear Information Service The computer codes available here are used by our Group and around the world for preparing nuclear data libraries for applications in nuclear technology and nuclear engineering They are also useful to support research programs doing nuclear physics measurements transx index html TRANSX 2 TRANSX is a code for preparing data tables for nuclear transport codes from cross section libraries in MATXS format This area contains all the files needed to update your current version to 2 15 The original source file is not included You should obtain a formal release of the code from one of the distribution centers for example RSICC The TRANSX2 report will be found in the publications publications html Publications section of the Information Service A transx hyper HELP html HyperText help package is also available This version of TRANSX features improved compatibility with the ORNL styles codes such as ANISN and a capability to work from a directory of single material files rather than the large multi material files that have been used traditionally See the codes transx Readme 15 Readme 15 file for more details njoy91 index html NJOY 91 The NJOY Nuclear Data Processing System is used to prepare cross section libraries for a wide variety of applications from evaluated nuclear data in ENDF format This area contains the key files needed to update NJOY91 to 91 118 The original source file is not included You should obtain a formal release of the code from one of the distribution centers for example RSIC See the codes njoy91 README118 README118 file for more details njoy94 index html NJOY 94 This section provides user support for NJOY 94 which is available from RSICC NJOY 94 includes all the capabilities of NJOY 91 118 a new direct to Postscript plotting system an updated version of the PURR module and the new LEAPR module for computing thermal scattering functions A number of updates have been made since the initial release of NJOY94 including a new gas production capability color Postscript graphics changes in the MCNP section high energy capabilities a modified version of WIMSR new arithmetic routines and portability improvements The link above leads to a directory containing the codes njoy94 Readme105 README file for 94 105 the set of updates that we have accumulated since the release of 94 0 the current versions of the machine dependent update files and makefiles for several systems the current test problem input and output files and three Postscript files demonstrating the output of the new plotting system The NJOY source file must be obtained from one of the distribution centers for example RSICC ryxm lanl gov njoy97 index html NJOY 97 This section provides user support such as code updates for NJOY 97 It is a cleaned up version of NJOY 94 105 with both F77 and F90 compatibility It has been explicitly double precisioned so as to run equally well on 32 bit and 64 bit machines NJOY 97 runs on many different unix workstations including linux and we now have a DOS version also For more information on the code installation instructions etc see njoy97 Readme0 Readme0 For changes up through 97 115 see njoy97 Readme115 Readme115 A njoy index html tutorial on NJOY 97 is also available ryxm lanl gov njoy99 index html NJOY 99 NJOY 99 is the latest release of the NJOY Nuclear Data Processing System It is a cleaned up version of NJOY 97 with more progress towards Fortran 90 style block constructs but it still contains lots of statement numbers The bulk of the changes are in the ACER module to support high energy cross sections outgoing charged particles incident charged particles and photonuclear data These new features are important for users of MCNP 4c and MCNPX This version has good portability between machines and it has been tested thoroughly on Sun SGI Origen 2000 Linux g77 and Portland Group pgf90 and DOS Lahey LF95 and Absoft f90 For more information on the code installation instructions etc see njoy99 Readme0 Readme0 This area is only to supply user support such as updates and sample problem outputs To obtain an official package of NJOY99 including the source contact one of the code centers RSICC NEA Data Bank etc ryxm lanl gov http t2 lanl gov Return to the T 2 Nuclear Information Service page 23 January 2002 ryxm lanl gov
