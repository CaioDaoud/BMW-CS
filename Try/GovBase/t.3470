FX Linux FX Linux To demonstrate a technology path for evolution of the National Weather Service s NWS Advanced Weather Interactive Processing System AWIPS FSL began an publications 17th IIPS 01 Davis et al IIPS01 html effort to port the D2D Display 2 Dimensions code to run under Linux on a commodity PC in 1999 In late 2000 the NWS fielded the first demonstration systems and delivered two PC based Linux forecaster workstations to each of its field offices in early 2002 FSL has continued its Linux development work including porting the data ingest decoding subsystem An updated publications EGOWS 01 Grote EGOWS01 html description of this work was prepared in mid 2001 Elsewhere PRC Inc under contract to NWS has developed a Linux version of the communications processor that provides the interface between the satellite broadcast and FSL s decoders This is currently being tested at PRC NWS headquarters and FSL The diagram below prepared by NWS approximates the current test configuration Current work at FSL includes exploration of new network technology including a multicast of the data to the user workstations and some experiments with a high availability cluster for failover management Recent testing at FSL has included using one preprocessor PP1 to ingest and decode satellite images and grids Other data are still being ingested by the old HPRT Communications Processor The following notes are provided by NWS keyed to the numbers on their diagram acq client feeds incoming grid data to instances of acqserver running on both PP1 and PP2 Grid acquisition and storage processes from acqserver acqdata to GribDecoder run in parallel on both PP1 and PP2 Grid data stored redundantly in netCDF format on local disks on each node The data fxa hierarchy is visible to software on both DS nodes both AS nodes and all workstations The data fxa Grid subhierarchy actually resides on PP1 and PP2 duplicate copies Details for implementing this remain TBD Issue To limit the interruption of operations that might be caused by the failure of one of the PPs we have the grid ingest processes running in parallel on both That will cause the notification server to receive two notifications of each incoming product one from each GribDecoder Page maintained by mailto joseph s wakefield noaa gov Joe Wakefield Last updated 23 May 02
