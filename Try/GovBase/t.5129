hc html Health Consultation ma html Media Announcement map This site is located at 603 Fenton Lane West Chicago Dupage County Illinois Former W R Grace Company Site West Chicago Illinois Site Background From 1974 to the early 1990 s the former W R Grace Company facility at 603 Fenton Lane in West Chicago Illinois processed vermiculite mined in Libby Montana This vermiculite was contaminated with asbestos The facility exfoliated popped or expanded vermiculite which could then be used to manufacture other products The West Chicago plant processed over 273 000 tons of vermiculite W R Grace closed the facility in 1996 and sold the 6 4 acre site to Royal Corinthian in 1998 Royal Corinthian manufactures marble columns and rails inside the former processing building Land use immediately surrounding the site is primarily commercial and light industrial Currently the nearest residential area is approximately one half mile east of the site According to the U S Census over 3 000 people were living within one mile of the site in 1990 which is around the time the plant stopped exfoliating Libby vermiculite The ground around the building is paved but much of the rest of site is undeveloped Recent EPA sampling results indicated a trace amount of residual Libby asbestos in the soil Samples collected by W R Grace in 1996 showed that Libby asbestos levels in the air inside the building were well below levels that would be a health concern Some information about the air sample results is missing and should be obtained if possible to confirm this conclusion No vermiculite or vermiculite waste stockpiles are present at the site Conclusions and Recommendations Former Workers Conclusion Former workers at the W R Grace plant were exposed to hazardous levels of asbestos People who lived with former workers were probably also exposed to hazardous levels from fibers carried home on workers hair and clothing Recommendation Identify former W R Grace workers and their household contacts people who lived with them to evaluate potential health effects Current Workers Conclusion Under current conditions and assuming only occasional contact with soil that contains Libby asbestos onsite exposure of workers to contaminated soils does not appear to pose a public health hazard Based on historical air sample results the facility appeared to have been cleaned so the levels of asbestos in air do not appear to pose a public health hazard Recommendation Provide independent confirmation that current workers inside the building are not being exposed to hazardous levels of Libby asbestos Past Community Conclusion Currently not enough data are available to determine whether people who lived near the plant were exposed to hazardous levels of Libby asbestos Recommendation Review new information that becomes available to determine appropriate actions to protect public health Present Community Conclusion Community exposure to Libby asbestos from plant emissions or from onsite asbestos contaminated materials poses no public health hazard Not enough information is available however to determine whether individuals are being exposed to Libby asbestos through direct contact with waste that may have been used in the community In other communities waste vermiculite has been used for a variety of purposes such as fill driveway surfacing or soil amendments Recommendation Review new information that becomes available to determine appropriate actions to protect public health Consumer Products ATSDR did not evaluate products that contain Libby vermiculite such as vermiculite attic insulation as part of this project Information concerning vermiculite consumer products is available on ATSDR s Web site at NEWS vermiculite051603 html www
