School Year 2004 05 At their November meeting the Board of Regents will consider two approaches for its 2004 2005 school aid proposal 1 continuing and building upon recent State Aid proposals and 2 a foundation formula approach with a mandated local effort requirement The foundation formula would set forth an amount to support the basic education of a pupil and a standard of local support in terms of a tax rate and calculates the amount of local support that each district would collect if it actually imposed this specified tax rate State Aid would provide the difference between the foundation amount and that which the school district would raise with this tax rate The Regents will deliberate in November and agree upon an approach to pursue A full proposal will be developed for approval by the Regents in December 11 6 03 osa Important 20Notices graphcalculatorsuse htm Use of Graphing Calculators on the Regents Math A Examination Information on the use of graphing calculators on Math A
