regarding complaints against a school you may contact the Better Business Bureau the school s accrediting agency and the Missouri Attorney General Will my coursework transfer If your plans include

therefore you must contact the institution you plan to attend to ask about the types of coursework they will accept What information is available from the school Call the school and request a catalog Read it carefully The catalog should give you a basic understand of the school the programs tuition and fees facilities and equipment and policies and procedures If there is anything you don t understand make a list of questions to ask a school representative Can I visit the school The most important step in making an informed decision is to visit the school before you enroll Make an appointment to talk with school representatives This is a suggested list of questions but always ask for explanation of anything you don t understand What are the school s admissions standards and application procedures How long is the program What skills are taught How much of the program is lecture and how much is hands on training Does the program include any on the job training How much does the program cost What is included in the cost of tuition Are there any additional costs such as supplies books equipment registration fees application fees uniforms if applicable materials kits graduation fees or student association fees Does the school offer financial assistance or a payment plan What is the school s policy regarding grades attendance conduct and dress Is there a formal procedure for handling student complaints Of the students who start the program how many graduate Of the students who graduate from the program how many are working in their chosen fields What kind of placement assistance is available Take a tour of the facilities and sit in on a class Notice the ratio of students per teacher in the classrooms Is there enough space and equipment for all students While you are in the classrooms take the opportunity to talk with students about their experiences at the school Do they like the program How do they feel about the instructors How much time do they spend on homework outside the classroom Is there a contract If you decide to attend the school certified to operate by this agency you will probably sign an enrollment agreement upon acceptance to the school This is the legally binding contract between you and the school The school agrees to provide the program of instruction and the other services as outlined in the catalog In return you agree to pay a certain sum of money and abide by the rules and regulations of the school Read the entire document thoroughly before you sign and do not sign unless you understand all the provisions it contains
