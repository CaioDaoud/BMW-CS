USGS Hawaiian Volcano Observatory Hawaiian Volcano Observatory perched on rim of Kilauea Caldera The Hawaiian Volcano Observatory HVO enjoys a world wide reputation as a leader in the study of active volcanism Due to their usually benign natures Kilauea and Mauna Loa the most active volcanoes on the Island of Hawai i can be studied up close in relative safety While observations made by 19th century missionaries and travelers constitute a large part of the early and colorful history of volcano watching in Hawai i HVO s origins are rooted in a desire to use scientific methodology to understand the nature of volcanic processes and to reduce their risks to society http wwwhvo wr usgs gov observatory 24dshvo03 caption html Aerial view of HVO on rim of Kilauea Caldera Hawai i HVO

Volcano Hazards Program of the U S Geological Survey Our staff conducts research on the volcanoes of Hawai i and works with emergency response officials to protect people and property from earthquakes and volcano related hazards We work to reduce the risks from these hazards in the following ways http wwwhvo wr usgs gov observatory 24dsgeo8 caption html Geologist on rim of Pu u O o cone Kilauea

Defense Communicating results of our studies with the public emergency managers educators and students through the media presentations and workshops field trips and the USGS Volunteer Program Knowledge of past eruptions and earthquakes and careful monitoring of ongoing activity form the basis of our current hazard assessments in Hawai i and our studies of volcanic and seismic processes By keeping abreast of what is happening and by knowing what has happened we can coexist with Hawai i s active volcanoes living working and playing on them and minimizing their dangers to people and property Our current work is focused on the following subject areas link group 3 skip past bottom navigational bar http hvo wr usgs gov observatory work html gas Gas geochemistry Geophysics http hvo

Observatory HVO has a long and complex history much of which was summarized by Russell Apple retired National Park Service historian to celebrate the 75th anniversary of its founding by Thomas Jaggar in 1912 Russ has kindly given us permission to quote in full his http hvo wr usgs gov observatory hvo history html historical essay which appeared in USGS Professional Paper 1350 a collection of mostly technical papers about Hawai i published in 1987 and edited by Bob Decker Tom Wright and Peter Stauffer Russ essay stands out in its accuracy and readability and we recommend it to anyone interested in understanding the flavor of HVO particularly during the first half of the 20th century Tribute to a friend and colleague Reginald Reggie T Okamura beloved Chief of Operations of the Hawaiian Volcano Observatory from 1958 1992 died peacefully in his sleep at Hilo Medical Center on January 16 1999 Reggie began his career at HVO as a Physical Science Technician in 1958 after receiving a degree in entomology with a minor in chemistry at the University of Hawaii at Manoa In 1978 he became Chief of Operations a position he held until his retirement in 1992 http hvo wr usgs
