Lo ihi Seamount northwest from a perspective high above and to the southeast of the Island of Hawai i green Lo ihi Seamount is in bottom center of image Lo ihi Seamount is an active volcano built on the seafloor south of Kilauea about 30 km from shore The seamount rises to 969 m below sea level and generates frequent earthquake swarms the most intense of which occurred in 1996 An eruption at Lo ihi has yet to be observed but scientists from the University of Hawai i have recently made many submersible dives to the volcano and deployed instruments on its summit to study Lo ihi in much greater detail The summit of Lo ihi is marked by a caldera like depression 2 8 km wide and 3 7 km long Three collapse pits or craters occupy the southern part of the caldera the most recent pit formed during an intense earthquake swarm in July August 1996 Named Pele s Pit the new crater is about 600 m in diameter and its bottom is 300 m below the previous surface Like the volcanoes on the Island of Hawaii Lo ihi has grown from eruptions along its 31 km long rift zone that extends northwest and southeast of the caldera Lo ihi Seamount Information http www soest hawaii edu GG HCV loihi html Lo ihi page

northern base is 1 900 m below sea level whereas its southern base is 4 755 m below sea level Thus the summit is about 931 m above the seafloor as measured from the base of its north flank and 3 786 m
