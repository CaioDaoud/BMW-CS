angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer MISR during October and November 2003 The two images represent about 310 kilometers x 141 kilometers left panel and 310 x 184 kilometers right panel This mystery concerns two coral atoll ecosystems located in different parts of the globe Use any reference materials you like to answer the following 4 questions 1 Three of these four statements about the geomorphology of the coral reefs are true Which one is false A Their modern shape has been influenced by sea level changes over geologic timescales B The reefs have grown over millions of years atop ancient volcanic mountain ranges C Unless there is too much sediment present in the water some of the reefs can grow at depths of up to 170 meters D The reefs tend to grow in density and thickness where the water flow is greatest due to prevailing ocean currents 2 Three of the following four statements accurately describe coral atoll ecosystems Which one does not A Other living organisms besides coral help to build the atolls through calcium carbonate production B Symbiotic zooxanthellae provide reef corals with the calcium and nutrients they need to grow C Atolls can be very open entirely closed or have a number of entry points by which a lagoon area is open to the ocean D The diversity and abundance of corals is greater along the protected inner atoll and lagoon areas than along the outer reef slopes 3 Three of these four statements about the atolls of the left hand image are true Which one is false A The many small saucer shaped reef structures within the lagoonal areas make this reef system different from all others B The word atoll is a term that comes from a language native to this region and has been expanded for use worldwide C The two largest cities in these atolls are home to about 8000 people each D At one atoll construction of an artificial reef began in November 2001 4 Three of these four statements about the atolls of the right hand image are true Which one is false A In this region the prevailing ocean current or swell comes from the south B The chemical character of the inner lagoons is not significantly influenced by the size of the openings in the reef rims C Within the image area there is a designated biosphere reserve and breeding grounds for at least 3 species of sea turtle D The most extensive freshwater is found at the small round green atoll that appears along the left hand image edge See quiz 2003 nov 19a html answers E mail your answers name initials are acceptable if you prefer and your hometown by the quiz
