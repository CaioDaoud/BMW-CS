NOAA Aeronomy Lab Effects of aircraft on the atmosphere Effects of aircraft on the atmosphere At the Aeronomy Laboratory scientists are conducting field theoretical and laboratory studies of how exhaust from aircraft influences the atmosphere Several of the Program Areas are involved Meteorological Chemistry Middle Atmosphere Atmospheric Chemical Kinetics and Theoretical Aeronomy Air travel is at an all time high and demand for aviation services is expected to continue to rise in the coming few decades Currently most of the world s air travel occurs on subsonic below the speed of sound aircraft that fly primarily in the upper troposphere A portion however occurs via supersonic aircraft flying at higher altitudes This includes military flights as well as the flights of what is presently the only commercial supersonic aircraft the Concorde For both subsonic and supersonic aircraft there are many questions about how the exhaust gases and particles might influence the atmosphere The emissions of nitrogen oxides carbon dioxide water vapor and other substances are of interest because they either directly or indirectly relate to the greenhouse effect In addition there is a particular emphasis on understanding supersonic aircraft effects because 1 those flights occur in the lower stratosphere where the ozone layer may be affected and 2 several nations of the world are considering future expansions of their supersonic fleets and so any atmospheric effects would be expected to be amplified The Aeronomy Laboratory is working closely with scientists from around the world on studies of this issue Carrying out field studies to characterize the dynamics and chemistry of the stratosphere so that effects of proposed fleets of supersonic aircraft can be predicted Recent field work has included extensive participation in the NASA led program known as Measurements of the Atmospheric Effects of Supersonic Aircraft MAESA Conducted in close coordination with the Airborne Southern Hemisphere Ozone Experiment this 1994 field campaign used instrumentation aboard the NASA ER 2 research aircraft to gather chemical and meteorological data in the stratosphere from the northern midlatitudes to the Antarctic Analysis of data from those flights is in progress The Aeronomy Lab participated in a NASA led program known as Stratospheric Tracers of Atmospheric Transport STRAT Again using the ER 2 platform scientists from the Aeronomy Lab other NOAA labs NASA and several other agencies and universities gathered data to characterize the transport properties of the stratosphere across a wide range of latitudes and seasons The data are enabling scientists to better understand how supersonic aircraft exhaust would be distributed around the globe See StratO3 html STRAT more on STRAT in the previous section on stratospheric ozone Conducting laboratory and theoretical studies related to the effects of aircraft on the atmosphere Aircraft emissions include not only gases but particles Furthermore some of the gases in the exhaust are transformed into particles in the wake of the aircraft Interactions between particles and gases so called heterogeneous chemistry is recognized as an important frontier area of atmospheric science For example particles have been shown to enhance the abundances of chemicals that cause the Antarctic ozone hole and volcanoes contribute gases that increase the amount of particles in the atmosphere above the normal background amount with the result that the chemistry of the atmosphere is altered The Aeronomy Laboratory s Atmospheric Chemical Kinetics and Middle Atmosphere programs are providing many of the laboratory measurements and modeling studies that are needed to understand the basics of the atmosphere s heterogeneous processes so that effects of additional particles from aircraft can be assessed and anticipated Working with colleagues in the NASA sponsored program known as Atmospheric Effects of Aviation Project AEAP This program is developing a state of the science assessment of our current scientific understanding about how supersonic and subsonic aircraft influence the atmosphere Two Aeronomy Lab scientists were among the ten scientists who were lead authors of the 1995 Scientific Assessment of the Atmospheric Effects of Stratospheric Aircraft That report examines the status of our knowledge concerning the impact of proposed high speed civil transport supersonic aircraft on the atmosphere The assessment was developed under the Atmospheric Effects of Stratospheric Aircraft AESA element of NASA s High Speed Research Program HSRP The Aeronomy Laboratory has been and will continue to be a major contributor to these assessment activities Working with international colleagues on the 1999 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change IPCC special report on Aviation and the Global Atmosphere Aeronomy Lab scientists are playing key roles in planning authoring and reviewing this special report The report will provide a firm scientific foundation for understanding how projected increases in air travel including proposed expansions of supersonic aircraft fleets could influence the atmosphere A RESEARCH HIGHLIGHT Measuring the exhaust of a supersonic aircraft For the first time the exhaust plume of a supersonic transport aircraft was sampled while it was actually in flight in the stratosphere at speeds in excess of the speed of sound Some of what scientists found was expected but other results were quite surprising These direct measurements will allow scientists to better judge the potential impact of such aircraft on the ozone layer For more detail Aircraft2 html read on The NASA ER 2 research aircraft and the supersonic
