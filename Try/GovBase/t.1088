MISR Multi Angle Imaging Spetrometer Earth Atmosphere statellite NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory MISR the Multiangle Imaging SpectroRadiometer is an instrument that will image Earth s climate system simultaneously at 9 different angles MISR was built for NASA by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena California It is part of NASA s Terra spacecraft MISR Home NASA home page http www nasa gov

Pioneering New Directions in Earth Observation Providing a New Way of Looking at Our Planet Exploring New Angles on the Global Environment Charting New Pathways in Climate Research mission miview1 html MISR Instrument No instrument like MISR has flown in space before Viewing the sunlit Earth simultaneously at nine widely spaced angles MISR provides ongoing global coverage with high spatial detail Its imagery is carefully calibrated to provide accurate measures of the brightness contrast and color of reflected sunlight MISR provides new types of information for scientists studying Earth s climate such as the partitioning of energy and carbon between the land surface and the atmosphere and the regional and global impacts of different types of atmospheric particles and clouds on climate The change in reflection at different view angles affords the means to distinguish different types of atmospheric particles aerosols cloud forms and land surface covers Combined with stereoscopic techniques this enables construction of 3 D models and estimation of the total amount of sunlight reflected by Earth s diverse environments http eosweb larc nasa gov Access MISR data

eclipse where an observer on Earth can watch the Moon s shadow obscure more than 90 the Sun s disk the Multiangle Imaging SpectroRadiometer MISR captured these views of the Antarctic surface during the total solar eclipse of November 23 2003 The path of the Moon s umbral shadow began in the Indian Ocean in the far Southern Hemisphere and passed over parts of the Queen Maud and Wilkes Lands in Eastern Antarctica In this set of images the darkness of the shadow is clearly increasing over the 7 minutes that it takes for all of MISR s nine cameras to view a scene These nine images progress from the most forward pointing camera far left through to the most backward pointing camera far right cover the same geographic area and have been processed identically The area covered by the nine MISR swaths begins at the Antarctic coastline about 66 S 140 E near the French station Dumont d Urville and ends at about 77 S 32 E in Queen Maud Land The increasing darkness in the center part of the images relates to the approach to the time of maximum eclipse http sunearth gsfc nasa gov eclipse TSE2003 TSE2003gif TSE2003 3b GIF This detailed map indicates the position and time of maximum eclipse

and 82 south latitude These data products were generated from a portion of the imagery acquired during Terra orbit 20920 The panels cover an area of about 380 kilometers x 2909 kilometers and utilize data from blocks 146 to 170 within World Reference System 2 path76 MISR was built and is managed by NASA s Jet Propulsion Laboratory Pasadena CA for NASA s Office of Earth Science Washington DC The
