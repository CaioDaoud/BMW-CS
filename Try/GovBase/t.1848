November for the Atlantic 15 May 30 November for the Eastern Pacific Current tropical cyclone forecast track and danger area for each system is depicted as the shaded region in the graphic Danger area is determined by adding 100 200 300 nautical miles to the 24 48 72 hour forecast position and maximum 34 knot wind radii respectively The values used in determining danger areas are based on the latest 10 year average error in forecast tracks issued by the NHC The TPC does not warrant that avoiding these danger areas will eliminate the risk of harm from tropical cyclones Users operating in the vicinity of these systems are advised to continually monitor the latest Forecast Advisories from the NHC and proceed at their own risk The danger area will not be depicted from tropical cyclones
