continues through December 8 2003 During this time eligible employees can elect to enroll in a Health Care FSA HCFSA and or a Dependent Care FSA DCFSA These accounts are set up on a plan year basis i e January 1 through December 31 The FSA plan year will begin on January 1 2004 and end on December 31 2004 YOU MUST ENROLL FOR THE 2004 PLAN YEAR EVEN IF YOU ALREADY HAVE AN ACCOUNT FOR THE 2003 PLAN YEAR WHAT IS FSA A Flexible Spending Account is an employee benefit that allows you to set aside money on a pre tax basis for certain kinds of common expenses With an FSA you can reduce your taxes while paying for services you would have to pay for anyway This new program will provide two FSAs A Health Care FSA HCFSA that allows pre tax reimbursement of eligible medical costs not covered or reimbursed by insurance Expenses that may be reimbursed under an HCFSA would be tax deductible related to the diagnosis treatment or cure of a medical condition or mitigation or prevention of disease that affects any part or function of the body primarily to alleviate or prevent a physical or mental defect or illness not reimbursed by your FEHB carrier or any other source and incurred by you and or any dependent you claim on your Federal income tax return Insurance premiums of any kind i e non FEHB coverage Federal Long Term Care Insurance Medicare Part B Tricare etc do not qualify for reimbursement FEHB premiums are already deducted pre tax through premium conversion A Dependent Care FSA DCFSA allows participants to be reimbursed on a pre tax basis for child care or adult dependent care expenses that are necessary to allow you and if married your spouse to work seek work or for your spouse to attend school full time Eligible family members include A child up to age 13 and or A person of any age whom you claim as a dependent on your Federal income tax return and who is mentally or physically incapable of caring for himself or herself HOW DOES AN FSA WORK FIRST you need to determine how much money to allot on an annual basis and make your election s SECOND the DHHS Payroll Office will deduct equal installments of the annual allotment you elect This allotment will be deposited into your FSA account s THIRD when you incur an eligible expense you will pay for it out of pocket and then submit a claim for reimbursement FINALLY your claim will be processed and you will be reimbursed WHO IS ELIGIBLE If you are currently eligible for FEHB even if you are not currently enrolled you will be able to elect a HCFSA to cover expenses not covered under your FEHB plan or any other insurance All employees with qualified dependents may elect to enroll in the DCFSA except temporary employees with no fixed work schedule whose tour of duty is six months or less I AM ELIGIBLE HOW MUCH CAN I CONTRIBUTE For the HCFSA you may elect a maximum of 3 000 per plan year i e January through December For the DCFSA an annual maximum of 5 000 may be elected For both benefits the minimum election must be 250 The allotments will be made before Federal state and social security taxes are calculated You can draw upon your FSA account for reimbursement as you incur eligible expenses Possible forfeitures Because of the tax advantages of FSAs the IRS has strict guidelines for its use One of these guidelines is commonly known as the use it or lose it rule Put simply if you have not incurred enough eligible expenses during the plan year to equal the annual amount you have contributed to their FSA s you will lose the balance remaining in your account s when the plan year ends Also if you resign during the plan year and you have not incurred enough eligible expenses you will lose the balance remaining HOW DO I ENROLL You will voluntarily enroll directly with SHPS SHPS
