Geodetic Glossary National Geodetic Survey National Ocean Service National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Rockville MD September 1986 pp 54 defines geodetic datum as A set of constants specifying the coordinate system used for geodetic control i e for calculating the coordinates of points on the Earth The datum as defined in 1 together with the coordinate system and the set of all points and lines whose coordinates lengths and directions have been determined by measurement or calculation These differing definitions require caution when using the word datum The first definition makes datum synonymous with the selection of a reference coordinate system origin and orientation The second definition makes datum synonymous with a list of coordinates of the control points When the first definition is used the published coordinates of control points can change when better measurements allow better determinations With the second definition a change in coordinates should result in a new datum NGS has used the first definition for NAD 1983 What are NAD 27 and NAD 83 The North American Datum of 1927 NAD 27 is The horizontal control datum for the United States that was defined by a location and azimuth on the Clarke spheroid of 1866 with origin at the survey station Meades Ranch The geoidal height at Meades Ranch was assumed to be zero Geodetic positions on the North American Datum of 1927 were derived from the coordinates of and an azimuth at Meades Ranch through a readjustment of the triangulation of the entire network in which Laplace azimuths were introduced and the Bowie method was used Geodetic Glossary pp 57 The North American Datum of 1983 NAD 83 is The horizontal control datum for the United States Canada Mexico and Central America based on a geocentric origin and the Geodetic Reference System 1980 This datum designated as NAD 83 is the new geodetic reference system NAD 83 is based on the adjustment of 250 000 points including 600 satellite Doppler stations which constrain the system to a geocentric origin Geodetic Glossary pp 57 Why did NGS change from NAD 27 to NAD 83 NAD 83 was computed by the geodetic agencies of Canada Federal and Provincial and the National Geodetic Survey for several reasons The horizontal control networks had expanded piecemeal since 1933 to cover much more of the countries and it was very difficult to add new surveys to the network without altering large areas of the previous network Field observations had added thousands of accurate Electronic Distance Measuring Instrument EDMI base lines hundreds of additional points with astronomic coordinates and azimuths and hundreds of Doppler satellite determined positions It was also recognized that the Clarke Ellipsoid of 1866 no longer served the needs of a modern geodetic network For an in depth explanation see NOAA Professional Paper NOS 2 The North American Datum of 1983 Charles R Schwarz Editor National Geodetic Survey Rockville MD 20852 December 1989 What is the relationship between the geodetic vertical datums NGVD 29 and or NAVD 88 and the various water level tidal datums NGS develops and maintains the current national geodetic vertical datum NAVD 88 In addition NGS provides the relationships between past and current geodetic vertical datums e g NGVD 29 and NAVD 88 However another part of our parent organization NOS National Ocean Service is the Center for Operational Oceanographic Products and Services CO OPS CO OPS publishes tidal bench mark information and the relationship between NAVD 88 and various water level tidal datums e g Mean Lower Low Water Mean High Water Mean Tide Level etc The relationships to NGVD 29 are not published but may be calculated independently from specified tidal bench mark sheet links to the NGS data base Tidal bench mark information water level tidal datums and their relationship to geodetic vertical datums are available at the CO OPS web site http www co ops nos noaa gov www co ops nos noaa

do the horizontal datums differ Which should I use The NAD 27 was based on the Clarke Ellipsoid of 1866 and the NAD 83 is based on the Geodetic Reference System of 1980 The NAD 27 was computed with a single survey point MEADES RANCH in Kansas as the datum point while the NAD 83 was computed as a geocentric reference system with no datum point NAD 83 has been officially adopted as the legal horizontal datum for the United States by the Federal government and has been recognized as such in legislation in 44 of the 50 states The computation of the NAD 83 removed significant local distortions from the network which had accumulated over the years using the original observations and made the NAD 83 much more compatible with modern survey techniques What is HARN or HPGN A High Accuracy Reference Network HARN and a High Precision Geodetic Network HPGN were two designations used for a statewide geodetic network upgrade The generic acronym HARN is now used for both HARN and HPGN and was adopted to remove the confusion arising from the use of two acronyms A HARN is a statewide or regional upgrade in accuracy of NAD 83 coordinates using Global Positioning System GPS observations HARNs were observed to support the use of GPS by Federal state and local surveyors geodesists and many other applications The cooperative network upgrading program began in Tennessee in 1986 The last field observations were completed in Indiana in September 1997 after horizontally upgrading some 16 000 survey stations to A order or B order status Horizontal A order stations have a relative accuracy of 5 mm 1 10 000 000 relative to other A order stations Horizontal B order stations have a relative accuracy of 8 mm 1 1 000 000 relative to other A order and B order stations Of these 16 000 stations NGS has committed to maintaining about 1 400 survey stations named the Federal Base Network and the various states will maintain the remainder What are NGVD 29 and NAVD 88 The National Geodetic Vertical Datum of 1929 The name after May 10 1973 of the Sea Level Datum of 1929 Geodetic Glossary pp 57 Sea Level Datum of 1929 A vertical control datum established for vertical control in the United States by the general adjustment of 1929 Mean sea level was held fixed at the sites of 26 tide gauges 21 in the U S A and 5 in Canada The datum is defined by the observed heights of mean sea level at the 26 tide gauges and by the set of elevations of all bench marks resulting from the adjustment A total of 106 724 km of leveling was involved constituting 246 closed circuits and 25 circuits at sea level The datum was not mean sea level the geoid or any other equipotential surface Therefore it was renamed in 1973 the National Geodetic Vertical Datum on 1929 Geodetic Glossary pp 56 The North American Vertical Datum of 1988 NAVD 88 is the vertical control datum established in 1991 by the minimum constraint adjustment of the Canadian Mexican U S leveling observations It held fixed the height of the primary tidal bench mark referenced to the new International Great Lakes Datum of 1985 local mean sea level height value at Father Point Rimouski Quebec Canada Additional tidal bench mark elevations were not used due to the demonstrated variations in sea surface topography i e the fact that mean sea level is not the same equipotential surface at all tidal bench marks Results of the General Adjustment of the North American Datum of 1988 http www survmap org commun42 salis00 htm Surveying and Land Information Systems Vol 52 No 3 1992 pp 133 149 Why did NGS change from NGVD 29 to NAVD 88 NAVD 88 was computed for many of the same reasons as NAD 83 About 625 000 km of leveling had been added to the NGVD since 1929 Thousands of bench marks had been subsequently destroyed and many others had been affected by crustal motion postglacial rebound and subsidence due to the withdrawal of underground fluids Distortions amounting to as much as 9 meters had been seen due to forcing the new leveling to fit the NGVD 29 height values Results of the General Adjustment of the North American Datum of 1988 http www survmap org commun42 salis00 htm Surveying and Land Information Systems Vol 52 No 3 1992 pp 133 149 All my data are in the NAD 27 or NGVD 29 datum Do I have to purchase new data or is software available to convert old data to new data Horizontal coordinates for most points in NAD 27 exist in NAD 83 and may be obtained relatively inexpensively from NGS via the World Wide Web or NGS Information Services Branch If the coordinate data are not held by NGS two possibilities exist First the original field observations can be used to compute new coordinates via least squares adjustment software using NAD 83 control coordinates If this is not possible NAD 27 coordinates can be converted to NAD 83 coordinates using available software from NGS called NADCON v 2 1 There is usually a loss of accuracy using this process but it often is sufficiently accurate for mapping purposes The accuracy for the conversion is estimated to be 10 15 cm RMS one sigma at the data points used to derive the model with occasional outliers approaching 50 cm Original field observations are unaffected by the change in datums See the directory of PC PROD pc prod shtml PC Software on the NGS Web Site Elevations for many points in the NGVD 29 exist in the NAVD 88 and may be obtained relatively inexpensively from NGS via the World Wide Web or NGS Information Services Branch The conversion procedures noted for NAD 27 coordinates can be used for NGVD 29 elevations Program VERTCON version 2 0 can be used to estimate elevation changes from NGVD 29 to NAVD 88 The accuracy of the conversion is estimated to be 2 cm RMS one sigma at the data points used to define the model As above the original observations are unaffected by the change in datums See the directory of PC PROD pc prod shtml PC Software on the NGS Web Site Can NGS give me the UTM zone or state plane coordinate zone name of a specific site Yes if you have the approximate coordinates of the site you can retrieve the data sheet of a nearby survey station with this information on it The datasheet html DATA SHEET PAGE will enable you to retrieve a data sheet for the area or point you are seeking NGS also offers an interactive service as part of the TOOLS Geodetic Tool Kit to perform this function for individual points What is WGS 84 Does it change WGS 84 is the World Geodetic System of 1984 It is the reference frame used by the U S Department of Defense DoD and is defined by the National Imagery and Mapping Agency http www nima mil NIMA formerly the Defense Mapping Agency WGS 84 is used by DoD for all its mapping charting surveying and navigation needs including its GPS broadcast and precise orbits WGS 84 was defined in January 1987 using Doppler satellite surveying techniques It was used as the reference frame for broadcast GPS Ephemerides orbits beginning January 23 1987 At 0000 GMT January 2 1994 WGS 84 was upgraded in accuracy using GPS measurements The formal name then became WGS 84 G730 since the upgrade date coincided with the start of GPS Week 730 It became the reference frame for broadcast orbits on June 28 1994 At 0000 GMT September 30 1996 the start of GPS Week 873 WGS 84 was redefined again and was more closely aligned with International Earth Rotation Service IERS Terrestrial Reference Frame ITRF 94 It is now formally called WGS 84 G873 WGS 84 G873 was adopted as the reference frame for broadcast orbits on January 29 1997 Where can I find the transformations between versions of WGS 84 and the versions of NAD 83 and the versions of ITRF We know of no compendium which describes the transformations for all possible combinations of versions However a good reference is the paper Maintenance and Enhancement of the World Geodetic System 1984 by Malys and Slater in the proceedings of ION GPS 94 Salt Lake City Sept 20 23 1994 volume

new reference system datum What are NGS s plans Between 1987 and 1997 the National Geodetic Survey in cooperation with other Federal State and local surveying agencies has conducted a resurvey of the United States using Global Positioning System GPS observations often referred to as the High Accuracy Reference Networks HARNs All 50 states American Samoa Guam Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands have now been connected with a network of A order and B order horizontal control points Continued improvements in GPS technology and requirements from users of spatial data will eventually require a transition to an improve global reference frame based on the International Terrestrial Reference Frame ITRF Positions relative to ITRF differ from the existing North American Datum of 1983 NAD 83 by approximately 1 meter in horizontal position and 1 meter in ellipsoidal height NGS already publishes ITRF coordinates for all Continuously Operating Reference Stations CORS and will over the next 3 5 years implement an adjustment to include the HARNs and other GPS data that have been submitted to NGS for adjustment and publication NGS will continue to maintain and improve NAD 83 as the official datum of the United States until such time as it will no longer support requirements for surveying mapping and navigation NGS is currently conducting workshops and seminars around the country to educate data users concerning these and other improvements to the National Spatial Reference System For further information see the initiatives new reference shtml New Reference page at this site

for NGS computed GPS orbits post fit ephemerides A complete list is available including dates and times of implementation upon request Recent reference frames are as follows On January 1 1995 at 0000 GMT the reference frame for NGS orbits changed from ITRF 92 epoch 1994 0 to ITRF 93 epoch 1995 0 On June 30 1996 at 0000 GMT the reference frame for NGS orbits changed from ITRF 93 epoch 1995 0 to ITRF 94 epoch 1996 0 For information contact cgi test redirectNOAA prl u Bill Kass Bill Kass Why does the reference frame change for GPS orbits GPS orbits are computed from data collected by a global network of receivers coordinated by the International GPS Service for Geodynamics IGS The accuracy of the GPS orbits depends on many factors including the accuracy of the coordinates of the data collection sites The earth s surface is not fixed and rigid like an egg shell It consists of many sections or plates which move slowly over time in various directions and rates in a process called crustal motion Scientists have been studying this movement for several reasons This includes wanting to know where land masses are with respect to one another and where they will be in the future Since IGS sites are located on these crustal plates we must be able to estimate where the sites are when the data are collected The International Earth Rotation Service http www iers org IERS periodically computes the positions of the sites for a given date The sites define the IERS International Terrestrial Reference Frame CORS Itrf html ITRF and the date defines the epoch IERS also computes the movements or velocities of the sites to estimate where the sites will be in the near future with some degree of accuracy The ITRF is an internationally accepted standard and is the most accurate geocentric reference system currently available The longer the sites operate the better the positions and velocities can be determined and the more accurate the orbits will be What are the horizontal accuracy requirements for the various orders of stations AA A B first second third These are defined in the Federal Geodetic Control Subcommittee publications Standards and Specifications for Geodetic Control Networks September 1984 and Geometric Geodetic Standards and Specifications for Using GPS Relative Positioning Techniques version 5 May 11 1988 reprinted with corrections August 1 1989 both PC PROD Catalog publications htm available from the National Geodetic Survey I have the latitude and longitude for a particular site Can I convert this into a state plane coordinate or UTM grid coordinate Can NGS do this for me Yes NGS has software available GPPCGP v 2 0 for NAD 27 and SPCS83 v 2 0 for NAD 83 to convert coordinates from latitude and longitude to state plane coordinates and the reverse Program CORPSCON v 4 1 written and maintained by the U S Army Corps of Engineers and available through NGS is a useful program which combines NADCON v 2 1 a program which converts geographic positions from older NGS datums to NAD83 with GPPCGP and SPCS83 There is also software available UTMS v 1 1 to convert NAD 83 latitude and longitude to UTM coordinates These software are available in the directory PC PROD pc prod shtml PC Software of the NGS Web Site NGS will advise users about the conversion process NGS also offers the capability to perform these computations interactively for single points as part of the TOOLS Geodetic Tool Kit What do the different symbols on the USGS topographic maps mean How accurate are these maps What datum are these maps on An explanatory supplement to the http www usgs gov USGS topographic maps explaining the symbols should be available where you purchased the topographic sheets The placement of information on the topographic maps are as accurate as the National Map Accuracy Standards allow and the physical limitations of plotting data on a flat piece of paper allow The Vertical datum upon which the topographic sheets are based is defined in the legend on the maps The statement DATUM IS MEAN SEA LEVEL on topographic sheets prior to 1975 refers to the National Geodetic Vertical Datum of 1929 Is the software I got from NGS Y2K compliant NGS provides geodetic data products and services In the course of developing these products NGS also develops computer programs Software developed by the government is generally considered to be in the public domain and is made available to the general public for the cost of reproduction and distribution usually free if downloaded from an ftp or web site It is distributed with the disclaimer that it is not warranted to be suitable for any particular purpose This means that we cannot formally certify it to be Y2K compliant As a practical matter the government also has an interest in ensuring that the programs it uses will continue to operate None of the programs currently in the NGS catalog and distributed on the NGS ftp and WWW site are known to contain features that will cause them to fail on the Y2K rollover What special hardware is needed to use the various NGS software products Is a hard drive required Do any NGS software products require other software to run or to prepare the data Each software product comes with documentation that explains the platform s on which the software will run Most products will run on an 80x86 based PC Some are written for unix systems Some may require a math coprocessor when run on 80386 systems The documentation for each product will also explain if other software is necessary to support the product or prepare the data In most cases the distribution package contains all the needed components See also the PC PROD downloadFAQ shtml NGS Software Download FAQ What languages are NGS software products written in How do I get the code for a software product NGS uses Fortran C and C The source code is part of the standard distribution package for most products In many cases compiled code for
