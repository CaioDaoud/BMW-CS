updated November 11 2003 Study Reveals Orbital Mixing Between Water and Dissolved Ions The essential role of water as a solvent in chemistry and biology is closely connected to the chemical interactions between dissolved ions and the water molecules immediately surrounding them the first hydration shell However selectively measuring the electronic structure of such water molecules out of all the molecules in the solution has been a formidable challenge With recent developments in soft x ray absorption spectroscopy XAS applied to liquids under ambient conditions such measurements are now possible By combining these measurements taken at ALS Beamline 8 0 1 with density functional theory DFT calculations researchers from Sweden and the U S have demonstrated that the molecular orbitals of the water molecules in the first hydration shell will mix with the d orbitals of a dissolved transition metal ion resulting in characteristic pre edge features in the oxygen 1s XAS spectrum The technique is sensitive enough to easily detect an additional chlorine ion in the hydration shell hydration shells Transition metal ion center surrounded by 18 water molecules 6 in the first hydration shell and 12 in the second In XAS an incident beam of photons can be used to selectively probe the electronic structure of water molecules in the first hydration shell The experimental O 1s XAS spectrum of water with dissolved chromium chloride CrCl3 aq has a pre edge region 532 536 eV containing features not seen in the spectrum of water with dissolved aluminum chloride AlCl3 aq This difference arises because the chromium s empty d states characteristic of transition metals cause it to bond differently with the surrounding water molecules than the non transition metal aluminum A subtraction procedure enhances the differences and reveals three peaks A Water Solution Water is a deceptively simple molecule Three atoms two covalent bonds and a slight dipole moment combine to form a substance with many unusual properties that make it essential to life It is a coolant a heat reservoir an acid a base a nearly universal solvent and a weak electrical conductor it plays a wide range of roles from regulating the Earth s climate to affecting the way proteins fold Many of water s unusual properties arise from its propensity to form hydrogen bonds with nearby molecules Hydrogen bonds are relatively loose based on attractions between opposite electrical charges To better understand what happens when such bonds are formed between water molecules and dissolved ions N slund et al studied the electronic structure of oxygen using an x ray absorption spectroscopy XAS technique that allows measurement of aqueous solutions at atmospheric pressure and room temperature with great sensitivity to the local environment of the dissolved ions With this technique combined with a powerful computational theory the researchers gained insight into the local electronic structure of a hydrogen bonded liquid and were able to identify the fingerprint of the molecules in direct contact with the solvated ion experimental difference spectrum and calculated spectra Features in the difference spectrum between CrCl3 aq and AlCl3 aq red and in the calculated spectra of Cr H2O 6 3 green and CrCl H2O 5 2 blue serve as a spectroscopic proof of d orbital interaction between the Cr3 ion and the water molecules in the first hydration shell DFT calculations for the chromium water cluster Cr H2O 6 3 assign the two features at 533 8 and 535 8 eV to molecular orbitals having strong metal d character In the computed spectrum of a similar complex in which one chloride replaces a water molecule in the first hydration shell CrCl H2O 5 2 the spectrum is shifted upward by about 1 eV generating a feature at 534 5 eV The conditions of the experiment were such that an equal mixture of CrCl H2O 5 2 and Cr H2O 6 3 must be expected and this expectation is beautifully confirmed in the resulting soft x ray spectrum To show that the mixing between the molecular orbitals of water and the Cr3 d orbitals represents a specific example of a more general phenomenon the researchers also studied solutions of another transition metal iron which has a much more complicated solution chemistry The bonding of the Fe3 ion is strong enough to cause deprotonation of the surrounding water molecules resulting in hydroxide ions OH in the first hydration shell Alternatively the addition of hydrochloric acid to the solution lowers the pH inhibits deprotonation and promotes the presence of chlorine ions in the first hydration shell Spectra of a sequence of Fe3 complexes allow a definite assignment of the distinct and complicated d orbital features at 530 0 531 6 and 532 8 eV in the FeCl3 aq spectrum Computed x ray absorption spectra indicate that the first peaks in the FeCl3 aq spectrum at 530 0 and 531 6 eV respectively are due to the interaction between OH molecular orbitals and d orbitals in the metal This is confirmed by the absence of these two peaks in the low pH FeCl3 spectrum where OH is replaced by Cl The broad peak at 532 8 eV is then assigned to the d interaction of the water molecules in the Fe3 ion hydration shell Overall it was possible to assign all the peaks in the spectrum based on computed spectra for various possible compositions of the first hydration sphere extra pre edge features Experimental O 1s x ray absorption spectra of various aqueous solutions Extra pre edge features shaded areas only appear if the dissolved ion is a transition metal Differences between the spectra of the various Fe3 complexes are due to the interaction between OH orbitals and d orbitals in the metal Also shown is the O 1s x ray absorption spectrum of pure water with features attributable to three configurations symmetric and asymmetric of water molecules Although the interaction between the water and the transition metal d orbitals was anticipated in the literature until now there was no direct exerimental evidence for it XAS combined with DFT calculations is the only technique sensitive and selective enough to directly probe local orbital changes resulting from such a weak interaction Soft x ray measurements on ionic solutions have thus been demonstrated to provide unique information on the electronic structure bonding and composition in the first hydration shell of dissolved ions Research conducted by L N slund Stockholm University and Uppsala University M Cavalleri H Ogasawara L G M Pettersson
