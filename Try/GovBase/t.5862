National Laboratory LLNL are working together to bring state of the art science and technology to high school classrooms Together SRVSD and LLNL have transferred crystal growing technology to high school classrooms that grew 500 pound crystals for changing the wavelength of laser light at the stadium sized the National Ignition facility NIF laser facility SRVSD and LLNL will provide training and mentoring to enable high school teachers to be able to use this cutting edge technology Initially the workshops will focus on schools in the vicinity of LLNL In subsequent years the training will be offered to schools throughout the United States http etec ucdavis edu Edward Teller Education Center ETEC ETEC was founded as a K 12 collaboration between UC Davis UC Merced and Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory by the http www ucop edu UC Office of the President UCOP The ETEC collaboration provides professional development for K 12 teachers working in participating districts within the greater Livermore Tri Valley area and the San Joaquin Valley Funding from the UCOP and LLNL was provided to UC Davis to establish ETEC on February 2 2001 The mission of ETEC is to improve the quality of instruction in science and in its applications in technology by providing professional development opportunities for K 12 teachers Specifically these opportunities will be targeted to integrate and support the California subject matter standards and the teachers needs as identified by teachers school districts and county offices of education The science and technology focus uses the close proximity to the world class scientific resources available at LLNL and the existing professional development outreach programs currently available from LLNL s Science Technology Education Program STEP http education llnl gov symposium2004 Edward Teller Science Technology Symposium The Edward Teller Science and Technology Symposium provides a bridge to linking the science classroom with the research laboratory We provide secondary and community college science educators the opportunities to explore ongoing research at the LLNL in physics chemistry biology environmental science and biophotonics Participants will tour state of the art research laboratories talk with researchers about their work and attend hands on workshops to learn new activities they can use in the classroom The lessons and activities are directly linked to the California Science Education Standards Teachers may earn 1 semster unit fro CSU Chico Register online to participate this September fws Fun with Science Scientists from Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory travel to your school site to conduct interactive science presentations and demonstrations in chemistry physical sciences and environmental sciences The presenter engages students in discussions about scientific and technological concepts while asking questions and providing interactive hands on experiments to enhance learning and scientific thinking skills Fun With Science presents to students and teachers at K 8 grade levels The presentations are educational and enjoyable and students learn that Science is Fun
