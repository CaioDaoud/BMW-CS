Fifth District Supervisor for the past six years my colleagues now agree that I m ready to be Chairman of the Board of Supervisors and I m proud to accept Here we are with the State facing upwards of a 35 billion deficit the County s departments are looking for guidance today we are in the middle of the special election to fill the Third District vacancy which we weren t even sure we could hold until this past Saturday the Registrar the Social Services Director the Planning Director and the Public Defender are all retiring And I now sit in the middle seat There is a big deal about being Chairman of the Board It s about being able to provide the leadership necessary to see this County through what will undoubtedly be the biggest budget challenge since the bankruptcy to set an agenda for success at all levels and to exercise the vision necessary to lead with a steady hand I want to introduce a quote from Frank Lloyd Wright which I consider to be appropros I know the price of success dedication hard work and an unremitting devotion to the things you want to see happen I believe much is expected of us all of us more so now than in past years We ve had some real problems over the past few months that have overshadowed the great things this County has done Don t get me wrong the problems should not will not be ignored will not be allowed to fall through the cracks nor will they be pushed aside We must work to keep things in the proper perspective We have a number of key folks retiring so how do we make up for the loss of their expertise How far do we extend the retirement incentive package How do we repair the Planning Department and restore public confidence in it Do we consolidate What are the options All of this comes at a time when our financial future is uncertain To what extent will the State budget affect us this year What will the legislators actually vote for or against I have picked up the gavel and taken on this leadership post at a time when the State of California is hemorrhaging money and the effects to us in Orange County will be nothing short of devastating It seems that with every update we receive from Sacramento the deficit changes by a few billion dollars one way or the other Our latest count ranges from 24 billion to 35 billion Talk about fiscal chaos We don t even know what the real deficit is All we do know is that it is huge To many of us these large sums are difficult to imagine Just how much is that What is a billion dollars Well one way to look at it is this the size of the problem in the California State budget 35 billion is larger than the total budgets of 48 other states The only one with a budget larger than our shortfall is New York Even that analogy is difficult to comprehend So let s break it down even further Basically it amounts to 1 000 for every man woman and child in California Now that makes it understandable but certainly not acceptable What will that mean to us as a County It will most certainly translate into fewer County dollars Unfortunately as is usually the case those who need help the most will suffer the most Health and human services will be cut School districts already being strained by funding cutbacks will suffer even more Programs for our seniors and for those in need will no doubt be eliminated Our cities risk losing their VLF revenues Some are even in danger of losing their cityhood and returning to the County Some city projects will be delayed or deferred Without doubt these are indeed times of great challenge The mantra I ve been hearing for this coming year is Do more with less This County has been doing more with less We are a donor county That means for every 100 we send to Sacramento we get 44 back while other counties get an average of 58 We are in the middle of a hiring freeze with minor exceptions The El Toro battle used up valuable resources tasked our leadership and distracted the Board from the business at hand We ve struggled in the past but we made it work before and we ll make it work again We can t and we won t roll over and let Sacramento decide what is best for us here in Orange County Last week I started work on an initiative to bring all the County municipalities and agencies together with our State legislators to face this budget crisis head on and to look for ways to bridge the inevitable funding and staffing gaps The invitations are in the mail and that meeting will be held in February right here in Orange County Together we have incredible spirit and the opportunity for innovation and creative solutions We have coalesced to overcome daunting challenges in the past and we will do so again For the past couple of weeks the County has been coping with the Planning Department problems It is evident that our safeguards failed and it cost the County a lot of money and much personal distress It s evident that management had a job and they dropped the ball The Board decided last week to make a critical personnel decision in terminating our CEO The Planning problems were just one example of how we need to have more oversight and an increased hands on management style The County will begin a national search for a new CEO who will bring objectivity and a fresh perspective to the position In the meantime we will have an interim CEO Jim Ruth who has excellent credentials coupled with many years of experience in local government The County ladies and gentlemen is under new management and things will be different But everybody has a role This Board cannot do this alone My colleagues and I recognize that these are changing times dynamic times and we all need to be flexible We need to be able to put past differences behind us and adjust to what is to come There are changes in the Board itself Supervisor Chris Norby is now in office and he certainly brings a new perspective to the Fourth District I look forward to working through his goals of fiscal reform of local government and for a more equitable share of property and sales tax revenues to encourage a better job housing balance in our county In the Third District the Board vigorously defended the will of the people to determine their own leadership We decided to move forward with plans to have an election to fill former Supervisor Spitzer s vacancy despite the uncertainty of the court ruling We believed the residents of the Third District deserved the right to choose their Supervisor The election is being held today and we all look forward to the results and to welcoming our new colleague so that we can as a five member board get back to the County s business In the Second District is my colleague Supervisor Jim Silva Representing the two districts with coastline property we ve found a common fight in protecting it Over the past four years Jim and I have partnered on many coastal and watershed mitigation measures He was the champion for full secondary treatment and 100 percent disinfection of sewage outfall Jim has also worked hard in Santa Ana Heights approving plans and designs for various public works projects I certainly have to give Jim a lot of credit for all of the work he has done Holding office at the other end of the fifth floor is my colleague Supervisor Chuck Smith Chuck has been a longtime advocate for affordable housing increasing every year the opportunities for those in need And last year he initiated the first Countywide Elder Abuse Task Force which works to prevent emotional physical and financial abuse of the elderly and dependent adults in Orange County This is a great endeavor and I hope it is seen through Chuck and I have been on opposite ends of major issues in the past but we ve also worked together on a number of things I can tell you any time his name appears in the paper the residents in his district praise him and stand proudly and everyone in my district grimaces and has flashes of airplanes flying over their rooftops I m glad that item is finally behind us and I look forward to working with Chuck on upcoming issues and continuing to make this County better This team this Board needs to rebuild our relationships post El Toro Rather than picking sides we need a five member Board that will aim directly at what unites us rather than what divides us The County will need nothing less if we are to meet the challenges of these uncertain times And I believe we will We also need to recognize that our challenges aren t just coming from Sacramento On September 11 2001 our everyday down home American lifestyles were threatened But this County did not cower We took charge John Wayne Airport immediately developed a plan to make the necessary improvements to accommodate the automated In Line Baggage Screening System At this time it s the largest system of its type at any of the 429 commercial airports in the United States We openly welcomed the Transportation Security Agency to operate the security checkpoints Throughout the airport upgrades and changes were made to make it the safest environment possible for air travelers Sure we ve had some customer frustrations They have at times had to contend with long lines and parking issues as the bugs were worked out but in the end we re better and safer for it Our Health Care Agency has enhanced its bio terrorism response readiness program A biological and chemical terrorism plan was added to the Agency s internal disaster response plan and an Agency Operations Center was developed to manage resources and personnel in the event of an emergency Collaborative planning for bio terrorism response was initiated with cities hospitals and other stakeholders in anticipation of the arrival of federal funding Additionally they established a County Health and Emergency Preparedness Planning Council to assist in moving toward full implementation of the County s bio terrorism response plan in 2003 They are to be commended for these fine efforts and accomplishments The Fire Authority the Health Care Agency and other related public agencies have taken their charge seriously We can be comforted by the quality and level of commitment to public safety and Homeland Security demonstrated by each and every member of these outstanding organizations Even closer to home we have faced and overcome tragedies which came right into our community Samantha Runyon a little girl from Orange County was kidnapped and brutally murdered Without hesitation our Sheriff Michael Carona and the fine men and women in his department set out with determination and focus to find her killer and bring him to justice With help from the public the alleged perpetrator was found arrested and is now facing charges of murder kidnapping and child molestation This wasn t the only child abduction case or criminal act last year and each time our Sheriff and his team of professionals stepped up and responded with the same will power and resolve This driven attitude extends way beyond the Sheriff s Department The County is in good hands And even as I speak we are working to establish a state of the art integrated Law and Justice System which will link all the information compiled by the Sheriff s Department city police departments and other justice agencies into one database We are truly using technology to our best public safety advantage It is quite obvious that public safety is not getting short shrift here in the County of Orange Along with a constant sense of personal security and protection everyone in Orange County deserves an efficient smooth functioning government It is our responsibility to provide just that It simply boils down to good government The fundamental structure of the County continues to be a work in progress and the circumstances we confront demand the strongest leadership and vision throughout the County organization especially at the top Good government is an attainable goal for us It means becoming more effective accepting accountability introducing efficiencies becoming increasingly responsive and certainly accessible These aren t new ways of thinking for many of us Most of our departments have a history of using their talents and expertise to find new ways to better serve the County Last year the Child Support Services was developed as a new department to enhance the quality of life for our most precious assets our kids This new department is creating methods to establish and enforce court orders for the financial and medical support for our children Our public libraries added three branches last year bringing the total to 30 And because of that the public now has access to more than 500 computers throughout Orange County Internet usage has increased substantially as has book circulation Our Office on Aging worked with HCA and OCTA to develop and implement the Senior Non Emergency Medical Transportation Program SMART That acronym is very appropriate This volunteer system enables seniors to access needed medical services This team also collaborated with other County organizations to form the Interagency Committee on Aging ICA with a charge to establish a comprehensive and coordinated long term care system Then there are those who take care of our waste Our Integrated Waste Management Department has been a very good neighbor and is working on developing environmentally friendly disposal methods Our Social Services Agency has worked with other organizations to expand services such as domestic violence prevention health access and child abuse prevention that are available through the Family Resource Centers They continue to provide support to community service participants families with employment barriers and to victims of domestic abuse Our Public Facilities and Resources Department finally broke ground on Laguna Canyon Road one of my long term pet projects We ve begun implementing very strict water quality regulations resulting from our most recent permits from the Regional Boards These efforts serve to strengthen our already unwavering County commitment to cleaning up our beaches and creeks And PFRD is now ready to launch the design phase for the Dana Point Harbor Revitalization project They can indeed be proud of their successes Our Housing and Community Development Department has certainly been busy this past year The Board of Supervisors approved their plan for 697 units of affordable housing in 2002 By the end of 2002 HCD was assisting 9 703 households to achieve affordable housing through the Orange County Housing Authority This Authority was able to increase assistance to seniors by 36 percent and to disabled persons by 22 percent One of the biggest moments for HCD came last December when they were awarded more than 9 7 million in homeless assistance grants This was the largest grant ever given to Orange County I certainly applaud Paula Burrier Lund and her very able staff on a remarkable year Some of our Departments have been taking advantage of opportunities provided by the Internet Our Clerk of the Board has developed a new web site allowing the general public easy 24 7 access to information forms and educational power point presentations and services including online filing for property tax appeals Some folks may even be listening to this meeting on the Internet Our Registrar of Voters has made it easy for voters to submit their voter registration application via the Internet and also developed multilingual web sites providing information in Spanish and Vietnamese with Chinese and Korean to follow this year All of the departments have on staff a number of talented individuals some shine and rise to the top and are recognized Some have quiet talents and consistently produce great work And others are overshadowed by bad departmental decisions that are out of their control I would like to thank all of the County staff who have excelled in the past year I know we re up to the year ahead of us and I thank you in advance for your continued commitment and unwavering determination Keep up the good work As you can see this County has been busy In many cases we ve put our best minds forward to develop and implement state of the art methods to serve our constituents Televised Board meetings community based land use planning reactivating our coordinating committees with other public agencies annexations to eliminate unincorporated islands all very positive steps toward good government Of course there is more to be done The Planning Department actions over the last several months have hurt the County We have a team of auditors and managers developing a strategy to recover from this As we begin to look back we can see where the system failed These problems were avoidable However decisions were made to either ignore or disguise the issues In the end we are all suffering but we shall recover No one should be surprised that any form of bureaucracy innately has serious fundamental problems with leadership and accountability Orange County s organizational changes which resulted from the bankruptcy were certainly a good start in confronting such problems But there is much more work to do We ve already acknowledged that a new management style is needed and made the necessary changes I believe this Board is up to the task of seeing this through It s time to get back to business We must ensure that all our departments and their personnel have the tools they need to be successful to provide the services each of us depends on Our staff is talented and hard working and they deserve the Board s unswerving commitment and vision in an effort to empower them for optimal success with minimum investment In December we implemented the retirement incentive packages and now know the results The impacts are significant As I noted earlier we re losing some valuable people Our Registrar our Public Defender our Social Services Director and many other key senior staff members who have worked for this County for a very long time are retiring And we thank them for their service But with change there come new opportunities Those who will be filling these empty shoes and the remaining staff for sure have their work cut out for them We will be doing more with less in some cases much less The only answer to that is that we will have to do some bureaucracy busting We will have to depend on our staff to tell us how to get the job done and how to get it done better To help us do that we need better communications This is going to be more important than ever among the Supervisors between and among our departments and with our legislators both State and Federal our cities our businesses and of course our residents We can t afford duplication of effort disconnects or posturing What we CAN afford is to establish partnerships and form collaborations which will allow us all to do our jobs better more effectively and more efficiently In the end we all serve the same masters the taxpayers and those folks should expect nothing less The County will continue to work on regional ways to improve and protect our most valuable asset our quality of life Our environment our jobs our recreation opportunities where we live work and play all woven into the way we live make up Orange County s quality of life Quality of life means something different to everyone but it is all based upon the decisions and the actions taken by this County as a whole Part of the leadership we need to strive for will not only maintain our quality of life but will also make it better I believe our County represents a tradition that has transcended bankruptcy recessions wars and changing economies And I believe it will undoubtedly transcend this latest fiscal debacle Our County represents the fundamental requirements of good government and I m proud of the dedicated men and women who have worked hard to ensure safe streets healthy children good public services accessible legal systems and timely emergency response It is my goal as Chairman of the Orange County Board of Supervisors to re establish a government that is accountable responsive compassionate thoughtful and yet unafraid to make the tough calls in a timely fashion It s true we do face uncertain times We will face them together as a team As Ed Harris said in the movie Apollo 13 Failure is not an option I m certain that we have our priorities straight and we will emerge stronger and better for it I said it before I ll say it again The Board that I now chair is up to the task It will take strength and trust and I emphasize trust That strength and trust is necessary at all levels and support from all of the folks in our districts I know we have that In closing I am going to ask this Board the County family and the citizens of the many communities we all serve to NOT approach the coming months or even the next couple of years with our heads bent low or with heavy hearts Rather I ask that we all enter this formidable fiscal storm with heads held high with a fresh spirit and with an attitude that says whatever it is that may darken our door we can beat it It is said that of those to whom much is given much is expected We on the Orange County Board of Supervisors accept this challenge and we will not let you down Ladies and Gentlemen it IS back to business for the County of Orange Thank you very much mailto webmaster ocgov com Contact Us Contact Us Contact Us OC Home
