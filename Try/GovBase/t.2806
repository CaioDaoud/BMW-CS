Divisions Div841 Gp1 BL 9 html The XUV Detector Calibration Beamline at SURF III One of the beamlines BL 9 at SURF III is dedicated to the calibration of transfer standard detectors in the XUV spectral region from 5 nm to 50 nm power html Nuclear Power Industry NEI NIST Measurement Assurance Program Nuclear Energy Institute NEI established a Measurement Assurance Program at NIST to provide sponsoring nuclear utilities commercial suppliers of radioactive sources and service laboratories independent verifications traceable to NIST pharm html Radiopharmaceutical Industry NEI NIST Measurement Assurance Program Nuclear Energy Institute NEI and the National Institute of Standards and Technology have cooperated in a measurements assurance program in the field of nuclear medicine Participation in the program allows sponsors an independent verification traceability to NIST of their capability to make accurate radioactivity measurements Divisions Div846 Gp2 mammo html Mammographic X Ray Instrument Calibration Range The Ionizing Radiation Division in the Physics Laboratory has established new national standards for radiation exposure from x ray beams used in mammography and has completed new facilities for calibration of exposure meters in these beams http www boulder nist gov timefreq service fms htm Frequency Measurement and Analysis Service The NIST Frequency Measurement and Analysis Service makes it easy to measure and calibrate any quartz rubidium or cesium frequency standard All measurements are made automatically and are traceable to NIST at an uncertainty level of 5 10 13 per day Subscribers to the NIST service receive a complete frequency measurement system which includes everything needed to make state of the art frequency measurements that are traceable to NIST http www boulder nist gov timefreq service gpstrace htm NIST Global Positioning System GPS Data Archive NIST continuously monitors the Global Positioning System GPS satellite signals from Boulder Colorado and compares the frequency standard on each satellite to the NIST frequency standard The results are published in the NIST GPS Data Archive The archived data can be used to support claims of frequency traceability to NIST through the use of GPS since the frequency uncertainty of each satellite is listed You can use the archive to quickly check the status of the GPS constellation on any given date New GPS data from the previous day are added to the archive daily at about 1600 UTC NIST Time Services http nist time gov NIST Web Clock See a display of what time it is anywhere in the country The reference for the clock is the NIST Time Scale in Boulder CO http www boulder nist gov timefreq service acts htm Automated Computer Time Service ACTS NIST s Automated Computer Time Service ACTS has been provided since 1988 to those users who need to synchronize computer clocks to the correct time Using ACTS requires only a computer a modem and some simple software When a computer connects to ACTS by telephone it receives an ASCII time code The information in the time code is then used to set the computer s clock http www boulder nist gov timefreq service its htm NIST Internet Time Service The NIST Internet Time Service allows users to synchronize computer clocks via the Internet The time information provided by the service is directly traceable to UTC NIST The service responds to time requests from any Internet client in several formats including the DAYTIME TIME and NTP protocols Optical Technology Calibration Services Divisions
