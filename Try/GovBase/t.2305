Social Security Retirement Benefits Online About Us Welcome to the FirstGov for Seniors website The senior citizen population is the fastest growing demographic group in the United States Members of the baby boom generation the generation born after World War II will begin to retire in large numbers around 2010 Baby boomers are already contacting federal agencies to apply for disability and veterans benefits The unprecedented demand for services by this group is one of government s most pressing concerns in the new millennium An Internet website geared specifically toward seniors provides an outstanding opportunity to help meet those demands Accessed via a World Wide Web browser the Internet has become an important communication vehicle for obtaining information about government services Most Federal agencies now have websites Because the web is not always customer friendly individuals seeking information about a particular agency s services may need to make an extensive search i e surf the net to find the information they seek Members of the public should be able to go to one comprehensive website to help them find the particular agency ies to satisfy their needs FirstGov for Seniors was designed with those needs in mind FirstGov for Seniors will empower citizens to obtain valuable health and security information and services at one location via the Internet FirstGov for Seniors is one of several projects created at the direction of the National Partnership for Reinventing Government NPRG The Social Security Administration SSA agreed to create host and maintain FirstGov for Seniors as a service especially geared toward senior citizens Many of the services provided by FirstGov for Seniors can be replicated in the private sector However there are compelling reasons for the government to provide portal services within the federal sphere Government is a trusted source of information Government is less likely to restrict information or promote information that is biased by a commercial interest Government will not track usage and Government would be more likely to support information presentation on lesser used programs and not select strictly on the basis of user demand Vision In 1997 the National Partnership for Reinventing Government NPR outlined a plan to provide Americans with better access to government services and benefits The FirstGov plan calls for cross agency participation to improve government services to citizens business and other federal and state government agencies by reengineering federal information systems and implementing electronic service delivery mechanisms in particular Internet based electronic access and service delivery While advances have been made many government services are still paper based and require that people apply in person as well as wait many days for the information or services they seek When all the proposed improvements are in place the public will have access to government services and information 24 hours per day 7 days per week For example instead of driving to the Post Office to complete a change of address form people will be able to complete the form on line and submit it electronically any time of the day or night from home computers as well as those in schools libraries and other public venues This change of address data can then be propagated to every federal agency where the customer does business if supportEmptyParas Information that once took weeks to be received will be immediately available Rather than being required to file applications in person during working hours people will be able to file them electronically 24 hours a day The FirstGov concept is to focus on specific segments of the population such as senior citizens or students and direct resources and efforts toward improving service delivery to the targeted population Goals Secure Easy Access to Government Services and Benefits for Seniors Initially the FirstGov for Seniors site will help users access all government sites that provide services for senior citizens such as SSA Health Care Financing Administration the Administration on Aging the Department of Veterans Affairs etc There are also links to all federal agencies and all 50 States if supportEmptyParas endif The FirstGov for Seniors Internet services will give older Americans the option of conducting their government business electronically along with the ability to transact business with a wide range of government agencies and programs Using a one stop shopping approach seniors will have access to agencies at the Federal State and local levels They will also be able to search for programs that meet their needs without having to know which agency at which level can deliver the services they seek Cross Government Participation Cross agency participation and cooperation are key elements in making the Seniors site a success since the primary goal is to create a virtual agency that can be used to locate services across a wide range of agencies within the federal bureaucracy Cross agency partnerships are important for many reasons They provide focus on topics e g senior services retirement planning health services travel etc rather than program specific services e g a Social Security benefit In addition certain types of services can be offered that no one agency may have the resources to implement For example the authentication infrastructure that we discuss below may be too expensive for any one agency to create However this goal and others can be realized if all agencies work together top Top of Page Divider Bar about html About Us ask html Feedback privacy html Privacy search Search This Site sitemap html Site Map index htm Home Disclaimer References
