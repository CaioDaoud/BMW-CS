THE CLINTON GORE ADMINISTRATION HIGHLIGHTS THE IMPORTANCE OF THEIR PLAN TO STRENGTHEN AND MODERNIZE MEDICARE FOR WOMEN THE CLINTON GORE ADMINISTRATION HIGHLIGHTS THE IMPORTANCE OF THEIR PLAN TO STRENGTHEN AND MODERNIZE MEDICARE FOR WOMEN July 27 1999 Today at the White House President Clinton and First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton will join the Older Women s League OWL in releasing a report entitled Medicare Why Women Care which includes a new analysis documenting why strengthening and modernizing Medicare is particularly important to women of all ages The President and the First Lady will also underscore the importance of taking advantage of the historic opportunity to dedicate a significant portion of the surplus to secure the life of the Medicare trust fund for a quarter century In releasing this report OWL states its strong support for the President s vision of dedicating the surplus to strengthen Medicare adding a prescription drug benefit and improving preventive services The Vice President will later join the Democratic leadership on Capitol Hill and release a new analysis on the greater challenges that beneficiaries in rural America face in accessing prescription drug coverage He will point out that although representing less than one fourth of the Medicare population beneficiaries living in rural areas account for greater than one in three of all beneficiaries lacking prescription drug coverage Today the Clinton Gore Administration UNVEILS A NEW REPORT BY THE OLDER WOMEN S LEAGUE Nearly 60 percent of Medicare beneficiaries are women and this proportion rises with age more than 4 in 5 people over age 100 are women Moreover older women tend to have more chronic illness and lower incomes making Medicare even more important as a health and financial safety net Since it was created in 1965 Medicare has contributed to lengthening older women s lives by 20 percent and reducing their poverty rate dramatically Yet the 21st century brings with it challenges that will affect all beneficiaries Key findings of the report include In the next 30 years the number of Medicare beneficiaries will double most of them will be women In 2035 alone there will be nearly 40 million elderly women and fewer than 34 million older men This large enrollment increase is a major factor in the projected exhaustion date of 2015 for the Medicare trust fund and in the need for more revenue to avoid devastating cuts to the program Total prescription drug spending for women on Medicare averages 1 200 nearly 20 percent more than for men Moreover like all beneficiaries about three fourths of women have coverage that is inadequate unstable and declining Of those women without drug coverage fully 50 percent have income above 150 percent of poverty about 12 750 for a single person 17 000 for a couple despite older women s lower average income Medicare s preventive benefits are underused by older women Financial and information barriers prevent older women from using critical preventive services For example in recent years just 1 in 7 women have taken advantage of Medicare covered mammograms Other key findings include MEDICARE A SOURCE OF FINANCIAL AND HEALTH CARE SECURITY FOR OLDER WOMEN IS AT RISK Most elderly Americans covered by Medicare are women Of the 34 million elderly Americans covered by Medicare 20 million are women who comprise nearly 3 out of 5 older Americans The proportion of the elderly who are women rises with age about 71 percent of people age 85 or older are women Eighty three percent of centenarians are women in fact the number of women age 100 or older will double in the next 10 years New revenue is necessary to ensure that the Medicare trust fund is solvent when women in the baby boom generation retire Since most women turning 65 today are expected to live through 2018 the projected insolvency of the Medicare Trust Fund will occur within their lifetimes Women have greater health care needs and lower income Older women are more likely to need Medicare s health care services About 73 percent have two or more chronic illnesses compared to 65 percent of men Women s incomes are lower than men s incomes and they must stretch fewer financial resources over longer lives Seven out of 10 Medicare beneficiaries living below poverty are women The increased likelihood that women will live alone in their later years places them at increased risk of poverty WOMEN FACE GREATER COST BURDENS AND BARRIERS TO HEALTH CARE BECAUSE OF MEDICARE BENEFIT LIMITATIONS As important as Medicare coverage is to women its benefits are outdated Higher out of pocket health spending The combination of greater health problems and lower income causes women on Medicare to spend 22 percent of their income on health care compared to 17 percent for men Lower income women spend an even greater share of their limited incomes on health care 53 percent for the poorest Total prescription drug spending averages 1 200 for women on Medicare nearly 20 percent more than that of men Older women tend to have more chronic illnesses that require medication to manage For most women existing coverage is unstable unaffordable and declining Medigap routinely increases premiums with age at age 85 the premium for a Medigap plan with drug coverage up to 1 250 costs from 300 to 400 per month 3 600 to 4 800 per year This discriminates against women who comprise nearly three fourths of people in this age group It also charges more at a time where income has declined About 7 3 million women on Medicare have no coverage to help pay for their prescription drug costs Despite their lower average income fully half of these women without drug coverage have income above 150 percent of poverty underscoring the importance of drug coverage for people of all age groups Out of pocket payments for preventive services also constitute a barrier to health In recent years just one in seven women without supplemental insurance used Medicare covered mammograms One study found that in 1993 only 37 percent of Medicare beneficiaries without supplemental insurance had Pap smears compared with 59 percent of women who had supplemental insurance EMPHASIZES GREATER PROBLEMS FACING RURAL BENEFICIARIES IN ACCESSING PRESCRIPTION DRUG COVERAGE The Vice President also will release new facts on the challenges facing rural beneficiaries Although one in four of all Medicare beneficiaries live in rural areas more than one in three 34 percent of those lacking drug coverage live in rural America In fact nearly half of all rural beneficiaries lack drug coverage compared to 34 percent of all beneficiaries This reflects the reduced access to Medicare managed care and retiree health coverage for these beneficiaries The Vice President also will release information documenting that lack of access to prescription drug coverage occurs throughout the income spectrum 45 percent of rural beneficiaries with income above 50 000 lack prescription drug coverage compared to 25 percent of all beneficiaries HIGHLIGHTS THE IMPORTANCE OF INVESTING IN THE FUTURE OF THE MEDICARE PROGRAM Today the President Vice President and First Lady will underscore the fact that there will not be a debate about how to strengthen Medicare or how to provide a prescription drug benefit if all of the surplus is invested in a large tax cut They stated their strong belief that the Congress and the American public face an important decision to invest in a stronger Medicare program for our mothers and grandmothers or give away the entire surplus on a risky and irresponsible tax scheme Click on any chart below to view it full size chart1 html Bar Graph Most Medicare Beneficiaries Are Women chart2 html Bar Graph
