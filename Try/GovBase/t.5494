MRLs spacer spacer Toxicological Profile Information Sheet Background By Congressional mandate the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry ATSDR produces toxicological profiles for hazardous substances found at National Priorities List NPL sites These hazardous substances are ranked based on frequency of occurrence at NPL sites toxicity and potential for human exposure Toxicological profiles are developed from a priority list of 275 substances ATSDR also prepares toxicological profiles for the Department of Defense DOD and the Department of Energy DOE on substances related to federal sites So far 269 toxicological profiles have been published or are under development as finals or drafts for public comment 244 profiles were published as finals 106 profiles have been updated Currently 16 profiles are being revised based on public comments received and 1profile is being developed as public comment draft These profiles cover more than 250 substances Toxicological profiles are developed in two stages 1 DRAFTS The toxicological profiles are first produced as drafts ATSDR announces in the Federal Register the release of these draft profiles for a 90 day public comment period Request draft toxicological profiles from ATSDR s Division of Toxicology 2 FINALS After the 90 day comment period ATSDR considers incorporating all comments into the documents ATSDR finalizes the profiles and the National Technical Information Service NTIS distributes them ATSDR s toxicological mailing list Congress requires ATSDR 1 to provide toxicological profiles to state health and environmental agencies and 2 to make them available to other interested parties The Division of Toxicology DT has a mailing list which is updated and verified yearly of groups and individuals who get
