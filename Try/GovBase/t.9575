These criminal prosecutions are the first cases to be brought as a result of the fifteen month software piracy investigation known as Operation Safehaven According to documents filed in federal court MYERS KATZ and KAPECHUK were all participants in the warez scene an underground online community that consists of individuals and organized groups who use the Internet to engage in the large scale illegal distribution of copyrighted software In the warez scene certain participants known as suppliers are able to obtain access to copyrighted software video games DVD movies and MP3 music files often before those titles are even available to the general public Other participants known as crackers then use their technical skills to circumvent or crack the digital copyright protections and yet others known as couriers distribute the pirated software to various file servers on the Internet for others to access reproduce and further distribute Stealing the intellectual property of others is no different from any other form of thievery said U S Attorney Kevin J O Connor It is a priority of this Office and the Department of Justice to protect the intellectual property rights of our nation s inventors and creators John Malcolm Deputy Assistant Attorney General for the Criminal Division of the U S Department of Justice added that over the past two years the Department of Justice has conducted the most aggressive and successful prosecutions of online piracy to date Operation Safehaven is just another step in our continuing effort to target organized online piracy at all levels In

for operating and maintaining several computers used in the warez scene including a file server that was used to illegally collect store and distribute tens of thousands of pirated software titles

prosecuted as a result of Operation Safehaven a fifteen month investigation conducted by U S Immigration and Customs Enforcement ICE and the ICE Cyber Crimes Center in conjunction with the U S Attorney s Office for the District of Connecticut and the Department of Justice Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section CCIPS Building off the success of a previous Customs investigation called Operation Buccaneer Operation Safehaven targeted a broader swath of warez participants The investigation culminated in April 2003 with the simultaneous execution of over twenty 20 search warrants nationwide resulting in the seizure of thousands of pirated CDs and DVDs plus dozens of computers and servers including the largest warez site ever seized in the United States to date Software piracy is a growing multi billion dollar crime that hurts both businesses and consumers said Michael J Garcia Acting Assistant Secretary for U S Immigration and Customs Enforcement ICE will continue to use its vital resources such as the National Intellectual Property Rights Coordination Center and the ICE Cyber Crimes Center to dismantle organizations using the Internet to facilitate
