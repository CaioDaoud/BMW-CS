transfers from the federal government through BLM to the State of Alaska and Alaska Native corporations could be completed as soon as 2009 under an ambitious program envisioned by BLM and made possible by proposed new Congressional legislation The Alaska Land Transfer Acceleration Act of 2003 could become the most significant piece of legislation affecting land in Alaska in more than 20 years says BLM Alaska State Director Henri Bisson The proposed legislation seeks to resolve road blocks by allowing major changes in BLM s land transfer process If passed by Congress it would finalize a list of pending Native allotment applications simplify title recovery acreage calculations and survey requirements streamline procedures for making land available to underselected villages streamline conversion of mining claims affected by land transfers establish a local appeals board to resolve land transfer disputes and conflicts authorize BLM to classify public land for various uses
