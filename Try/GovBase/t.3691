died or are still missing 870 000 people 18 of the total population were affected by the storm The Nicaraguan government estimated that nationwide more than 30 000 houses had been either totally or partially destroyed and as many as 870 000 people were estimated to have been displaced Transportation officials reported on November 6th that 70 of the roads were unusable and at least 71 bridges had been destroyed or heavily damaged http hurricane info usaid gov reports nicaragua html USAID report on Nicaragua http www clearinghouse gob ni Nicaragua Clearinghouse node Communications Telephones 66

impressive economic reforms and had begun to shed the legacy of a decade of civil war and economic mismanagement by posting strong annual growth numbers The storm has put the reform effort on hold and has changed economic forecasts for the foreseeable future Nicaragua the poorest country in Central America was one of the hardest hit by the hurricane Nicaragua sustained approximately 1 billion in damages and will probably see GDP growth slow by at least one percentage point in 1999 Hardest hit was the all important agriculture sector which is responsible for the majority of exports As a result the trade deficit is likely to balloon in 1999 to roughly 900 million Significant aid and relief have helped to stabilize the country In addition the Paris Club and other creditors have offered substantial debt relief Nevertheless additional financing will be needed to restore the economy to its pre Mitch condition Population below poverty line 50 3 1993 est Inflation rate consumer prices 16

Nicaragua Project Chief Eugene S Schweig Project Summary Statement of the Problem During Hurricane Mitch parts of Nicaragua was inundated with up to 110 cm in a few days The disaster that made the news was the large debris flow at Volc n Casita where 2 000 lives were lost However many smaller debris flows and other types of landslides occurred throughout northern Nicaragua and many of these have been reactivated during the 1999 2000 rainy season posing threats to homes highways and hospitals Furthermore had Hurricane Mitch tracked just a few kilometers to the south other major landslides affecting large populations could have occurred Thus we are planning to study the causes and consequences of the landslides that did occur the likelihood of future landslides both in selected areas affected by Hurricane Mitch and in a selected populated area to the south and what mitigation efforts might be possible in these areas Strategy to Address the Problem Nicaragua is the largest country in Central America and access to much of the area affected by Mitch is difficult Given the limited time and budget for this project we worked with the Instituto Nicarag ense de Estudios Teritoriales INETER to select four study areas that are characteristic of the landslide problems that occurred during Mitch in northern Nicaragua These areas were chosen through a combination of population affected severity of the ground failure and access while trying to address a wide range of landslide types and geological settings Furthermore we will prepare landslide inventory and susceptibility maps of a rectangle enclosing the Matagalpa and Jinotega metropolitan areas and the Lago de Apan s reservoir In the first four study areas we will develop a comprehensive inventory of slope failures paying particular attention to mechanisms of failure and the local geology We will use the results of these studies to make generalizations that can be used in similar settings elsewhere in Nicaragua The first step will be to acquire large scale aerial photography which will be accomplished largely through a contract that INETER has with a Spanish company We will next map the slope failures that occurred in the target areas noting local geological conditions and evidence of pre Mitch ground failures Upon completion of the photographic mapping we will conduct field reconnaissance studies of selected features in each target area to verify the accuracy of the mapping and to make direct field observations of the features and underlying geology and the human impact of the past present and future landslides During this field review stage project staff will also have the opportunity to interact with and train in country colleagues as well as inform local officials about the potential effects of unstable slopes in their jurisdiction Following the photographic mapping and field checking landslide information on the working maps will be digitized and added to a GIS compatible database Ultimately the digital information will be used to produce a suite of Landslide Inventory Maps for the target areas The maps will be accompanied by a comprehensive report describing the general extent and nature of the slope failures a summary and discussion of the field observations and in some cases recommendations on mitigation measures The GIS database will be added to other digital databases that are being assembled for the Central America information clearinghouse We will provide equipment and train in country colleagues to prepare similar products for other parts of Nicaragua The larger Matagalpa area map will be more regional in nature and focus on landslide susceptibility near the high population density narrow valleys Objectives The two primary objectives of this project are to develop a inventory of landslides in the four small study areas and a landslide susceptibility map in the Matagalpa area that can be used to identify areas still threatened by landslides and to assess the potential impact of failure of slopes that remain unstable These will be used for basic training of in country counterparts to be able to prepare similar maps in other areas Approach Scope In conjunction with INETER colleagues and the US AID mission we have identified for target areas where significant slope failures are reported all in northwestern Nicaragua Dipitlo Cinco Pinos east of El Sauce and San Isidro We also will be working in the area in and north of Matagalpa to prepare a landslide susceptibility map Principle Central American counterpart
