establishing the Council the State Legislature centralized the evaluation and oversight of large energy facilities in a single location within state government The Legislature called for balancing demand for new energy facilities with the broad interests of the public As part of the balancing process protection of environmental quality safety of energy facilities and concern for energy availability are all to be taken into account by the Council The Council s responsibilities derive from the Revised Code of Washington RCW lawrule html 80 50 and include siting large natural gas and oil pipelines thermal electric power plants that are 350 megawatts or greater and their dedicated transmission lines new oil refineries or large expansions of existing facilities and underground natural gas storage fields In addition energy facilities of any size that exclusively use alternative energy resources wind solar geothermal landfill gas wave or tidal action or biomass energy can opt in to the EFSEC review and certification process EFSEC s authority does not extend to hydro based power plants thermal electric plants that are less than 350 megawatts or to general transmission lines EFSEC has been delegated authority by the U S Environmental Protection Agency to issue permits under the Federal Water Pollution Control Act and the Federal Clean Air Act for facilities under its
