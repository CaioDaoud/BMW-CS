NASA Neurolab Web To Live and Work aboard the Space Shuttle The Neurolab science program includes experiments in a number of disciplines Starfield background Getting into Space 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 lift off Four days before lift off of the Space Shuttle from Kennedy Space Center s Launch Pad 39A or 39B the launch count down starts During the four days all onboard systems undergo a final check Astronauts called Astronaut Support Persons ASPs or Cape Crusaders support much of the pre launch activities at KSC They work inside the Space Shuttle s crew compartment at assisting Launch Control in verifying the proper function of all systems They also make sure that all switches in the Shuttle s flight deck and middeck are positioned in launch configuration prior to the crew s arrival About 5 hours before launch the flight crew is awakened Everybody takes a shower has breakfast and gets suited since the Challenger accident they wear the orange Launch and Entry Suit LES which is a full pressure suit that contains an independent pressure and oxygen system and survival gear to increase survival chances in the event of a launch failure The LES enables the astronauts to bail out of the orbiter in high altitudes Once the astronauts are dressed they board the Astro Van and drive to the Launch Pad The crew arrives at the Launch Pad about 2 5 hours before launch They board an elevator that takes them to the 195 foot level platform An access arm with the white room located at its end connects the 195 foot platform with the Space Shuttle hatch The white room is a small cabin where final checks on the LES suit are performed and where the astronauts put on their parachute harness and communication equipment From the white room they access the Space Shuttle through the hatch and crawl onto their seats which is somewhat tricky because the Shuttle is in a vertical position for launch the wall of the crew compartment is now the floor Suit technicians and the ASPs helps them to get comfortable in their seats and straps them in About 1 hour before scheduled lift off the ASPs seal the Shuttle s hatch and perform a final check for leaks They then leave the Launch Pad and drive three miles down the road For safety reasons no human being is allowed within a 3 mile radius of the Launch Pad during lift off During all these activities the count down continues The last planned count down hold is scheduled at T 9 minutes The count down is held for 10 minutes to allow last checks if necessary The Launch Director conducts a final polling of the personnel at the Launch Control Center if everything is go for launch the count down continues At 7 minutes and 30 seconds the Shuttle s access arm retracts At 1 minute and 57 seconds the LH2 terminate replenish and at 31 seconds before lift off the Redundant Set Launch Sequencer RSLS on board the Shuttle takes over control of the launch sequence At T 6 6 seconds the ignition sequence for the three main engines begins The three Space Shuttle Main Engines SSMEs are positioned in the aft portion of the orbiter s fuselage Every 120 milliseconds another engine ignites in the order 3 2 1 If one or more of the three SSME s do not reach 90 of their rated thrust by T 3 seconds all SSME s are shut down automatically and the launch sequence is interrupted At T O seconds the Solid Rocket Boosters SRBs are ignited The lift off of the Space Shuttle occurs almost immediately because of the extremely rapid thrust build up of the SRB s A new clock the mission event time MET starts running Eight seconds into the flight the Space Shuttle rolls 120 degrees to the right and continues to climb in a heads down position in an arc over the Atlantic ocean Fifty seconds after lift off the Shuttle reaches the point of highest atmospheric pressure at the speed of Mach 1 one time the speed of sound The main engines are throttled down to about 67 of their maximal thrust to reduce the stress on the Shuttle s structure during the phase of maximum aerodynamic pressure Often a white cloud builds around the Shuttle when flying through this phase due to water vapor condensing into clouds caused by the high pressure The main engines are throttled up again at MET 65 seconds Two minutes into the flight the Solid Rocket Boosters have used up their propellant At that time the Shuttle has reached a speed of 4 5 mach and an altitude of 45 kilometers 28 miles The SRB s separate from the External Tank and fall back towards the Atlantic Ocean Parachutes open at a lower altitude to land the SRB s safely in the water Two recovery ships pick them up and bring them back to Kennedy Space Center The SRB s are refurbished and refilled for another launch While the Solid Rocket Boosters were burning the ride into space was shaky and rough Now with only the three main engines burning it becomes a fairly smooth ride for the astronauts Six and a half minutes into the flight the Space Shuttle reaches the point of greatest acceleration at 3 G with a speed of 15 mach and an altitude of 130 kilometers 80 miles From this point until main engine cut off MECO at 8 5 minutes the Shuttle does not climb any more and the acceleration is used to reach a higher orbital speed The main engines are throttled down once again to limit the loading of the Space Shuttle structures to 3 G Eighteen seconds after MECO the External Tank separates from the Space Shuttle and falls back to earth where it burns up in the atmosphere and small fractions of it will splash into remote areas of the Indian or Pacific Oceans At that time the Space Shuttle is in an elliptical orbit with its lowest position at about 120 kilometers altitude and its highest point at 400 kilometers Half an orbit later 45 minutes into the flight the Shuttle reaches the highest point of the elliptical orbit The two Orbital Maneuvering System OMS engines positioned above the main engines in the aft portion of the Shuttle fire for several seconds to place the Space Shuttle in a high altitude circular orbit generally between 260 to 400 kilometers 160 to 250 miles One of the first activities the astronauts have to perform after reaching space is to open the payload bay doors The inner surface of the doors contain radiators that shed excess heat generated by the orbiter If the doors could not be opened the mission would have to be aborted within 8 hours Other activities in the first few hours after insertion into orbit include the activation of all life support systems the kitchen the toilet and to stow all hardware that is only needed for launch and reentry such as the Escape Pole and the seats used by Mission and Payload Specialists during launch The crew has to get out of the LES suits and stow them securely in a spot where they are out of the way until landing preparations begin personal side linteris htm images launpixs htm video more info launinfo htm home page launtriv htm home page livework htm Curator signatur htm Simone
