html 705 600 Printer Friendly Version Six small high technology firms have been selected by NASA Dryden Flight Research Center to receive research and development grants under Phase II of NASA s Small Business Innovative Research SBIR program The six firms proposals were among 145 selected for funding by NASA overall under the agency s 2002 SBIR program and are valued at up to 600 000 each over a two year performance period Three of the firms are located in California the remainder are in Virginia Texas and New Mexico The proposals fall into three research areas defined in the SBIR process including aviation safety engineering for complex systems and enabling concepts and technologies The firms and the titles of their winning proposals include Adherent Technologies Inc of Albuquerque N M UV rigid inflatable wing Williams Pyro Inc of Fort Worth Texas Embedded dual function arc fault circuit breaker locator based on OSA MATRA of Carmel Calif Finite element based fracture mechanics using multidisciplinary approach MetroLaser Inc of Irvine Calif Optical sensor for detection of fatigue damage precusors Tao of Systems Integration Inc of Williamsburg Va Real time aeroelastic measurement system RAMS for in flight flutter testing Rolling Hills Research Corporation of Torrance Calif Robust flow control for radically enhanced natural laminar flow wings Rodney Bogue NASA Dryden s SBIR program manager said the proposals were chosen based upon each firm s performance with an earlier Phase I SBIR project Phase I awards are for the purpose of proving a proposed concept and are funded up to a maximum of 70 000 for a six month period Bogue explained Phase II selections are made from high performing Phase I projects and are oriented to development of a marketable product Between 40 and 50 percent of Phase I contracts are selected for the Phase II follow on Overall 119 small high technology firms in 29 states will share in about 86 5 million in SBIR Phase II grants awarded by NASA this year with several receiving more than one contract The 145 projects funded were selected from 251 proposals submitted by firms completing SBIR Phase I projects Each proposal was evaluated to determine if it met SBIR Phase I objectives and if it was a feasible research innovation to meet the aerospace agency s needs The NASA SBIR program is intended to stimulate technological innovation increase the use of small business including those firms owned by women and minorities in meeting federal research and development needs and increase private sector commercialization of innovations derived from federally funded research The program is managed at NASA s Goddard Space Flight Center Greenbelt Md with oversight from NASA s Office of Aerospace Technology Washington D C Individual SBIR projects are selected and managed by each of NASA s 10 field centers SBIR Phase II project summaries Bogue provided the following summaries of each winning proposal Adherent Technologies Inc UV rigid inflatable wing The ability to rapidly deploy rigid structures in the atmosphere or in space is a major benefit to many types of terrestrial and space based missions Under this grant Adherent Technologies will develop and assess the performance of materials configured as structural elements in applications such as space based antennas satellite structures and mirrors The materials will also have applications for remotely operated aircraft and terrestrial spinoffs such as splints for medical treatment and inflatable shelters The innovative aspect of this concept is the ability to deploy a flexible object of specially formulated material and through a rapid curing process based on ultra violet light irradiation transform the object into a stiff and rigid load bearing structural element Williams Pyro Inc Embedded dual function arc fault circuit breaker locator based on OSA The contract calls for the firm to develop a miniaturized system to locate the position of electrical faults in aircraft cables This capability increases aircraft safety by detecting cable faults and will shorten the time needed to find and repair cable defects MATRA Finite element based fracture mechanics using multidisciplinary approach This activity will develop the understanding of how to analyze and predict mechanical failures in materials using existing analytical methods This capability would allow mechanical failures to be predicted in aircraft and space vehicles thus increasing overall safety MetroLaser Inc Optical sensor for detection of fatigue damage precursors Over 90 percent of mechanical failures are the result of fatigue damage MetroLaser s SBIR work will develop and evaluate a material fatigue sensor capable of monitoring the onset of fatigue so that incipient failures can be identified and repaired before failure to improve safety Tao of Systems Integration Real time aeroelastic measurement system RAMS for in flight flutter testing Unsteady surface airflow information on conventional aircraft wings and helicopter blades is needed during flight testing and is useful for health monitoring to avoid dangerous conditions such as flutter uncontrolled vibration and buffet This activity will develop and evaluate conformal surface flow detectors to assess structural interactions and avoid dangerous situations to improve the safety of aircraft flight testing Rolling Hills Research Corporation Robust flow control for radically enhanced natural laminar flow wings A technique called stagnation point control can be used to substantially improve aircraft wing performance reduce aerodynamic drag and increase lift by increasing the range of natural laminar or smooth airflow over the wing This work will focus on validating a compliant structure trailing edge flap system developed in the Phase I work for stagnation point control nasa Note to Editors blank space image of gray corner bottomskip Skip bottom nav bar link
