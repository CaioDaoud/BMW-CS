scientists are stoked It s Jason 1 dude For the past 10 years oceanographers from all over the world have been riding wave after wave of amazing sea surface height SSH data Orbiting from 1336 kilometers 830 miles in space the NASA CNES TOPEX Poseidon spacecraft keeps cranking out never before seen views of our Ocean Planet At the same time the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration s NOAA Polar Orbiting Satellites have been measuring the sea surface temperature SST of all our oceans These images and animations complement each other in many many ways for scientists their sum is much more than each individually time series anim html Time series animated gif MONTHLY TIME SERIES ANIMATIONS Click on the animated gif above to get to the time series anim html SSH and SST animations page The temperature data show us the warmer and cooler than normal sea surface temperatures that influence our atmosphere every day while sea surface heights are a measure of how much heat is stored in the ocean below The differences between what we see and what is normal are called anomalies When you put these two critical pieces of the climate puzzle together the SST s tell us about what is influencing today s weather and the SSH s tell us how much heat is being stored in the ocean to influence future planetary climate events MONTHLY TIME SERIES IMAGES time series images html Time series image example We invite you to surf through the world s oceans from the early 90 s into the 21st century There are waves of information here that others have missed and much more to learn from these revolutionary data From professional both ocean and atmospheric scientists to interested students and the public grab your computer surfboards and enjoy your TOPEX Poseidon surfing safari time series images html Check out the Monthly Time Series Images WHAT ARE WE LOOKING AT On these pages you are going to be viewing anomalies What is an anomaly Simply an anomaly is something that is outside of a range of what we consider to be normal In this case the anomalies are data points of sea surface height and sea surface temperature that stray away from a range of normal variations in height and temperature for the specified time of year The normal slow regular patterns of sea surface height and temperature are moved up and down warm and cool with the normal progression of the seasons winter to spring to summer to fall To better view the largest year to year variations of the 90 s a normal annual signal has been removed from these data The years 1993 through 1996 have been chosen as normal because of a lack of any large El Ni o or La Ni a signal This same time period was used to calculate a normal year for both SST and SSH maps and to calculate the monthly anomalies Repeating what our charts are these SSH and SST anomaly maps are defined as the difference between the satellite measured SSH and SST and the normal SSH and SST for that time of year and location This allows the best visualization of climate events such as the El Ni o La Ni a and Pacific Decadal Oscillation Sea surface height is shown relative to normal with normal shown as green Blue and purple areas represent heights measuring between 8 and 24 centimeters 3 and 9 inches lower than normal Red and white areas represent higher than normal sea surface heights and indicate warmer water These areas are between 8 and 24 centimeters 3 and 9 inches higher than normal SSH color bar SST color bar WHY NEW DATA These images and animations of sea surface height and sea surface
