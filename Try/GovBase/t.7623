administrator from 1961 1968 JWST Kids Corner The James Webb Space Telescope or JWST will take the place of the very popular Hubble Space Telescope JWST is scheduled to launch in the year 2011 It will be built by a company called Northrop Grumman Space Technology at a cost of about 825 million Why you might ask are we building another space telescope if Hubble still works Hubble won t last forever and we need to begin planning and building something to take its place many years in advance Hubble has been in space for almost 14 years and is only expected to last another 6 years Also the technology used on Hubble is fairly old Hubble was built using technology from the early 1980 s whereas JWST will include new state of the art technology When you talk about telescopes the most important number is the size of the primary mirror JWST s mirror will be quite a bit larger than Hubble s mirror meaning it will be able to collect more light JWST s mirror will be about 21 feet across 6 5 meters while Hubble s is only about 7 feet across 2 4 m For comparison JWST s mirror will be almost as tall as 5 fourth graders stacked on top of each other JWST will also observe a different kind of light than Hubble Hubble collects visible light just like your eye But there are other kinds of light that you cannot see Heat for instance is a kind of light That is the light JWST will collect Scientists call it infra red light Another question you might have is why do astronomers want to see heat Well think about it this way you may not be able to tell a stove is hot by looking at it but you ll definitely know if you touch it Similarly astronomers can see different processes that they wouldn t normally be able to study with visible light One thing astronomers hope to see with JWST is the light from the first generation of stars that were born after the Big Bang To do this we need to collect light from very far away Since light travels at a constant speed the further away the light comes from the further back in time we are looking I know you re confused now so let s explore this a little further Light travels at a constant speed of about 186 000 miles per second That seems really fast and it is but in the universe things are so far away that even at that speed it takes the light a long time to reach us The sun for instance is so far away that it takes the light 8 minutes to reach us So we actually see the sun as it looked 8 minutes ago So you can see how it might be possible to see something that occurred 12 billion years ago by looking far enough away Astronomy Links for Kids http starchild gsfc nasa gov docs StarChild StarChild html STARCHILD http liftoff msfc nasa gov LIFTOFF http kids msfc nasa gov NASAKIDS http www windows ucar edu tour
