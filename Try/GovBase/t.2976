Program Evaluation of the Hazardous Materials Transportation Programs In March 2000 a ONE DOT team from the Office of Inspector General United States Coast Guard Federal Aviation Administration Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration Federal Railroad Administration and Research and Special Programs Administration completed a DOT wide Program Evaluation of the Hazardous Materials Transportation Programs HMPE The program evaluation had two broad objectives Objective I was to document current hazardous materials movements Operating Administrations programs and program delivery Objective II was to assess the effectiveness of DOT s overall hazardous materials program as it affects each step in the hazardous materials transportation process from packaging to receiver recommend improvements and identify areas for further analysis and action The team found that DOT s hazardous materials program works reasonably well but needs to be improved through DOT wide strategic planning
