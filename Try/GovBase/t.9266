shtml Laboratory instruments capturing the sun on NASAsGenesis mission A Message from Terry Hawkins Houston T Hawkins The proliferation of nuclear biological and chemical weapons of mass destruction javascript is widely recognized today as the most serious threat to the security of the United States since the end of the Cold War In this ominous context proliferation also includes the sobering prospect that terrorists may acquire and use these weapons against our citizens The Nonproliferation and International Security NIS Division was established at Los Alamos National Laboratory in 1993 to respond to this growing threat NIS reports to the Associate director for http www lanl gov orgs tr Threat Reduction Our mission to deter detect and respond to proliferation is a major component of the Laboratory s core mission to reduce the global nuclear danger Accomplishing this mission requires the dedicated efforts and talents of some of the best and brightest scientists and engineers working in multidisciplinary teams on highly complex problems Many NIS employees have advanced degrees in atmospheric and space sciences astrophysics nuclear physics computer sciences biology chemistry and engineering of all types and this is only a partial list of the skills we need to do the job Because our work is science based we work with universities and other research laboratories around the world Because there is little margin for error in our work we work in partnership with some of the very best high technology companies Because of the international aspects of the problem we collaborate with institutes and scientists around the world to prevent the migration of nuclear materials and technologies into illicit proliferation programs Most of all we derive the satisfaction that comes from accepting the challenge and producing unique products that make a difference to the safety and security of everyone The men and women of NIS are proud to play a major role in reducing the global danger The relevance and quality of our efforts is validated annually by a panel of outside experts from government academia and industry The NIS Division Review Committee groups nis drc index shtml NISDRC awarded NIS Division the highest possible ranking of Outstanding for the quality and relevance of its science and technology programs for the past five years NIS Division is world class not only in our science and technology but also in our conduct of operations The Division was awarded the 1999 Business Management Award for our outstanding performance in the combined management of finance procurement and property and our electrical safety program has been recognized as best in class in the Laboratory The Nonproliferation and International Security Center nisrd nonproliferation center shtml NISC a new laboratory office complex will be ready for occupancy during fiscal year 2003 This new facility will consolidate most of NIS division thereby further enhancing our effectiveness I hope you will take time to get to know us better If you have questions or comments I would like to hear from you Houston T Hawkins Division Leader Nonproliferation and
