and relevant subpopulations when applicable Procedures for data flow data management data quality and database integrity and security should be described If appropriate a plan for data sharing should be included Human Subjects Research Section Incomplete information concerning the use of human subjects may affect the scientific merit rating Unless your proposed clinical studies are described by one or more of the exemptions in the human subjects regulations 45 CFR46 101 b see also PHS 398 the following should be addressed in a section entitled protection of human subjects risks to the

Plan DSMP Investigators Clinical projects often require a multidisciplinary team of investigators The involvement and contribution of the investigators to the clinical aspects of the project should be described The expertise of the investigators should mach the study population e g investigators with pediatric expertise should be included if the study involves a pediatric population Environment
