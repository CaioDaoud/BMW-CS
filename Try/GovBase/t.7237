Hamitic constitute most of the population The Bantu are the most numerous and include the Baganda which with 18 of the population constitute the largest single ethnic group The people of the southwest comprise 30 of the population divided into five major ethnic groups the Banyankole and Bahima 10 the Bakiga 8 the Banyarwanda 6 the Bunyoro 3 and the Batoro 3 Residents of the north largely Nilotic are the next largest group including the Langi 6 and the Acholi 4 In the northwest are the Lugbara 4 The Karamojong 2 occupy the considerably drier largely pastoral territory in the northeast Europeans Asians and Arabs make up about 1 of the population with other groups accounting for the remainder Uganda s population is predominately rural and its density population highest in the southern regions Until 1972 Asians constituted the largest nonindigenous ethnic group in Uganda In that year the Idi Amin regime expelled 50 000 Asians who had been engaged in trade industry and various professions In the years since Amin s overthrow in 1979 Asians have slowly returned About 3 000 Arabs of various national origins and small numbers of Asians live in Uganda Other nonindigenous people in Uganda include several hundred Western missionaries and a few diplomats and businesspeople When Arab traders moved inland from their enclaves along the Indian Ocean coast of East Africa and reached the interior of Uganda in the 1830s they found several African kingdoms with well developed political institutions dating back several centuries These traders were followed in the 1860s by British explorers searching for the source of the Nile River Protestant missionaries entered the country in 1877 followed by Catholic missionaries in 1879 In 1888 control of the emerging British sphere of interest in East Africa was assigned by royal charter to the Imperial British East Africa Company an arrangement strengthened in 1890 by an Anglo German agreement confirming British dominance over Kenya and Uganda The high cost of occupying the territory caused the company to withdraw in 1893 and its administrative functions were taken over by a British commissioner In 1894 the Kingdom of Buganda was placed under a formal British protectorate Britain granted internal self government to Uganda in 1961 with the first elections held on March 1 1961 Benedicto Kiwanuka of the Democratic Party became the first Chief Minister Uganda maintained its Commonwealth membership In succeeding years supporters of a centralized state vied with those in favor of a loose federation and a strong role for tribally based local kingdoms Political maneuvering climaxed in February 1966 when Prime Minister Milton Obote suspended the constitution assumed all government powers and removed the president and vice president In September 1967 a new constitution proclaimed Uganda a republic gave the president even greater powers and abolished the traditional kingdoms On January 25 1971 Obote s government was ousted in a military coup led by armed forces commander Idi Amin Dada Amin declared himself president dissolved the parliament and amended the constitution to give himself absolute power Idi Amin s 8 year rule produced economic decline social disintegration and massive human rights violations The Acholi and Langi ethnic groups were particular objects of Amin s political persecution because they had supported Obote and made up a large part of the army In 1978 the International Commission of Jurists estimated that more than 100 000 Ugandans had been murdered during Amin s reign of terror some authorities place the figure much higher In October 1978 Tanzanian armed forces repulsed an incursion of Amin s troops into Tanzanian territory The Tanzanian force backed by Ugandan exiles waged a war of liberation against Amin s troops and Libyan soldiers sent to help him On April 11 1979 Kampala was captured and Amin fled with his remaining forces After Amin s removal the Uganda National Liberation Front formed an interim government with Yusuf Lule as president This government adopted a ministerial system of administration and created a quasi parliamentary organ known as the National Consultative Commission NCC The NCC and the Lule cabinet reflected widely differing political views In June 1979 following a dispute over the extent of presidential powers the NCC replaced Lule with Godfrey Binaisa In a continuing dispute over the powers of the interim presidency Binaisa was removed in May 1980 Thereafter Uganda was ruled by a military commission chaired by Paulo Muwanga The December 1980 elections returned the UPC to power under the leadership of President Obote with Muwanga serving as vice president Under Obote the security forces had one of the world s worst human rights records In their efforts to stamp out an insurgency led by Yoweri Museveni s National Resistance Army NRA they laid waste to a substantial section of the country especially in the Luwero area north of Kampala Obote ruled until July 27 1985 when an army brigade composed mostly of ethnic Acholi troops and commanded by Lt Gen Basilio Olara Okello took Kampala and proclaimed a military government Obote fled to exile in Zambia The new regime headed by former defense force commander Gen Tito Okello no relation to Lt Gen Olara Okello opened negotiations with Museveni s insurgent forces and pledged to improve respect for human rights end tribal rivalry and conduct free and fair elections In the meantime massive human rights violations continued as the Okello government murdered civilians and ravaged the countryside in order to destroy the NRA s support Negotiations between the Okello government and the NRA were conducted in Nairobi in the fall of 1985 with Kenyan President Daniel Moi seeking a cease fire and a coalition government in Uganda Although agreeing in late 1985 to a cease fire the NRA continued fighting seized Kampala in late January 1986 and assumed control of the country forcing Okello to flee north into Sudan Museveni s forces organized a government with Museveni as president Since assuming power the government dominated by the political grouping created by Museveni and his followers the National Resistance Movement NRM or the Movement has largely put an end to the human rights abuses of earlier governments initiated substantial political liberalization and general press freedom and instituted broad economic reforms after consultation with the International Monetary Fund IMF World Bank and donor governments A referendum was held in March 2000 on whether Uganda should retain the Movement system or adopt multi party politics Although 70 of voters endorsed retention of the Movement system the referendum was widely criticized for low voter turnout and unfair restrictions on Movement opponents Museveni was reelected to a second five year term in March 2001 Parliamentary elections were held in June 2001 and more than 50 of contested seats were won by newcomers Movement supporters nevertheless remained in firm control of the legislative branch Observers believed that the 2001 presidential and parliamentary elections generally reflected the will of the electorate however both were marred by serious irregularities particularly in the period leading up to the elections such as restrictions on political party activities incidents of violence voter intimidation and fraud In 2001 the Constitutional Review Commission CRC began soliciting opinions and holding public hearings on amending the 1995 Constitution The CRC was set up to examine the constitutional provisions relating to sovereignty political systems democracy and good governance Its report scheduled for release by October 2003 has not yet been delivered to Cabinet or made public The Cabinet however presented a list of its suggestions for constitutional change to the CRC in September These changes included the introduction of a full multiparty system an increase in executive authority vis vis the other branches and the lifting of presidential term limits The elimination of term limits would clear the way for Museveni to run again in 2006 and there are increasing signs that he wishes to do so However this proposal has also produced significant controversy and it is not yet clear when or how the constitution will be changed The bizarre and cult like Lord s Resistance Army LRA continues to harass government forces and murder and kidnap civilians in the north and east Although the LRA does not threaten the stability of the government LRA violence has displaced 1 2 million people and created a humanitarian crisis The Uganda Peoples Defense Force UPDF launched Operation Iron Fist against LRA rebels in northern Uganda in 2002 and conducted operations against LRA sanctuaries in southern Sudan with the permission of the Sudanese Government Uganda and Sudan have resumed diplomatic relations and exchanged Ambassadors however Uganda continues to accuse Sudan of supporting the LRA Sudan denies the allegations In 1998 Uganda deployed a sizable military force to eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo DRC ostensibly to prevent attacks from Ugandan rebel groups operating there There were widespread allegations that Ugandan military and civilian officials were involved in the illegal exploitation of DRC natural resources After much international pressure Uganda withdrew its troops from DRC in June 2003 GOVERNMENT Yoweri Museveni is the President and the Commander in Chief Dr

Washington DC 20011 tel 202 726 7100 ECONOMY Uganda s economy has great potential Endowed with significant natural resources including ample fertile land regular rainfall and mineral deposits it appeared poised for rapid economic growth and development at independence However chronic political instability and erratic economic management produced a record of persistent economic decline that left Uganda among the world s poorest and least developed countries After the turmoil of the Amin era the country began a program of economic recovery in 1981 that received considerable foreign assistance From mid 1984 on however overly expansionist fiscal and monetary policies and the renewed outbreak of civil strife led to a setback in economic performance Since assuming power in early 1986 Museveni s government has taken important steps toward economic rehabilitation The country s infrastructure notably its transportation and communications systems which were destroyed by war and neglect is being rebuilt Recognizing the need for increased external support Uganda negotiated a policy framework paper with the IMF and the World Bank in 1987 It subsequently began implementing economic policies designed to restore price stability and sustainable balance of payments improve capacity utilization rehabilitate infrastructure restore producer incentives through proper price policies and improve resource mobilization and allocation in the public sector These policies produced positive results Inflation which ran at 240 in 1987 and 42 in June 1992 was 5 4 for fiscal year 1995 96 and 7 3 in 2003 Investment as a percentage of GDP was estimated at 20 9 in 2002 compared to 13 7 in 1999 Private sector investment largely financed by private transfers from abroad was 14 9 of GDP in 2002 Gross national savings as a percentage of GDP was estimated at 5 5 in 2002 The Ugandan Government has also worked with donor countries to reschedule or cancel substantial portions of the country s external debts Agricultural products supply nearly all of Uganda s foreign exchange earnings with coffee alone of which Uganda is Africa s leading producer accounting for about 27 of the country s exports in 2002 Exports of apparel hides skins vanilla vegetables fruits cut flowers and fish are growing and cotton tea and tobacco continue to be mainstays Most industry is related to agriculture The industrial sector is being rehabilitated to resume production of building and construction materials such as cement reinforcing rods corrugated roofing sheets and paint Domestically

international airport is at Entebbe on the shore of Lake Victoria some 32 kilometers 20 mi south of Kampala FOREIGN RELATIONS The Ugandan Government generally seeks good relations with other nations without reference to ideological orientation Relations with Rwanda Congo and Sudan have sometimes been strained because of security concerns President Museveni has been active in attempts implement a peace agreement Burundi and has supported peace initiatives in Sudan and Somalia In the past neighbors were concerned about Uganda s relationship with Libya which had supplied military equipment and bartered fuel to Uganda In addition to its friendly ties to Western nations Uganda has maintained ties with North Korea Uganda s has strained relations with Sudan because of alleged Sudanese support for the LRA The LRA seeks to overthrow the Uganda Government and has inflicted brutal violence on the population in northern Uganda including rape kidnapping torture and murder In 2002 Uganda and Sudan reestablished diplomatic ties and signed a protocol permitting the UPDF to enter southern Sudan and engage the LRA The protocol must be renewed periodically and has lapsed at least twice since it was signed Another rebel group operating in western Uganda and eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo near the Rwenzori Mountains the Allied Democratic Forces emerged as a localized threat in 1996 and inflicted substantial suffering on the population in the area It has largely been defeated by the UPDF and the areas secured DEFENSE The Uganda Peoples Defense Force UPDF previously the

military assistance U S UGANDAN RELATIONS Although U S Ugandan relations were strained during the rule of Idi Amin in the 1970s relations improved after Amin s fall In mid 1979 the United States reopened its embassy in Kampala Relations with successor governments were cordial although Obote and his administration rejected strong U S criticism of Uganda s human rights situation Bilateral relations between the United States and Uganda have been good since Museveni assumed power and the United States has welcomed his efforts to end human rights abuses and to pursue economic reform Uganda is a strong supporter of the global war against terrorism The United States is helping Uganda achieve export led economic growth through the African Growth and Opportunities Act and provides a significant amount of development assistance At the same time the United States is concerned about continuing human rights problems the pace of progress toward the establishment of genuine political
