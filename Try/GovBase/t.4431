Kevin Coakley a mathematical statistician in the Statistical Engineering Division is one of five holders of a patent on the invention of a new technique to measure the residual stress on a structure Coakley helped to develop the measurement technique in collaboration with colleagues in NIST s Materials Science and Engineering Laboratory James Filliben Statistical Engineering Division was named a Fellow of the American Statistical Association Filliben was recognized for exemplary work in statistical consulting with physical scientists and engineers for leadership in the development of statistical software and for technical contributions of national importance The announcement appeared in the October issue of Amstat News the membership magazine of the American Statistical
