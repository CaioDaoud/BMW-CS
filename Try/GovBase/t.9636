Service vBNS The vBNS is a nationwide network that supports high performance high bandwidth research applications Launched in 1995 it is the product of a 5 year cooperative agreement between NSF and MCI Approximately 100 research institutions chosen through a peer review process will be connected to the network It currently connects 92 institutions and operates at 622 megabits per second with an expectation of 2 4 gigabits per second by the year 2000 The vBNS is expected to always be several steps ahead of commercially available networking federal ngi Other Federal Networks fed activities
