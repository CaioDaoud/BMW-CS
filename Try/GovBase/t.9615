Ex Officio Representative for the Association of Independent California Colleges and Universities Dr Gallagher is currently the Emery Stoops and Joyce King Stoops Dean of the Rossier School of Education at the University of Southern California Ex Officio Representative Gallagher thanked Chair Fortune for the warm welcome and said it will be an honor to represent the 41 private universities that have departments of education and that prepare more than 40 percent of teachers who are credentialed each year in California Chair Fortune also announced with regret that Dr Marilyn Whirry who has served as the Designee of the Superintendent of Public Instruction for the past two and a half years is leaving the Commission Currently an adjunct professor at Loyola Marymount University Dr Whirry is a nationally recognized reading methods expert and was a high school English teacher for more than 30 years She has been both a state and national Teacher of the Year On the Commission she has been an active participant during a time of expansive credentialing reform Chair Fortune thanked her for her many contributions In return Dr Whirry thanked Chair Fortune and the other Commissioners for their camaraderie and said it has been an honor to work with such intelligent committed and dedicated people Commissioner Vaca spoke about the two emotions Dr Whirry inspires awe because of her extensive experience and knowledge and a sense of comfort because of her ability to put people at ease He said she has a remarkable gift for teaching and that he has felt privileged to learn from her Chair Fortune then presented Dr Whirry with a plaque and a poster with artwork that represents students and their hopes for the future Chair Fortune also announced that Commissioner Boquiren was recently married to a teacher in the Lawndale Elementary School District and is missing the Commission s meeting while she is on her honeymoon Finally Chair Fortune said the Annual Report chronicling the achievements of the Commission during 2002 is now available At the next meeting she will present a State of the Commission address to provide an overview of those accomplishments and to set the stage for the coming year EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR S REPORT Executive Director Swofford joined Chair Fortune in welcoming Dr Gallagher expressing regret for Dr Whirry s departure and congratulating Commissioner Boquiren on her marriage In addition he informed the Commission that Dannetta Garcia of the Office of Governmental Relations was recently honored with an Assembly Resolution for her work as an advisory team member on the Joint Committee on Preparing California for the 21st Century Ms Garcia contributed greatly toward the development of the Legislature s goals for racial and ethnic inclusion She was selected as a member in part because of her extensive work with the League of Women Voters She has also been active in the formation of the city of Elk Grove Executive Director Swofford asked Cheryl Hickey of the Professional Services Division to come forward and brief the Commission on the proposed federal Ready to Teach Act At the last Commission meeting Ms Hickey provided an overview of the proposed legislation which is the first in a series of bills to reauthorize the Higher Education Act The Ready to Teach Act affects only the Title 2 portion of the act and seeks to align teacher training with the provisions and intent of the No Child Left Behind Act NCLB In essence Ms Hickey said the Higher Education Act is the path for getting to the highly qualified teachers required in NCLB Ms Hickey said the Ready to Teach Act has already passed out of the House of Representatives and is awaiting its first hearing in the Senate Since the administration is expected to put forth its own proposal after the first of the year it is unlikely that the Ready to Teach Act will be passed this year Nonetheless it is important for the Commission to be aware of the direction of the bill and the discussions around its provisions Ms Hickey said the content has two major components teacher quality enhancement grants and reporting requirements The grants promote activities that will bring teacher training into alignment with NCLB including the development of alternative routes to certification merit based pay systems alignment with academic content standards etc The reporting requirements involve two major changes First reporting by institutions currently involves data such as pass rates for program completers This will change with institutions required to report data for anyone who has taken 50 percent or more of program requirements This will allow the measurement of the quality of teacher preparation programs for all students not just those who complete the program Second states will be required to report on the link between teacher candidate skills and content knowledge and evidence of student achievement Ms Hickey said discussions in the Capitol indicate that Congress is using the reauthorization bill as a vehicle to pressure teacher preparation programs to bring their content into alignment with NCLB and to ensure that programs are of high quality Executive Director Swofford said staff will continue to keep the Commission abreast of the reauthorization progress because of its role in implementing whatever is eventually passed Ex Officio Representative Wilson said that under a Ford Foundation grant CSU is working on a feasibility study on the link between teacher preparation and student academic achievement He said such a link is not easy to accomplish but that CSU believes it is an important step The study is receiving cooperation from three large urban school districts with others possibly joining in He said he will keep the Commission informed as the project moves forward Ex Officio Representative Lundquist said that it is important that the Commission not be misinterpreted as doing anything that deviates from support for advancing student academic achievement She said however that Dr Swofford is correct that the complexity of any process adopted by the federal government and its implications for paralyzing the teacher preparation system needs to be watched carefully by the Commission and addressed in a credible manner REPORT ON MONTHLY STATE BOARD MEETING A summary of the key items of interest to the Commission that were discussed at the June and July meetings of the State Board of Education were included in the agenda packet This included actions taken by the Board to comply with the No Child Left Behind requirement for a state plan and a state definition of highly qualified teacher ALIGNMENT OF CREDENTIAL REQUIREMENTS TO CONFORM TO STATE BOARD OF EDUCATION S NCLB PLAN Chair Fortune said that Commission staff and State Board of Education staff have collaborated closely during the past weeks as California moved to address the requirements of the No Child Left Behind Act She said the Commission values the relationship and partnership as the state moves into implementation mode Karen Steentofte Chief Counsel for the State Board of Education and Mary Armstrong General Counsel for the Commission presented an overview of the alignment requirements Ms Armstrong told the Commission that the State Board has now adopted a state plan to comply with NCLB and has defined highly qualified teacher as outlined on page 88 of the agenda materials She said key elements are that elementary school teachers will have to pass a subject matter test while middle school and high school teachers will need to complete a major or equivalent for subjects that they teach Those teaching on emergency permits and waivers will not be considered highly qualified Ms Armstrong said the Commission has been asked to consider the actions that need to be taken to align teacher credentialing policies and processes with NCLB and the state plan Four issues have been identified and will be addressed in items GS 10 A through GS 10 D Each deals with a different aspect of the Commission s current policies that may conflict with the state plan these are covered by a chart on pages 106 07 in the agenda packet She said that at each step of the process staff has consulted with various stakeholders regarding how to balance realities with the state plan and NCLB requirements Staff has worked closely with the State Board staff to make sure that proposals do not conflict with the state plan Ms Steentofte thanked the Commission for its close cooperation She said at the moment the State Board s proposed regulations are in a public comment period A public hearing will be conducted on Sept 9 at which point the Board will consider public comments The adoption of the proposed regulations will be considered on Sept 11 at which point the Board could amend the regulations If they are amended a new public review period will begin with adoption delayed until October or November She said that while the Board hopes to be able to adopt the regulations in September they may be impacted by new guidance that the U S Department of Education expects to issue in September Ms Steentofte emphasized that the Commission has a very important role in certifying and validating any statewide exam She said the Board appreciates how expeditiously the Commission is moving to certify test options Since many details may need to be addressed as the plan is implemented she said the Board appreciates the fact that Commission staff and Board staff are committed to working together She said the Board is working with Commission staff on a guide to help school districts implement NCLB once the state plan and regulations are in place GS 10 A PROPOSED REVISION OF MULTIPLE SUBJECT CREDENTIALING REQUIREMENTS TO ALIGN WITH REQUIREMENTS OF STATE BOARD OF EDUCATION S NCLB PLAN Amy Jackson Administrator with the Professional Services Division presented this item Before she began Chair Fortune noted that deans of the schools of education for both the CSU and UC systems have sought more time to work on issues She said the Commission asked the State Board for more time and was told that the State Board can meet its requirements as long as the Commission approves conceptual action at the current meeting and takes final action at the October meeting In order to meet deadlines for agenda material there will be a three week window for input She said it is important for the stakeholders to know that they were heard and that they will have an opportunity for input Ms Jackson summarized the proposed options for revising the multiple subject credentialing requirements to align with the state plan for NCLB To meet the State Board plan candidates would need to take and pass a rigorous state test approved by the Commission Commission staff have identified four options Option 1 Revise Standard 6 which covers the assessment of subject matter competence Option 2 Find current approved programs not eligible for the examination waiver Option 3 Adopt a combination of Options 1 and 2 Option 4 Continue current credential requirements span class majortext The language proposed for Option 1 calls for a rigorous uniform summative assessment with passage of a subject matter examination prior to entering a teacher preparation program The approval of subject matter programs would not change Exam choices could include CSET the current multiple subject exam or another state or national exam as long as it is rigorous Institutions of Higher Education IHEs could also develop exams that could then be submitted for approval to the Commission IHEs would be required to resubmit their programs for Standard 6 and the Commission would expedite the revision and submission process Option 2 addresses the fact that the Education Code currently allows a waiver of an exam for candidates completing Commission approved multiple subject programs By having the Commission find that no currently approved multiple subject programs meet the state plan Option 2 would preclude exam waivers all candidates would be required to demonstrate subject matter competency by passing an exam Under Option 3 the Commission would revise Standard 6 to require an embedded culminating exam which would result in all approved programs resubmitting their response to Standard 6 Prior to new approval no programs would be eligible for exam waivers and all students would need to take an exam Option 4 continuing with current requirements would not be compliant with the state plan and NCLB Ms Jackson said depending on which option is adopted by the Commission Title 5 regulations may need to be addressed If that were the case staff would bring back language for consideration at the October meeting including changes required for blended programs In addition to the four options Ms Jackson presented five alternatives for implementation timelines The option would be effective immediately subject to regulatory changes if necessary The option would be effective January 2004 Examinations would be required immediately for information purposes with full implementation of the option by July 1 2006 The option would be effective July 1 2005 the anticipated completion date for candidates now in approved programs The option would be effective July 1 2005 in order for the Commission to seek any necessary legislative changes span class majortext Chair Fortune invited public input and the following people spoke Sharon Robison Association of California School Administrators said her organization is interested in emphasizing terms such as flexibility options and sufficient time for implementation She said ACSA continues to want highly qualified teachers in the classroom but that the key in working toward that end is flexible options She said ACSA would like to see CSET as one of the approved assessments while options remain open for other assessments Chair Fortune asked her to elaborate on other assessments Ms Robison responded that ACSA believes the option for IHEs to develop their own assessments should be left open Barbara Huff Los Angeles Unified School District said she has great difficulty with the phrase highly qualified being attached to teachers who have no classroom experience She said she hopes that the misleading and inaccurate term will be replaced Highly qualified teachers may fit those with five years of teaching but it is not a fitting label simply because someone has passed an exam and is beginning to teach She said it is a label that is very misleading for the public Randall Souviney University of California drew attention to a set of comments that faculty and the Office of the UC provided to the Commission He said he would not repeat the detailed discussion but wanted to highlight several items First he said that he and his colleagues are already placing students in school as interns and that it would be helpful if the Commission would reconfirm that the students are verified as subject matter competent under current law and that these students will be highly qualified under the federal definition Second he said that a number of issues around single subject credentials also need to be addressed promptly and resolved And finally he said there is a potential conflict in state regulations regarding the Governor Teacher Fellowships Cal Grants and Apple loans If students graduating and looking for jobs will now no longer be highly qualified they may not be able to get jobs and their grants will have to be paid back He said several hundred to several thousand from this year s program have completed their credentials and will not be able to get a job in Title 1 schools Under grants and loans they have one year to get a job and start having their loans forgiven but that won t be possible if they can t get a job because they aren t highly qualified Patricia Rucker California Teachers Association said the CTA is concerned about implementation of whatever option the Commission selects She said there should be due diligence given to maximizing flexibility and creating multiple options for candidates who will be affected She said the Commission should not overlook that teachers who have been certified since July 1 2001 when NCLB was passed are adversely affected The longer the timeline for implementation the bigger the pool of impacted teachers will be So even though flexibility and maximum timelines are important there is a negative impact on the workforce and those in the pipeline She said the CTA asks that once the Commission makes its decisions it should provide coded correspondence and also try to identify those in both the workforce and the pipeline who are affected so that the Commission can look at options for supporting them She also urged the Commission to look at the impact on IHEs She said it is most important that any test be of equal rigor so that candidates do not choose programs based on how easy it is to pass the test She said the Commission should also be aware that requiring passage of CSET will impact the diversity that will enter the workforce She said CTA will continue to work with the Commission on the issues Stephanie Farland California School Boards Association said her organization is primarily concerned with options that would require candidates to pass a rigorous exam prior to being accepted into a credential program She said she fears this will be a barrier for many potential candidates they will not be invested in the credential program and so may well turn to some other career This would result in a smaller pool of teachers to choose from She said CSBA also favors flexibility for teacher candidates if they can t pass CSET on the first try They should be allowed to retake the exam while in the credential program She said there are a lot of reasons that a person may not pass an exam but that many of them may make fine teachers if they are not choked off while they are still in the pipeline Dr Maria Marin San Diego Coalition and Vice President of InterAmerican College said several colleges in the San Diego area have come together around this issue to provide input They are concerned about accreditation based on passing scores She said they are meeting with community colleges to make sure their syllabus meets standards and she encouraged the Commission to bring community colleges to the table since that is where so many students begin their subject matter competence education She said she believes minority students many of whom attend community colleges will particularly feel the impact of the new requirements She said community colleges should receive CSET scores so they can assess whether their curriculum is meeting standards She said she also favors students being allowed to take test sections separately so that if they don t pass some sections they can obtain remedial assistance in just the areas that they need help in She also asked that the State Board and the Commission write to students who may otherwise blame the colleges for blocking them from getting credentials rather than understanding that these are new state requirements She said that she is confident that Latinos can pass the test but that they may need more time because they are English language learners and it takes longer for them to read and understand content Dr Mel Hunt speaking as a member of the public said a proposal to demonstrate subject matter competence by passing CSET and making that a teacher prep program admission requirement would limit the flexibility that programs now have Currently subject matter competence is a requirement for daily student teaching so that programs have the opportunity to admit people into the program get them committed and then help them pass the test He said 60 percent of people who get credentials do so by the exam route and only 40 percent do so by subject matter programs He said the 40 percent have been the focus and up until now they are the only ones impacted But by making passing the test an entrance requirement it affects all 100 percent As an alternative he suggested it remain a requirement for daily student teaching so that people can enter a teacher preparation program before passing the test Otherwise people may fail to pass the test and decide to not enter the program Chair Fortune then turned to Commissioners for comment Vice Chair Madkins said he wanted to praise staff for working hard to follow the twists and turns of NCLB and to accommodate the direction that Commissioners have provided He also thanks Chair Fortune for being courageous in seeking common ground and emphasizing the need to work together He said the Commission needs to continue with its collaborative approach with the goal of making NCLB implementation something that everyone can be proud of He said it is important to consider issues of timing both in terms of meeting federal requirements and in terms of giving those impacted time to do what is necessary Commissioner Hauk thanked the UC and CSU systems for their extensive and valuable input She said it raised excellent questions and was well thought out providing her with helpful insight Commissioner Lilly said he has changed his mind several times about how to address the issues but that is not surprising in such a complicated area Each time solutions are discussed new issues and problems pop up Nonetheless he said progress has been made and he believes the best course of action is Option 2 He said Option 2 makes it clear that programs that prepare candidates can t qualify them unless they take an examination However he said that he wants to see the language crafted in such a way that current subject matter programs are not denigrated He said there are several options for when the exam can be required The Commission can require that subject matter programs embed the exam and verify it during at or near the end of the program the Commission can require that it take place as condition of admission to teacher preparation programs or the Commission can require as it does now that the exam take place prior to daily student teaching If the third alternative is adopted then no action has to be taken because such a requirement is already in the program standards But the first order of business is to resolve the language in Option 2 and then adopt Option 2 Designee Whirry said that Option 4 is not really an option since is won t meet the NCLB requirements She said Options 1 and 3 are very similar but that her choice is to zero in on Option 2 and work with it Commissioner Johnson said that she believes it is important that in every discussion of this complicated issue that the concept be included that this was not the Commission s idea She said the Commission was already accomplishing credential reform including allowing people to demonstrate competence by taking course work rather than a test Such an option however is not being allowed by the federal government even though the Commission has found it very satisfactory The Commission has not been motivated to change its program and approach by any belief that it needs to be changed She said that every communication to credential candidates needs to say that circumstances outside of the Commission s control are responsible Otherwise credential candidates who entered the pipeline under one set of requirements and now face a different set may feel that we ve lied to them or misrepresented the case When the Commission began implementing SB 2042 reforms the idea of external federal mandates altering how we proceeded wasn t part of the picture but it is now and the Commission has to adjust She said the way that the California agencies have responded has been admirable though difficult She also agreed with the speaker who questioned the label highly qualified as being misleading when applied to teachers just starting out She said she prefers NCLB compliant teachers Ex Officio Representative Wilson said there has long been a perception that those entering the profession as elementary school teachers have a lack of subject matter knowledge This perception rather than reality has driven the requirements in NCLB At this point he said the Commission cannot do anything about it except work toward cooperative compliance As CSU has said in its letter he said that one goal should be to try not to entangle the requirement for a test with the teacher preparation programs Ex Officio Representative Gallagher said her organization does not have a formal position on the issue because its membership hasn t had the opportunity to vote on it but there is consensus on several issues The private universities do want more flexibility and options Their biggest concern is students who have passed requirements graduated completed programs been employed and are now facing the possibility of having to pass a test They have a credential that gave them access to the practice of teaching and now they will have to take a test that is linked to that credential and not to their status as an employee Ex Officio Representative Waite said she appreciates the enlightening comments from the field and the collaboration that is occurring Many of the concerns are shared including the impact on current students She said universities that she has talked to have sent letters to students and even to past graduates about the need to pass a test She said another important issue is the timing of the test She said she agrees with the speaker who advocated requiring passing the test before student teaching rather than as a condition of acceptance into a preparation program If they fail to pass the test but can still enter a preparation program they can receive assistance to help them pass Vice Chair Madkins made the following motion In order to meet teacher requirements for NCLB and provide ample opportunity for all stakeholders to provide input on this item I move that the Commission adopt the concept of requiring all candidates to pass CSET to obtain a credential Commission staff is directed to work with IHEs and other groups to develop details and any regulations that may be required and bring that proposal to the October meeting for action Commissioner Lilly seconded the motion Ex Officio Representative Waite asked if the motion was limited to CSET as the required test Executive Director Swofford said that the NCLB and state plan requirement is for a subject matter examination certified by the Commission and that currently the only certified test is CSET Vice Chair Madkins said he accepted wording about Commission certified subject matter examinations but wanted to ensure that nothing would affect the progress made on reciprocity with other states Executive Director Swofford pointed out that reciprocity is based on program equivalence rather than other states examinations at this point exams from other states are not accepted Chair Fortune summarized that what she heard from Commissioners was support for Option 2 and that the consultation with the field in the following weeks would focus on the timing and placement of the test Commissioner Lilly asked that the dialogue during the coming weeks also focus on language for implementing Option 2 that would be more palatable to existing approved programs Commissioner Johnson said the Commission should also use the time to consider ways to preserve the subject matter programs which under the new requirements will necessarily have a changed relationship with the Commission and the review process She said the Commission should craft something that ensures the option of taking a course of study to prepare so the test is not a problem She also said that course work needs to remain aligned with student academic content standards Ex Officio Representative Wilson said the last two comments by Commissioners Lilly and Johnson are important While not part of the motion they should become part of how to implement the motion Chair Fortune said the motion will stand as delivered by Vice Chair Madkins with staff understanding the direction and intent of the Commission to trigger Option 2 and to ensure that subject matter programs do due diligence to prepare candidates for the test The motion was approved with no dissent PUBLIC HEARING Proposed Amendment to Section 80020 1 of Title 5 California Code of Regulations Concerning Additional Assignment Authorizations for Specialist Teaching Credentials in Learning and Severely Handicapped The designated time for the public hearing having arrived Chair Fortune opened the public hearing and asked Terri Fesperman Assistant Consultant Certification Assignment and Waivers Division to review the proposed changes Ms Fesperman said the amendments pertain to additional assignment authorizations for specialist teacher credentials in learning and severely handicapped She noted that in January the Commission approved regulations to align pre Ryan special education credentials with the current Ryan Education Specialist Credential and the authorization for the low incidence disability areas for the Ryan Specialist Teaching Credential through the use of an assignment option Not included was the Ryan Specialist Teaching Credential in Learning and Severely Handicapped There has been confusion in the field since the creation of the Early Childhood Special Education Specialist Credential as to whether an individual with a Ryan Specialist Teaching Credential in Learning and Severely Handicapped could serve students birth to pre K The amendment offered for the regulations would allow districts to assign individuals to teach ages birth through pre school if they have experience that meets the requirement and the teacher agrees with the assignment Ms Fesperman noted that there were two responses one in support and one in opposition She said that staff recommends adoption of the amendment Chair Fortune opened the floor to public comment Enid Brinkman Credentials and Retirement Supervisor came forward to read a letter from Marilyn Rankin Assistant Superintendent of the Special Services Division for the Tulare County Office of Education In her letter Dr Rankin said her comments represent the concerns of the SELPA that represents 47 school districts within Tulare County She said the Tulare County Office of Education operates an infant program that serves 509 infants Staffing for the program consists of teachers holding a credential authorizing service for the severely handicapped She requested that any credential authorizing service to severely handicapped students be recognized as complete and sufficient credentialing for service for birth through three years of age She said the proposed amendment would not allow teachers with a Moderate to Severe credential to continue in the Tulare program without completing additional course work for a new Early Childhood Credential Ms Fesperman said that in 1997 the Commission approved regulations to update and change the special education credentials creating the Education Specialist Credential Among the many factors and changes were updating the disability areas that are listed on credentials to match current federal categories As part of this authorization for documents was changed to K 12 and the new early childhood specialty was created specifically to serve birth to pre school age The changes sought by Tulare County Office of Education are not something that could be changed within the regulations in front of the Commission She said people who already hold a severe to moderate credential may obtain the early childhood certificate with only 12 16 additional units Ex Officio Representative Waite asked if the current wording means that holders of LH credentials are not allowed to teach birth to age three Ms Fesperman said that is now true When the early childhood certificate was created in the late 80s or early 90s that became the requirement for teaching birth to age three Ex Officio Representative Waite said it seems to shrink the pool of available teachers unnecessarily to require them to have three years of experience since the wording of the credential doesn t specifically preclude teaching ages birth to three Ms Fesperman said the goal is not to disenfranchise those who are already serving the infant population but to reinforce that those without three years experience should obtain an early childhood special education certificate A motion to accept the amendments to the regulations was moved Johnson seconded Madkins and carried without dissent GS 10 B PROPOSED OPTIONS TO ALIGN SUPPLEMENTARY AUTHORIZATIONS TO NO CHILD LEFT BEHIND Dale Janssen Director Certification Assignment and Waivers Division presented this item which addresses aligning supplementary authorizations with NCLB and the state plan Supplementary authorizations are added to existing credentials and are traditionally used in middle school or for specific courses in high school settings Under the proposed State Board regulations however individuals teaching on supplementary authorizations are not NCLB compliant unless they earned their authorization through completing a major Currently credential holders may have a credential authorization in one subject and a supplementary authorization in another The supplementary authorization requires the completion of 20 semester or 10 upper division semester units and enables the holder to teach in middle school and in some high school courses This authorization however does not meet the requirements for a major and is not equivalent to a major in terms of units Mr Janssen said staff is proposing a new authorization called the degree authorization which would be NCLB compliant He presented three options Option 1 creates the Degree Authorization and sets the number of units at 32 semester units or 16 upper division units This in essence would be a second major Option 2 sets the requirement at 45 semester units a more traditional approach that includes enough units for core subjects and elective course work Option 3 is to make no changes recognizing that supplementary authorizations would not be compliant with NCLB and the state plan Chair Fortune invited public comment Those speaking were Bruce Kitchen School District HR and Personnel Administrators for San Bernardino and San Diego Counties said that 15 years ago the core curriculum concept was established in middle schools allowing a combination of language arts and social science or math and science Teachers could teach with a multiple subject credential The proposed requirements for a major could mean that hundreds of teachers will have to return to school to obtain the appropriate units to continue to teach in middle school It also could well destroy the core curriculum concept So it is important to do some serious thinking about how this will impact middle schools Patricia Rucker California Teacher s Association said she is concerned about the impact on teachers currently working and being assigned based on supplementary authorizations Will they be required to do additional degree requirements when their credential is up for reauthorization The options don t really address the decisions that districts make with regard to teacher assignments The problem is the reality of how teachers are assigned and the multiple ways that districts use those authorizations in core subjects and non core subjects This may limit the assignments for teachers already in positions Dr Shelley Kriegler University of California Los Angeles Department of Math drew attention to a letter in the Commission materials that supports 32 semester units rather than 45 units She said based on her discussions with other universities 32 is a reasonable number of units to meet major requirements It is similar to the requirement that many universities make for those who complete double majors She said she also has some concerns One is the unintended consequence if the requirement is not reasonable and access is not available to middle school teachers If the requirements have wiggle room then 6th and 7th grade teachers will be able to teach with multiple subject credentials If requirements are set too high teachers who are trying to earn supplemental authorizations will fall back on multiple subject credentials This could have the unintended consequence of actually producing teachers with less math background for example than teachers who earned supplemental authorizations This may be an opportunity to look at standards in middle school and encourage IHEs to develop programs to target teaching at the middle school level The Commission should do what it can to encourage people to work toward the new degree authorization rather than falling back on multiple subject credentials Commissioner Lilly said that NCLB is not creating a problem with middle schools in California but merely exacerbating it He said the state has never valued middle school teaching enough to look at it separately and see what a teacher needs to be well qualified at that level He asked Mr Janssen what the impact of Option 1 and 2 will be on teachers who currently hold supplemental authorizations Mr Janssen said that is a question for the State Board rather than for the Commission Individuals with credentials prior to July 1 2002 can use the HOUSSE method to demonstrate subject matter competence There will however be a pool of individuals who since that time have received their credentials but who are not NCLB compliant Vice Chair Madkins asked how big that pool of individuals is Mr Janssen said about 3 300 multiple subject and 1 700 to 2 000 single subject supplemental authorizations have been issued Not all of those people may be using their supplemental authorizations in their current jobs A motion to adopt Option 1 creating the Degree Authorization and setting the requirement at 32 semester units was made Madkins seconded Lilly and carried without dissent GS 10 C CONFORMING PRE INTERN PROGRAMS TO NCLB REQUIREMENTS Beth Graybill interim Director Professional Services Division presented this item Ms Graybill noted that the pre intern program was established in 1997 as a short term solution for meeting the demand for more teachers A variety of factors including class size reduction student population growth and retirements were driving increases in emergency permits Unfortunately without support these teachers either didn t stick around or only made haphazard progress on completing credentials The pre intern program was part of the effort to close the door on ongoing emergency permits It provides a systematic approach to helping individuals obtain subject matter proficiency moving them into credential programs more quickly The program saw strong growth through 2002 but demand began to decline in the past year and is expected to decline in the coming year due to improvement in teacher retention and recruitment strategies Many districts in anticipation of NCLB requirements are not hiring as many pre interns as they did previously Nonetheless Ms Graybill said districts continue to face shortages especially in isolated geographical areas hard to staff schools and specific subject areas Maintaining a pre intern program at some level allows districts to adapt to change and move toward the goal of having all highly qualified teachers Phasing out the program allows districts time The options identified for consideration are Option 1 reduces the number of pre interns as demand declines Option 2 establishes a cap on pre interns and discontinues the program effective July 1 2006 Option 3 calls for no change maintaining the original program structure and continuing it as long as there are funds to do so Chair Fortune asked for public comment Those speaking were David Simmons Ventura County Superintendent of Schools Pre intern Coordinator said his program includes 150 pre interns a year He praised what the pre intern program has been able to accomplish and added that veteran teaches are now using the pre intern program to meet the requirements of NCLB especially those who hold supplemental credentials He said the credentialed teachers who have waivers are going through a preparation course for CSET He also said the ASAP program has been extremely beneficial helping candidates move quickly through their subject matter competence requirement Jeff Hamlin Ventura County Superintendent of Schools Teacher Support Program Coordinator said the pre intern program in the coastal region from Ventura to the Bay Area has been highly successful He said the program is serving a wonderful purpose and that he can attest to the reduction in emergency permits that has been associated with the pre intern program He said the advisement that comes with program really helps pre interns and that the support of mentor teachers increases the possibility of their success and therefore their retention in the classroom He said the pre intern program is a wonderful beginning step for alternative certification Commissioner Lilly asked if Option 3 were adopted with a program elimination date of July 1 2006 would participants be able to move to intern status or would they simply not have options once the program was terminated Ms Graybill said they would have nowhere to go unless the options were modified to include allowing current participants to complete the program But since they would not be NCLB compliant the district would be endangering its federal funding Vice Chair Madkins noted that he agreed with the speakers that the program has provided a valuable source of teachers He asked if it would be helpful to make the elimination date 2005 to signal to people that they should not enter the program if they cannot finish it by the NCLB 2006 date Executive Director Swofford said the option could be worded to allow completion of the program in the 2005 06 school year Ms Graybill agreed that such a move would send a signal that pre interns should work toward program completion A motion to adopt Option 2 capping the number of participants and eliminating new entries into the program effective July 1 2005 was made Lilly and seconded Whirry Commissioner Lilly said he is assuming in adopting that option that it would be possible to continue the ASAP program for candidates who are not teachers of record As such it could continue as a feeder program for intern programs Ms Graybill said ASAP could continue indefinitely as long as there is funding The motion was approved with no dissent GS 10 D PROPOSED OPTIONS TO ALIGN EMERGENCY PERMITS AND CREDENTIAL WAIVERS WITH NO CHILD LEFT BEHIND Mr Janssen said that the State Board regulations specifically state that teachers on emergency permits and waivers are not highly qualified and not NCLB compliant As a side note Mr Janssen said staff s recommendation does not include special education emergency permits and waivers because the Special Education Act is currently being reauthorized by Congress and new definitions are expected to be included when the act is passed For emergency permits staff offered the following options Option 1 is to end issuance as of September 1 2003 Option 2 is to no longer issue emergency permits in core subject areas after Sept 1 2003 in Title 1 classrooms and after Sept 1 2005 in all classrooms The Commission would continue to issue emergency permits in non core subjects Option 3 is to continue to issue emergency permits but change the emphasis to subject matter competency rather than enrollment in a credential program Under this option the Commission could increase the unit requirements making it more likely that participants could pass the subject matter competency test and move into an intern program The permit would be a one year document giving the individual time to pass the exam with no reissuance This option does not comply with NCLB Option 4 is to not change anything This also is not NCLB compliant Chair Fortune invited public comment Speakers were Sharon Robison Association of California School Administrators said her organization believes there will always be an immediate need for emergency permits and waivers particularly in hard to staff areas and subjects It is not a good option to send students home because a district cannot find a qualified teacher She said it is up to the district not the Commission to take responsibility and bear the consequences for not having NCLB compliant teachers Stephanie Farland California School Boards Association echoed Ms Robison s comments She said all districts want to staff schools with NCLB compliant teachers but that it isn t always going to be possible It is important to continue to have emergency permits and waivers because the alternative is long term substitute teachers who aren t required to have any units other than a degree and to pass CBEST She said Options 1 and 2 are not realistic because core classes are the hardest ones to fill Option 3 is one possibility but Option 4 no change is best for the districts Joy Carter Orange County Department of Education said she supported what Ms Robison said Patricia Rucker California Teacher s Association said some 44 000 teachers are currently on emergency permits and that many are in hard to staff low performing high priority schools These schools will be a problem even if emergency permits and waivers are eliminated People who are substitute teachers are not NCLB compliant All of the decisions the Commission is making today will only continue to make these schools hard to staff None of them will increase the opportunity for these schools to show improvement in student achievement and they will not increase public confidence in these schools These decisions will however decrease the morale of teachers who are working on credential requirements The decisions that the Commission makes ultimately will impact the wrong schools the schools that are most in need of highly qualified teachers Commissioner Lilly said he fully understands the staffing difficulty that some schools face But in good conscience he said he cannot vote for an option that says the state is willing to have unqualified teachers in front of these kids He said it is a momentous occasion if the Commission can finally say there will be an end to emergency permits in this state He said he is a fan of the second option because it allows the Commission to eliminate emergency permits in a way that puts pressure on districts but allows the change to be phased in He said he agrees with the last speaker but the answer is not to continue to condone emergency permits The answer is in how to move people toward intern programs If the Commission does nothing not only will it be out of compliance with NCLB but also and far worse it will be continuing to condone having the least qualified teachers in schools that need the most qualified teachers Vice Chair Madkins said he too wishes there would never be an emergency permit teacher in any school But he believes it is important for the Commission to retain the authority to provide an avenue of relief when it is needed He supports Option 2 with the possibility of increasing subject matter emphasis at the same time to transition people into intern programs Commissioner Johnson said eliminating emergency permits is the silver lining in the NCLB cloud She said the state has tried by various means to make it impossible for individuals to work in schools who do not have adequate subject matter preparation but that goal has not been achieved She said she too supports Option 2 She said that there is a whole range of reasons why schools are hard to staff She also suggested that shutting down the avenue of emergency permits may mean that more credential holders who apply for a job will be hired She also emphasized that teaching is not a right but an earned privilege Those who can t or won t meet the qualifications should find other careers Commissioner Beckner said that being out in the field she understands the complications but that it is important that the Commission take this step so that the state has individuals working with children who are the most suitable Option 2 takes stand that emergency permits will be phased out and it says a lot about what the Commission stands for A motion to adopt Option 2 phasing out emergency permits in core subjects in Title 1 classrooms after Sept 1 2003 and in all classrooms after July 1 2005 was made Lilly seconded Whirry and approved without dissent Turning to waivers Mr Janssen explained that they also are not NCLB compliant The options for consideration are Option 1 is the same as Option 2 for emergency permits stopping waivers in core subjects in Title 1 classrooms after Sept 1 2003 and in all other classrooms after July 1 2005 Option 2 is to eliminate waivers altogether after July 1 2006 This option is not compliant for the intervening years before elimination Option 3 continues the practice of issuing waivers but changes the criteria The option is not compliant Option 4 is to take no action also not compliant Chair Fortune invited speakers who spoke on previous items to return to address this one All declined expect one Patricia Rucker California Teacher s Association said any of the options that are not NCLB compliant will create problems for districts Having said that she said it would maximize flexibility to give teaches time to cure whatever their missing requirements are She encouraged the Commission to look for ways to help districts Commissioner Johnson said she believes the Commission needs to retain the waiver option because there will always be some teacher who breaks a leg and a district will need to find a replacement As long as a person on a waiver is not in a Title 1 setting it is not a problem currently She said the Commission needs to keep the option Vice Chair Madkins asked if despite adopting Option 1 the Commission would still retain authority to issue a waiver even if it chose not to exercise it Mr Janssen agreed that the Commission would still have the authority to issue waivers because nothing is changing the Education Code provision giving the Commission that power Vice Chair Madkins said that means the Commission would still have the ability to address emergencies A motion to approve Option 1 no longer issuing waivers in core subjects in Title 1 classrooms after Sept 1 2003 and in all other classrooms after July 1 2005 was made Madkins seconded Whirry and approved without dissent Chair Fortune invited the State Board s Karen Steentofte to come forward again and comment on whether the Commission s actions would allow the State Board to move forward Ms Steentofte said yes and thanked the Commission for working so expeditiously LEGISLATIVE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE Executive Director Swofford announced that since Commissioner Beckner had to leave the Commission was re establishing its quorum under the provisions of Education Code Section 44412 Commissioner Vaca filling in for Commissioner Beckner convened the Legislative Committee of the Whole Anne Padilla Consultant Office of Governmental Relations said that the Legislature is currently on summer recess but will return on August 18 for four weeks and then recess on Sept 12 As a result of the summer break there are no items under Leg 2 Analyses of Bills of Interest to the Commission LEG 1 Status of Legislation of Interest to the Commission Ms Padilla said that as the Commission requested funding has been added to the state budget for AB 54 Oropeza The bill requires the Commission to study cultural competency training for teachers and submit a report by May 1 2005 The staff recommendation is to move from a seeks amendment to a approve position A motion to do so was made Johnson seconded Madkins and carried without dissent Chair Fortune recessed the Legislative Committee of the Whole to welcome State Superintendent of Public Instruction Jack O Connell He presented Designee Marilyn Whirry with a certificate of recognition for her outstanding work on the Commission and thanked her for all of her diligent work Returning to the Legislative Committee of the Whole Ms Padilla said that three bills AB 642 AB 907 and SB 5 would require the State Department of Education to create review or in some way reconsider academic content standards Since whenever the Department makes changes in the standards the Commission needs to realign its standards the Commission had sought amendments that would allow it to perform the realignment in its normal timeframe of addressing changes in standards All of the authors were amenable Legislative Counsel advised that no amendment was necessary since the bills are silent with regard to the Commission The staff recommendation is to move from seeks amendments to a watch position A motion to do so was made Madkins seconded Johnson and carried without dissent FISCAL PLANNING AND POLICY COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE Commissioner Vaca filling in for Commissioner Boquiren convened the Fiscal Planning and Policy Committee of the Whole FPPC 1 Update on the Proposed Governor s Budget for Fiscal Year 2003 04 Leyne Milstein Director Information Technology and Support Management Division reported that the Commission received a total of 66 808 million in the current year budget signed by the Governor on August 2 2003 This includes 16 865 million in the Teacher Credentials Fund and 9 744 in the Test Development Administration Account Local Assistance totals 39 814 million and Transition to Teach 385 000 She noted that tied to the budget is a requirement for a reduction of 16 000 positions in state agencies for a savings of 1 066 billion The Commission has been directed to provide a reduction plan of 12 percent for its operating budget or 1 4 million That was submitted to the Department of Finance on August 11 and staff is waiting for feedback Ms Milstein said the agenda materials for FPPC 1 focus on how the reductions and the prior hiring freeze have impacted the Commission s divisions and ability to offer services The result is most evident in the Certification Assignments and Waivers Division On June 30 2002 25 000 applications were waiting to be processed as of June 30 2003 there were 51 000 The cutbacks have impacted the Commission s ability to process applications The division has identified priorities for the current fiscal year 1 evaluate credential applications 2 training 3 phone calls and 4 e mails The result will be changes in service levels and responsiveness to people who request service or information Time on the phone and in the office for meetings will be reduced so the division can focus on credential processing Similarly the Professional Practices Division has lost staff and implemented processes to deal with increased workload and decreased resources Effective the following Monday telephone hours will be reduced to noon to 5 p m The Professional Services Division is using information technology to become more efficient and to cutback on travel to provide training Instead people are being asked to come to Sacramento for training Commissioner Johnson noted that the first sentence on page 5 below the table is missing the word work after to complete the FPPC 2 Status of the Commission s Fiscal Structure Ms Milstein reported that the Teacher Credentials Fund relies on credential fees which are supposed to cover the Commission s main operating expenses staff equipment operating expenses The Test Development Administration Fund on the other hand was established to support test development and administration In the past the credentials fee has been reduced from 70 to the current 55 because of excess revenue due to the high number of credential renewals and emergency permit waiver fees At this point however the revenues are not keeping up with the expenditures Some of this is due to funding the Teacher Services Improvement Project from the Teacher Credentials Fund rather than from the State General Fund and some is due to the reduction in fees As emergency permits and waivers disappear as a source of revenue the situation will only worsen The Commission has made several cost cutting moves including moving to 10 meetings per year rather than 11 and implementing information technology efficiencies However the revenue base is still insufficient to cover operational costs Ms Milstein outlined several options including in the short term getting a loan from the TDA to cover the revenue shortfall and in the long term pursuing an increase in the credential fee Another option seeking a budget augmentation is not realistic in light of the State s budget situation A fourth option reducing operating costs is already being addressed No action was taken FPPC 3 Proposed Budget Change Proposals for Fiscal Year 2004 05 Crista Hill Manager Fiscal and Business Services said the Commission is seeking two budget change proposals funding for the fifth year of the Teacher Services Improvement Project and reallocating unused funds in the Teachers to Troops fund A motion to approve the budget change proposals was made Fortune seconded Madkins and carried without dissent CREDENTIALING CERTIFICATED ASSIGNMENTS COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE Commissioner Hauk convened the Credentialing Certificated Assignments Committee of the Whole C CA 1 Proposal to Delete Sections 80032 2 80058 2 80466 and 80523 3 of Title 5 of the California Code of Regulations Mr Janssen presented the second in a series of three proposals for cleaning up obsolete sections of the regulations In June the Commission deleted 50 sections that did not require public hearing because there was no administrative effect The second set of proposed deletions will require a hearing The staff recommendation is that the Commission approve the deletions and begin the process for setting a public hearing A motion to accept staff s recommendation was made Lilly seconded Vaca and carried without dissent PERFORMANCE STANDARDS COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE Commissioner Lilly convened the Performance Standards Committee of the Whole PERF 1 Research Plan for the Consolidation of Examinations Required of California Teachers Ms Jackson presented a research plan for the consolidation of examinations that teachers are required to take State law requires teacher preparation and assessment to be fully aligned but it also requires that assessment be streamlined The proposed plan includes consulting with stakeholders and experts researching the education code studying current tests and the linkage between them assessing current testing technology and evaluating federal requirements A cost analysis and assessment of impact on the education community and teacher candidates would be included Commissioner Johnson said she is concerned about the Commission s ability to perform such a study given the increased workload and declining resources She asked if there is funding and capacity to accomplish the work Ms Jackson said in the short term the study would require more work but in the long run changes may result in less work The project is not outside the Commission s normal purview Commissioner Johnson also asked if writing samples would be eliminated a move she would not favor Ms Jackson said both CBEST and CSET have constructed responses Changes would be proposed only after carefully looking at what each test measures and the technology that is used to measure each thing There is no intent to change what is measured Ex Officio Representative Wilson said many people favor consolidation but it is important to see that it is done correctly He said it would be an advantage to have an ongoing group of stakeholders work closely with staff throughout the process rather than just gathering input at one or two meetings Executive Director Swofford said one of the focuses of the study will be the national move towards having a portable exam By staying engaged in that discussion the Commission will have an opportunity to influence the outcome Ex Officio Representative Gallagher said it will be important to keep in mind the movement toward linking student achievement to subject matter competency as envisioned in the federal reauthorization of the Higher Education Act Ex Officio Representative Waite emphasized that it will be important for staff to work closely with the field which works directly with the students who take the tests Commissioner Lilly said that it should be fairly easy to bring CSET and CBEST together since the knowledge and skills in CBEST are a subset that is totally contained in CSET But RICA is a different kind of examination since it tests pedagogy rather than content Restructuring the other tests so that credential candidates pay one fee and take one exam at one time in one place makes sense but RICA may need to be treated differently Ms Jackson said that is one thing that will be assessed in the study Commissioner Lilly also expressed concern about how any test consolidation would be characterized Ms Jackson said the key is that the study addresses the technical question of how testing could be done better A motion to approve the study plan was made Madkins and seconded Whirry Commissioners Lilly and Johnson said that it is important to assure full involvement of stakeholders Executive Director Swofford said he plans a design team approach with extensive fact finding that will be shared with the field and provided in an update to the Commission The motion was approved without dissent PREPARATION STANDARDS COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE Commissioner Johnson convened the Preparation Standards Committee of the Whole PREP 1 Approval of Professional Teacher Induction Programs Karen Sacramento and Cheryl Hickey both consultants with the Professional Services Division

the total approved to date to 62 with 701 participating districts and over 10 000 participating new teachers Commissioner Johnson noted that at the bottom of page 7 of the agenda material the figure

Kjelland a BTSA Interagency Task Force member presented the 85 953 million budget allocation for BTSA The expenditure plan has a slight decrease in the number of new teachers expected and also includes funding for program review There is a slight reduction from 17 down to 12 for consultants The budget envisions funding for all eligible teachers Staff recommends approval of the spending plan A motion to approve the spending plan was made Whirry seconded Hauk and carried without dissent PREP 3 Request for Initial Institutional Accreditation for Three Prospective Program Sponsors Larry Birch Administrator Professional Services Division said there are two stages in the process for an institution to establish a teacher preparation program The first stage is establishing eligibility to submit programs for review Staff has reviewed proposals from three prospective program sponsors Western Governors University High Tech High and California College of Arts and Crafts and recommends first stage approval A motion to grant initial institutional accreditation to the three prospective program sponsors was made Madkins seconded Hauk and carried without dissent PREP 4 Approval of Subject Matter Preparation Programs Submitted by Colleges and Universities Mike McKibbin and Helen Hawley consultants for the Professional Services Division presented programs for approval including a single subject program in art at California College of Arts and Crafts and multiple subject programs at Azusa Pacific University Concordia University and University of San Diego A motion to approve the programs was made Hauk seconded Madkins and carried without dissent PREP 5 Proposed Standards and Guidelines for Professional Clear Administrative Services Credential Programs Jim Alford Consultant Professional Services Division reminded the Commission that in June they considered a concept paper to implement standards and guidelines for the Professional Clear Administrative Services Credential The program options are intended to restructure the credential process to focus on mentoring and assistance The agenda material recaps five options that an administrative candidate can use These include attending a traditional Tier 2 program demonstrating mastery of fieldwork in a Commission approved program completing AB 75 Principal Training completion of an alternative program created by a local education agency university or other entity that meets Commission requirements and passage of a national test The last option may not become operational for some time because there is no test being administered yet Mr Alford said that two of the options require standards and guidelines Staff is proposing some revision of current standards for traditional tier two programs and the proposed revisions are in the agenda Staff is requesting direction to post the revisions online for field review and comment Final proposed standards would be brought back to the Commission perhaps as early as October New guidelines are required to implement the alternative program option The agenda includes draft guidelines Staff is requesting direction also to post the new guidelines online for field review and comment As with the revised standards final proposed guidelines will be brought back to the Commission perhaps as early as October Commissioner Johnson invited public comment Sharon Robison ACSA said her organization is very supportive of the alternative program option and is getting calls daily asking when the option will be available She asked for action as quickly as possible In addition she asked the Commission to consider clarifying the expectation of the timeline It may not be possible for candidates to enter a program as soon as they obtain a position so a 90 to 120 day time lag would provide a good window of opportunity A completion date that allows an extension of the two year time period to up to three years also is favored Secondly Ms Robison said that there is some confusion about the word standards The concept in the CPSELs is that standards refer to defined content skills and knowledge that an administrator should know and be able to do The standards now under consideration refer to delivery standards Ms Robison suggested that they be called something other than standards to avoid confusion and clarify that everyone is being held to the same standards Ms Robison also encouraged the Commission to continue to pursue a national assessment that could be used for the examination option since there is a great deal of interest in the option In closing she thanked the Commission for its continuing pursuit of restructuring the administrative services credential Commissioner Johnson thanked Ms Robison for her continued support Commissioner Johnson indicated that there is Commission consensus that staff be directed to post the proposals and solicit e mail responses from the field RETURN TO GENERAL SESSION The Commission returned to General Session Chair Fortune noted that there was an item that she forgot to include during her report Executive Director Swofford has been elected president of the
