advice always listen to your mother Laughter Mine used to say never swallow your pretzel until you ve chewed it Laughter I guess I wasn t listening But it s great to be back here in the great state of Missouri and Springfield Applause I want to thank the Chamber of Commerce for hosting this event It gives me a chance to share some of my thoughts with our fellow citizens as I work my way down the heartland of America I started earlier in Moline Illinois at a factory that makes John Deere tractors I am here to talk to farmers I m on my way down to New Orleans to remind people that much of what we grow and produce in America is shipped overseas out of that port I m really here to remind people of the great values of our country lived in your everyday lives So I want to thank you all for coming I m grateful for a fine United States Senator and a good friend of mine Kit Bond for being here Thank you for coming Kit Applause I appreciate my Secretary of Commerce as well as the Secretary

the next stop I want to thank so very much Roseann Blunt for being here the wife of your Congressman Applause The First Lady of your fine state met me at the airport and I want to thank Lori Holden for coming out to say hello Applause But most of all I want to thank you all for taking time out of your day to be here to greet me It s been an unbelievable experience to be your President Thank you Applause I m so proud to come and be able to share some thoughts about how to make sure America remains strong and to make sure people who are trying to find work are able to do so You know my view about this is that the role of government is not to try to create wealth The role of government is to create an environment in which people are willing to take risks in which the entrepreneur is willing to expand through capital investment The job of government is to create an environment in which people are willing to create jobs so people who want work or can find work And that starts with making sure our nation is safe In order to make sure in order to make sure that there s confidence in our economy and that the environment is good for job creation My biggest job is to prevent the enemy from hitting us again and that s exactly what I m going to do Applause We take homeland security very seriously in America now I put a good man in place Tom Ridge to make sure that any time we get any hint that anybody would try to harm America again we ll act and we ll act strong And if we get any scintilla of evidence that somebody may try to harm America we will bring them to justice Applause I want to thank the law enforcement officers and officials who are on alert And we ve got to remain on alert You see something unusual happening in your community contact the local law enforcement We re on the look But the truth of the matter is the best way to protect America is find the enemy where they hide and get em Applause I am so proud I am so proud of those who wear our uniform Applause We have given them a big task and they re performing brilliantly For those of you who may have a son or a daughter in our military I want to thank you from the bottom of my heart For those of you who have a husband or wife in the military or a mom or a dad I want to thank you from the bottom of my heart Our military is doing us proud Applause We have sent them on a difficult mission It is getting more difficult as time progresses After all we ve got our troops now looking in caves looking in villages scouring the countryside When I first announced our mission I told the American people it may take a while that we must show discipline and resolve and we must be steadfast in our purpose And that s exactly what the American people that s how the American people are reacting and for that I m grateful And so are our troops We had objectives that our troops have accomplished One we said if you harbor a terrorist if you hide a terrorist if you feed a terrorist you re just as guilty as the terrorist and the Taliban is paying a price Applause I hope you re as proud as I am of the pictures of joy as our troops have liberated the women of Afghanistan the Taliban Applause We re not only fighting for freedom we re liberating people from the clutches of oppression And now we re after al Qaeda They think they can run they think they can hide from the mighty United States But we re patient we re strong we re resolved We re going to stay on the hunt until we bring them to justice Applause In order to make sure people can find work we better make sure everybody in America is educated I had an honor I had the high honor of traveling our country last week with authors of a good education bill It s one by the way that says every child can learn every child can learn We must teach children the basics and in return for help you must show us just like you say here in Missouri whether or not children can read and write and add and subtract And if they cannot let s correct problems early before it s too late It also says inherent in that bill the people who care more about the children in this part of the world are the moms and dads and teachers who live in this part of the world We believe in local control of schools Applause I stood up in front of the American people there on this trip and I said you all may not believe this certainly the people in the Crawford Texas coffee shop may not believe it when I say it but Ted Kennedy did a fine job on this bill Laughter I never thought I would hear myself say that Laughter Of course he never thought I would say it Laughter But I meant it I meant it It goes to show what can happen when Republicans and Democrats set aside their political differences and focus on what s right for America Let me tell you what we need in Washington Applause We need people to put party aside and say America is the most important thing in Washington D C Applause In order to make sure people can find work this nation better better knock down trade barriers See one of the things we re good at really good at is growing food We re the best in the world And it makes sense that if we re good at growing food that we ought to be trying to sell it not only at home but when we have a little extra overseas If you want to be if you re good at something and the best at something it makes sense to allow that product to be overseas One of the things I m fighting for and one of the things I think makes great sense is for this nation to be a free trade nation not to be afraid to compete but let us compete And when we can compete in a fair way we can whip anybody when it comes to selling food Applause The other thing we need to do is to make sure we have an energy policy We re a blessed nation because we can grow our own food and therefore we re secure A nation that can feed its people is a nation more secure Now if you re secure when you feed the nation it seems like one of the things we ought to try to be more secure about as well is having an energy policy that makes us less reliant on foreign sources of energy Applause We can do a better job of conservation and we will We can do a better job of distribution and we must We can use some innovative products to provide energy like ethanol But one of the things we ve got to do is to explore for energy in our own lands in an environmentally sensitive way Applause We had a trade bill bottled up in the Senate I hope they move it when we get back We ve got an energy bill bottled up in the Senate I hope they move it when we get back It is in the nation s interests that we move those two bills And finally in order to make sure people can find work and I m worried about the fact that the evil ones hit us and it caused people to lose their job in order to make sure they can find work we ve got to have good solid economic policy coming out of Washington D C And that starts with understanding how jobs are created One way you can create jobs is to lower people s taxes Applause If people have more money to spend it means somebody has got to produce more for them And the producers then need to hire people It s economics 101 Except sometimes people in Washington haven t taken the course Laughter We passed a meaningful tax cut And now some of them want to take it away from you by delaying it AUDIENCE Booo THE PRESIDENT Yes I agree The best way the worst thing to do is in the face of this recession is to not let people have their tax break It doesn t make any economic sense And that s why we re not going to let them that s why we re not going to let them repeal this tax cut Applause And not only that we can help workers who got laid off We need to extend the unemployment benefits And we need to help them with their health care And we can do that if we make our mind up to put people s lives ahead of partisan politics But I m going to remind the folks in Washington that what people don t want is an unemployment check What they want is a permanent paycheck Applause And therefore we ve got to put plans in place to stimulate our economy that creates jobs that says to employers if you buy equipment you get a little extra in order to help people find work No we can do a better job in Washington D C of addressing this economic downturn And I m confident when the people s voice rises up the good folks up there elected to represent you all and everybody else will hear you loud and clear One of the things that the evil ones didn t figure out was how strong we are Applause Oh they knew we had a nice military but they didn t think we d use it They made a bad mistake Applause But what they also don t understand is the character of our nation They don t understand what I know that the great strength of this country really isn t in our airplanes or guns it s not in our stock market those are parts of our country that are strong But the great strength is in the hearts and souls of our fellow citizens Applause This is a nation of a lot of character It s a strong nation because we re strong people It is a nation that is determined and patient But it s also a nation that s compassionate and decent The evil ones hit us and they caused a lot of loss of life and a lot of anguish a lot of fright and a lot of fear But they also caused folks all across our country to search their soul about life They caused moms and dads to ask the fundamental question of what was the most important thing for them The good news is about America moms and dads all across America are now saying my most important job is to love my children with all my heart Applause What the evil ones did is they reminded us that there are things important in life such as loving your neighbor like you d like to be loved yourself People ask me all the time what can they do to help fight terror And one thing you can do is walk across the street and tell a neighbor in need you love them If you find somebody who s shut in just spend a little time If you want to fight evil mentor a child who needs to learn how to read Support your teachers get involved with public education If you want to fight evil make a contribution to a local charity Go to your church or synagogue and mosque and figure out how you can help a community become a better place That s what s happening all across America You know folks we re going to win the war but we re also going to win because the goodness of America will overshadow the evil of those who take innocent life Applause It is such an honor to be moving around the country to be with the good folks who make the country strong I want to thank you so very much for your hospitality I want to thank you for your prayer May God bless America Applause Thank you all Thank you all very much and God bless Thank you Applause END news releases 2002 01 print 20020114 4 html Printer Friendly Version president President vicepresident Vice President firstlady First Lady
