Fast Reaction Experiments Enabling Science Technology Applications and Research FREESTAR STS 107 NASA Student Involvement Program grades 9 12 Shuttle Small Payloads Project has an average of 5 manifested payloads per year Some of the payloads might be a canister of SEM carrier program or 1 2 canisters of GAS carrier program or a canister with Hitchhiker Avionic on a sidewall unit or a cross bay bridge with combination of GAS canisters SEM canisters and Hitchhiker Avionic The outcome of the physical appearance of payloads is determined by how many scientific experiments can be flown together and how much space on the Space Shuttle is available Our current mission page is the place to find out which experiment is flying so please stay tune styles font css bypass bypass navigation

Special GAS The first GAS payload flew June 27 1982 on STS 4 Since then over 150 GAS payloads have flown GAS payloads are carried in standard canisters which can be mounted in varied locations on the side of the Shuttle payload bay NASA intends to emphasize the U S educational aspects of GAS program while continuing to serve the needs of scientific and multidisciplinary communities GAS payloads have been flying for 20 years G 780 and G 774 are manifested on Space Shuttle Discovery note the following link will open the page in a new browser http www ksc nasa gov STS 105 G 780 from Mayo High School in Rochester Minnesota is investigating cell growth in microgravity G 774 a NASA payload from Marshall Space Flight Center MSFC and Glenn Research Center GRC is investigating smoldering

Module SEM sem sem html SEM is an educational program that National Aeronautics and Space Administration NASA developed for kids The program is designed to help kids discover more about space through building experiments that may ultimately fly on a space shuttle SEM is open to United States US students in grades Kindergarten K 12 and on the University level Grades 9 12 may also apply through the NASA Student Involvement Program NASA Student Involvement Program NSIP which is an annual national competition Information on the grades 9 12 note the following link will open the page in a new

Support Assistant The Space Experiment Module SEM program focuses on the science of zero gravity and microgravity Through Space Experiment Module SEM kids learn about putting a scientific experiment into space With the help of a teacher or mentor students create design and build their own experiments Selected student experiments are flown in NASA provided modules The Space Experiment Module SEM carrier system accommodates ten modules in a standard gas gas html Get Away Special canister that is mounted in the cargo bay of the Space Shuttle Experiments are qualified for the program through a flight certification process that includes an experiment proposal review and a Customer Agreement There is no cost for student experiments to fly in the program The SEM program began in 1995 and since then it has flown 9 missions The next SEM experiment going up in space is SEM 10 sem new sem10 html SEM 10 was installed in Space Shuttle Discovery Space Transportation System STS 105 in early May The launch schedule is National Estimated Time NET August 9 2001 There are already four SEM missions scheduled to launch in the near future SEM 11 and 12 will fly on STS 108 SEM 13 on Shuttle Transport
