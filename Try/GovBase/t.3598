2002 Highlights 2003 January 2003 highlight 2003 01 01 highlight 2003 01 01 pdf Studies of Oxide Film Growth A set of related pulsed ion beam surface analysis methods known collectively as time of flight ion scattering and recoil spectroscopy TOF ISARS have been used in conjunction with complementary X ray photolectron spectroscopy to perform in situ studies of oxide film growth and oxide metal interface processes with nanoscale resolution The integrated analytical techniques provide surface compositional and structural information on a time scale that is commensurate with thin film deposition and or surface and interface processes such as oxidation February 2003 highlight 2003 02 01 highlight 2003 02 01 pdf Studies of Polarization Domains in Nanostructured Ferroelectric Thin Films We investigated ferroelectric domain dynamics at the nanoscale through evaluation of domain structure stability and relaxation as a function of ferroelectric layer microstructure and controlled capacitor size and geometry This was achieved by using a piezoresponse imaging method based on the detection of the local electromechanical vibration of polarized domains in a ferroelectric sample caused by an external AC voltage applied between an atomic force microscope tip and an electrode layer underneath the ferroelectric layer March 2003 highlight 2003 03 01 highlight 2003 03 01 pdf Ferroelectricity in Perovskite Superlattices by Atomic Level Simulation There is a long history of using atomic level simulation to explore the microstructure property relationship in metals semiconductors and ceramics Our simulations show that the properties of ferroelectric paraelectric composites are determined by the interplay between the strong electric fields associated with the intrinsic electric dipoles of the ferroelect ric with the induced polarization in the paraelectric The materials specific atomic level potentials for the KNbO3 KTaO3 system and our recently developed potentials for the BaTiO3 SrTiO3 system open up to simulation a large number of problems on the interplay of ferroelectricity and microstructure April 2003 highlight 2003 04 01 highlight 2003 04 01 pdf Domain Structures In Fatigue Free SrBi2Nb2O9 We have succeeded in the first experimental observation of the domain structure in thin films of SrBi2Nb2O9 a ferroelectric material that is fatigue free i e does not show a loss of switched polarization with increasing number of switching cycles Observation of this domain structure furthers our understanding of the contributions of elastic strain dipole dipole interactions and electrostatic field effects to the complex domain structures found in oxide ferroelectrics May 2003 highlight 2003 05 01 highlight 2003 05 01 pdf Organic Conductors as Nanorulers and Templates for Nanofabrication Layered molecular conductors in which cationic organic layers alternate with anionic layers are a widely studied class of materials because of a rich variety of electronic and magnetic properties that they exhibit Reduced dimensionality and electron correlation effects in these materials also make them an ideal reference point for gaining important insights into high Tc superconductivity On the other hand when the cationic and the anionic components are similar in size and structure both these components pack in the same layer which repeats itself giving rise to another type of layered structure June 2003 highlight 2003 06 01 highlight 2003 06 01 pdf Magnetically Coupled Molecular Systems Toward Conducting Magnetic Hybrids A variety of new magnetic materials composed of molecular organic building blocks and spin bearing transition metal ions have been synthesized These solid state materials have novel nanoscale structures that can be readily modified to tailor their magnetic properties The dicyanamide anion N CN 2 has been shown to be a versatile ligand for linking transition metals in two dimensional arrays July 2003 highlight 2003 07 01 highlight 2003 07 01 pdf Layered Molecular Conductors with Organic Counterions Superconductivity with a transition temperature Tc 5 K was found by our group in the all organic electron donor radical salt ET 2SF5CH2CF2SO3 We have explored both the chemistry and the physics of this system in order to a understand the nature of superconductivity esp the role of interlayer coupling interactions b understand the nature of the normal state c study related compounds made by substitutions of the anion in order to explore the boundaries of the superconducting chemical phase space and the electronic properties of the salts on the other side of these boundaries August 2003 highlight 2003 08 01 highlight 2003 08 01 pdf Theory in Materials Chemistry Computational studies based on electronic structure theory are being carried out to provide insight into properties of materials being studied in the molecular materials nanospace architecture and nanostructured thin film programs September 2003 highlight 2003 09 01 highlight 2003 09 01 pdf Laser Ablation From Brittle Solids The mechanisms by which material ablates from brittle solids can lead to removal of far more material than would be expected considering only the total energy deposition The optical thermal and mechanical properties of the material together with the rate and mechanism of energy deposition determine the material response October 2003 highlight 2003 10 01 highlight 2003 10 01 pdf Argonne scientist wins 2003 Nobel Prize for Physics MSD physicist Alexei A Abrikosov has won the 2003 Nobel Prize for Physics along with Anthony Leggett of the University of Illinois Urbana Champaign and Vitaly Ginzburg of the P N Lebedev Physical Institute in Moscow The three shared the prize for their work on superconductivity and superfluidity explaining the nature of matter at extremely low temperatures November 2003 highlight 2003 11 01 highlight 2003 11 01 pdf Molecular Surface Analysis Soft Ionization with Single Photons Single photon ionization has been found to produce soft ionization of most molecules This results in Low fragmentation simpler spectral interpretation Strong molecular ion signal Trace molecule e g DNA adduct identification becomes possible High ionization cross section Soft ionization with single photons is therefore a powerful new analytical tool for trace analysis of small molecular samples December 2003 highlight 2003 12 01 highlight 2003 12 01 pdf Trace Isotopic Analysis There exists an important class of analytical problems that require both sensitivity and discrimination This class is exemplified by the increasingly stringent demands of the electronic industry for unambiguous quantitative identification of trace impurities in semiconductor materials at high lateral resolution Recently particulate analysis the isotopic and elemental analysis of micron sized grains has also began to occupy the analytical community The difficulty in these two cases a rises from the need to make the measurement before consuming the few atoms of the element of interest while discriminating against the vast excess of bulk atoms archive 2002 html http www anl gov ANL
