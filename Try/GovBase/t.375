Nicaragua shortly after the storm and conducting an extensive 14 7 million effort in all Mitch affected countries under an agreement with the USAID Mission in Honduras and the supplemental budget allocation of May 1999 The USGS program involves activities in four major categories Providing basic information in the form of topographic maps aerial photography and satellite imagery Monitoring and assessing risk from floods landslides and debris flows Developing geographic information system GIS products for use by national and local officials in disaster mitigation and urban planning Strengthening the capacity of Central American national agencies and local governments to monitor and assess hazards and develop strategies for risk reduction and disaster response projectsites html

aerial html Aerial and Satellite Imagery USGS has indexed archived and made publicly available approximately 18 000 frames of high resolution aerial photography collected by the U S Air force in December 1998 over the Mitch affected countries USGS has also archived an additional 5000 frames photography acquired through contracts or through sharing arrangements with counterpart agencies in Honduras Guatemala El Salvador and Nicaragua This photography much of which is being made available in digital form is providing an important tool for evaluation of landslide and flood risk around key population centers USGS has made available complete coverage 28 scenes of Central America both before and after Mitch with imagery from the Landsat 4 5 and 7 satellites Additional high resolution 1 meter commercial satellite imagery is also being acquired for selected cities projects watershrimp html Biological Assessments USGS biologists in coordination with specialists from Central American agencies are assessing the health of mangroves in the Gulf of Fonseca an area critical to the Gulf s ecosystem which supports the shrimp and fishing industries of Honduras Nicaragua and El Salvador USGS specialists are also evaluating the damage to coral reefs in the Bay Islands and area which provides significant tourist income to Honduras projects floodhazard html Flood Hazard Mapping Through an agreement with the University of Texas USGS has acquired very high resolution 8 inch vertical resolution maps of flood plains in 15 high priority towns in Honduras Using an airborne laser ranging technique known as LIDAR this project will produce detailed maps for each town depicting projected high water levels under various flood conditions projects gis html GIS Products USGS is working with civil defense Agencies in all four countries to develop geographic information systems for national disaster mitigation and planning Systems are expected to be completed and operational by mid 2000 However USGS has established effective working relationships with these agencies and USGS counterparts OFDA FEMA that will allow expedited responses to disasters in the immediate future USGS is also developing higher resolution GIS s for Tegucigalpa Managua San Salvador Guatemala City and 71 selected cities in the four countries that will allow municipal authorities to develop more effective risk mitigation and disaster response strategies projects hydrologic html Hydrologic Databases Last fall real time hydrologic data from the streamflow gaging station on the Rio Ulua at Chinda Honduras was used by COPECO and ENEE staff to help manage reservoir releases from El Cajon Reservoir during flooding in September 1999 Flow levels at Chinda are monitored to anticipate potential flooding downstream in the Sula Valley where population centers and agricultural areas are at risk Water released from El Cajon Reservoir flows into the Rio Ulua in the intervening reach Heavy rains caused El Cajon Reservoir to fill to near capacity during the flooding Real time data from the stream gage at Chinda were used to help optimize releases from El Cajon both to maximize drawdown of reservoir levels and to minimize flooding downstream in the Sula Valley projects internet html Internet Clearinghouse USGS has installed servers in counterpart agencies in all four countries trained their staff and is now assisting these agencies in gathering and cataloging metadata to be located on the servers These servers will form an integrated network or clearinghouse to facilitate the access to and sharing of data relevant to disaster mitigation and preparedness and the efficient use of natural resources projects landslide html Landslide Hazard Mapping USGS geologists have conducted detailed assessments of and developed risk maps for major landslides in Tegucigalpa Honduras El Berinche El Reparto Campo Sielo USGS has worked with local communities to establish simple monitoring systems and put in place measures to mitigate the risk from future slides Region wide USGS is conducting an extensive program of reconnaissance and field mapping that will produce maps of landslide risk in priority areas in all Mitch affected countries projects streamgage html Stream Gage Networks As of September 2000 22 streamflow monitoring gages have been installed 15 in Honduras 5 in Nicaragua 2 in El Salvador and 2 in Guatemala These gages which transmit data via satellite link to the internet have already provided warnings in Honduras during flooding in 1999 and 2000 that have a averted damage to agricultural equipment b prevented the overtopping of a reservoir and c allowed timely warnings to evacuate at risk population in the Sula Valley The USGS is being designed in close coordination with NOAA which is installing a parallel network of precipitation gages These systems will allow an integrated flood early warning system to be installed in key watersheds A total of between 35 and 40 stream gages are planned by USGS by the end of the program depending on available funding projects topo html Topographic Base Maps USGS has worked with NIMA to make available digital versions of approximately 900 sheets of 1 50 000 scale topographic maps for Honduras Nicaragua El Salvador and Guatemala These maps originally produced by NIMA were reformatted by USGS in a more widely readable data format and are being distributed to USGS and Central American agencies and the public sector These maps will provide a critically needed base for mapping of landslide and flood risk and development of mitigation strategies Training and Capacity Building USGS is working closely with specialists from counterpart agencies and the staff of municipalities in Honduras Nicaragua El Salvador and Guatemala to provide both on the job and formal training in the following areas streamgage installation and maintenance hydrologic data management and analysis landslide risk assessment digital mapping technologies GIS applications data base management and internet data transfer As of September 2000 over 200 specialists from counterpart agencies have received training In addition to these programs USGS is providing direct support in the form of modern computers peripherals software and other equipment needed by counterpart agencies http www doi gov U S Department of the Interior http
