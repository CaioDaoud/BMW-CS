Comet Definitions The following are generally accepted definitions for terms related to cometary astronomy absolute magnitude Ho The brightness of a comet when it is at 1 AU from both the Earth and Sun As this virtually never happens this quantity is calculated from the comet s light curve Unfortunately this quantity is far from absolute It can be different pre and post perihelion It can also change from apparition to apparition for periodic comets anti tail or anomalous tail When a comet s tail appears to be pointing toward the Sun this is called an anti tail or anomalous tail In reality the tail only appears to be pointing toward the Sun To get an anti tail the comet must produce large heavy dust particles If this happens these particles are left along the comet s orbit instead of being pushed away from the Sun and the comet s orbit by light pressure Often dusty comets will produce particules of different sizes creating a fan shaped appearance The smallest dust will be pushed directly away from the Sun like the gas tail and the largest will be left in the comet s orbit When a comet is close to the Sun the angle of this fan can be 90 degrees or larger If the Earth comet Sun geometry is correct the dust in the comet s orbit will appear to point toward the Sun Try this make a right 90 degree angle with your thumb and index finger Your index finger is the main tail and your thumb is the dust left in the comet s orbit Point your finger and thumb directly away from you keeping the angle 90 degrees Your finger seems to be going in exactly the opposite direct from the thumb This is what causes an anti tail apparition The time during which a comet is under observation For periodic comets which have more than one appearance the term apparition is often used with the year of perihelion passage such the 1910 apparition of Comet Halley The term probably is derived from the ghostly appearance of bright naked eye comets astronomical unit AU Standard unit for measuring distance within the solar system One AU is equal to the average distance between the Sun and Earth or about 93 million miles coma or the comet s head The comet s coma or head is the fuzzy haze that surrounds the comet s true nucleus The coma and tail are really all that we see from Earth The shape of the coma can vary from comet to comet and for the same comet during its apparition The shape depends on the comet s distance from the Sun and the relative amount of dust and gas production For faint comets or bright comets producing little dust the coma is usually round Comets which are producing significant quantities of dust have a fan shaped or parabolic comae This is because different size dust is being released The larger dust gets left along the comet s orbital path while smaller dust gets pushed away from the Sun by light pressure The smaller the dust the more directly away from the Sun the dust is pushed With a distribution of both large and small dust sizes a fan is created For comets within 1 AU the coma of a dusty comet often becomes parabolic in shape Clearly for comets with fan shaped or parabolic comae there is no obvious boundary between the coma and tail coma diameter The diameter of the coma is usually given in minutes of arc If the coma is round this is a straightforward definition If the coma is elongated or has a tail the measurement represents the smallest dimension of the coma usually at a right angle to the tail and transecting the brightest part of the coma degree of condensation DC DC is an indicator of how much the surface brightness of the coma increases toward the center of the coma In general DC 0 indicates totally diffuse and DC 9 means stellar As the DC increases the coma size usually decreses and becomes more sharply defined A totally diffuse comet with no brightening toward the center is rated DC 0 With DC 3 5 there is a distinct brightening By DC 7 you have a steep overall gradient and by DC 8 the coma is very small dense and intense with fairly well defined boundaries With DC 9 the comet looks like a soft star or a planet in bad seeing geocentric distance delta The comet s distance from the Earth in astronomical units heliocentric distance r The comet s distance from the Sun in astronomical units long period comets Comets with orbital periods greater than 200 years n The photometric parameter n in the power law formula for comet brightness m1 Ho 5 log delta 2 5n log r indicates how fast the comet s brightness is changing with heliocentric distance r Specifically n is the power in the power law formula That is the comet s brightness varies as r to the n power When the comet s heliocentric brightness m1 5 log delta is plotted against log r the slope of the straight line assuming it is a straight line is 2 5n nucleus The true nucleus of a comet has only been seen once P Halley by spacecraft From the ground the star like nucleus always includes a cloud of dust and gas around the true nucleus Hence terms such as stellar condensation and nuclear condensation are often used when a star like object is seen in the comet s coma The magnitude of the nucleus is denoted m2 and usually isn t of much use because one is really not such what m2 represents In general the value of m2 will get fainter as more magnification is applied observed magnitude m1 The observed magnitude of the comet represents the integrated brightness of the comet s coma or head as seen from Earth This is normally obtained by comparing the comet s average surface brightness with that of defocused stars matching the comet s size of known brightness Because comets have size in contrast to stars which are pinpoints of light a comet of a given brightness will appear less obvious than a star of the same brightness opposition The comet is in the midnight sky on the opposite side of the Earth from the Sun A perfect opposition which almost never happens has the comet 180 degrees away from the Sun outburst in brightness An unexpected increase in brightness over a short period of time due to the release of dust and gas into the coma from the nucleus For a visual observer the nuclear condensation a bright spot near the center of the coma will appear to become star like and brighter in the comet s coma Over time hours days the size of the nuclear condensation will increase as the dust moves away from the nucleus The change in brightness can be as little as half a magnitude and as much as many magnitudes perihelion The point in a comet s orbit that it is closest to the Sun perihelion date The date and time the comet reaches perihelion perihelion distance The comet s distance from the Sun usually expressed in Astronomical Units at perihelion periodic or short period comets Any comet with an orbital period of less than 200 years These comets are indicated by a P before the names For example P Halley is Halley s comet or more properly known as periodic Comet Halley Recently the International Astronomical Union has started numbering periodic comets that have been seen at more than one apparition Thus Halley s Comet is 1P Halley and P de Vico is now known as 122P de Vico position angle PA The PA of a tail or other cometary feature represents the direction on the sky in degrees from north toward which it is pointing Thus a comet in the morning sky in the east that has a tail pointing due west will have a PA of 270 degrees A comet in with a tail poining toward the south east will have a PA of 135 degrees It must be stressed that the determination of the PA of a tail or other feature requires plotting it on an atlas and measuring the angle with a protractor PAs should be measured to at least five degree resolution It is not possible to look in an eyepiece and accurately estimate the PA of a tail Also the determination of PA in the polar regions of the sky is very tricky and may not be intuitive solar conjunction The comet is near the Sun in the sky Usually this means that the comet will not be observable from Earth tail The comet s tail is its most distinctive feature Generally pointing away from the Sun these appendages come in a variety of shapes and lengths The lengths can vary from a small fraction of a degree tails are always measured as the angular length either in degrees or minutes of arc 60 one degree to the rare few that cover a significant fraction of the sky Go
