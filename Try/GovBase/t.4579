The Planetary Rings Node Neil Heather rings jupiter saturn uranus neptune ring planet The Planetary Rings Node is devoted to archiving and distributing scientific data sets relevant to planetary ring systems The two major classes of ring data are images and occultation profiles although a variety of additional data types e g spectra particle absorption signatures etc are also of interest A large fraction of our data sets are from the Voyager missions to the outer planets but Earth based and HST data sets are also represented The Rings Node also performs a variety of services to support research into these data sets These services include developing on line catalogs and information systems filling orders for data developing software tools and coordinating special observing campaigns The Planetary Rings Node supports research into all aspects of planetary ring systems including their physical properties particle sizes composition ring geometry dynamical processes including interactions with satellites and origins Indirectly the Node also supports studies of other dynamical analogs such as the solar nebula and the asteroid belt where similar physical processes are or were at work In addition to supporting research the Rings Node is committed to NASA s broader goal of educating the public about science and technology nodelogo html NODE LOGO http pds jpl nasa gov
