IPTVehicleCompatibilityReport Vehicle Compatibility Recent sales and registrations of light trucks and vans LTVs including sport utility vehicles SUVs have steadily increased as a percentage of the passenger vehicle fleet with LTVs representing 50 percent of new vehicle sales in 2001 and 37 percent of vehicle registrations Consequently this has led to an increased number of fatalities to car occupants who are struck by LTVs This increase in passenger car fatalities has occurred even while the overall fatalities for the U S fleet has stabilized or decreased over the past several years Therefore NHTSA has made vehicle compatibility one of the agency s highest priorities Initiatives the agency plans to pursue in improving vehicle compatibility are included in this report http www nrd
