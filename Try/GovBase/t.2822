Rentschler 510 464 7858 John Goodwin 510 464 7862 OAKLAND Calif Sept 30 2003 The Metropolitan Transportation Commission MTC today received the prestigious Innovation Award from the http www apta com American Public Transportation Association at APTA s Annual Meeting in Salt Lake City The Innovation Award is given annually to a public transportation system or other organization that has designed and implemented programs that demonstrate innovative concepts or effective problem solving techniques not previously applied in the public transportation field APTA honored MTC for the 511 traveler information system launched in the Bay Area in December 2002 The popular toll free service which can be accessed by calling 511 or online at http www 511 org www 511 org provides up to the minute on demand information for transit riders drivers carpoolers and bicyclists throughout the nine county region MTC and a host of public and private partners began developing the 511 system for the Bay Area in 2000 when the Federal Communications Commission granted exclusive use of the 511 phone number to state and local transportation departments to distribute traveler information The Bay Area s 511 phone service now receives more than 53 000 calls each month and earlier in September handled its one millionth call MTC plans a number of enhancements to both the 511 phone and 511 org services in the weeks ahead These will include an all new 511 Transit Web page with the popular TakeTransitSM online transit trip planner a new feature known as 511 Driving Times that uses the latest technology to inform drivers how long it will take to go from point to point on the Bay Area freeway system and a carpooling promotion known as Rideshare Thursdays In addition to the Bay Area 511 systems are now in place or under development in more than a dozen states The Bay Area is the largest metropolitan area in the country and the first in California to activate the 511 service Callers to 511 can get fare and schedule information from nearly three dozen Bay Area transit operators 20 operators of paratransit services for elderly or disabled riders and nine transit agencies outside the region plus the most current reports on road conditions and traffic incidents for the routes they travel and information about carpooling vanpooling and bicycling Whether you use the phone and dial 511 or go online to 511 org the system is designed to be a one stop source of free information that all Bay Area travelers can use every day explains project manager Michael Berman of MTC If you re a driver 511 tells you if there s a delay or road closure and you can decide to go ahead as planned take an alternate route or put off your trip Public transit riders can be connected to transit operators to find out which route to take when the next bus train or ferry is scheduled to run or how much the fare will be The Bay Area rollout of the 511 service is the result of a partnership between MTC the California Department of Transportation Caltrans the California Highway Patrol CHP dozens of the region s transit and paratransit operators and RIDES for Bay Area Commuters Inc which supplies carpooling vanpooling bicycling and other commute option information including information about transportation to airports Designed with a state of the art voice enabled system the 511 phone service is a big upgrade from the Bay Area s previous regional transportation information number The combination of the easy to remember number and the new speech technology make 511 a lot more convenient continued Berman And we will continue to fine tune the service to make it even easier to use MTC is the transportation planning financing and coordinating agency for the nine county San Francisco Bay
