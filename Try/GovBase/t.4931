CONFERENCE This is the Fourteenth Symposium in a well established series of conferences held roughly every three years since 1959 The Symposium is concerned with theoretical experimental and applied aspects of the thermophysical properties of gases liquids and solids The Fourteenth Symposium will feature approximately 140 sessions with more than 600 papers with invited papers on many topics of high interest The areas of thermodynamic and transport properties of fluids and solids are broadly represented Special topics covered in the Fourteenth Symposium are acoustic optical photothermal and subsecond techniques of measuring thermophysical properties materials of strong technological interest namely molten materials natural gas thin films refrigerants polymer solutions and supercritical fluids properties for chemical and metallurgical process design fundamental topics such as molecular simulation of fluid behavior critical behavior properties in low gravity shear effects on property measurement structure of fluids wetting and interfaces and property data including demonstrations of databases The Fourteenth Symposium features the presentation of the Yeram S Touloukian Award of the ASME Heat Transfer Division FINAL PROGRAM The final program of the Symposium will be available at the time of on site registration PROCEEDINGS Papers submitted for publication are due May 1 2000 Instructions for manuscript preparation have been distributed to contributors of abstracts and are available from the Symposium Assistant at NIST All papers will be reviewed The accepted papers will be published in the International Journal of Thermophysics Fluid Phase Equilibria or Journal of Chemical and Engineering Data Organizations and individuals that currently subscribe to these journals will automatically receive the extra volumes Others can make arrangements during the symposium for purchase of the special volumes containing the conference papers PREPRINT VOLUME A preprint volume on CD ROM of the papers submitted for the Symposium by the deadline of May 1 2000 will be distributed to the attendees at the time of registration CONTACTS Technical Information W M Mickey Haynes
