Adobe GoLive 6 Hot Quarks 2004 Overview index html HQ2004 Overview Goals The aim of high energy heavy ion physics is the study of strongly interacting matter at extreme energy densities Quantum Chromo Dynamics QCD predicts that at sufficiently high temperatures and or densities matter should undergo a transition from the standard hadronic phase to a plasma of deconfined quarks and gluons Quark Gluon Plasma QGP a transition which according to our cosmological models took place in the early universe about 10 s after the Big Bang Already the programs at the Brookhaven National Laboratory Alternating Gradient Synchrotron AGS and the CERN Super Proton Synchrotron SPS have produced evidence for the onset of new phenomena The research in this field is now successfully continuing at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider RHIC at BNL while the next phase to take place at the CERN Large Hadron Collider LHC is under preparation There are around 2000 physicists worldwide working in the field a very active and lively expanding community In such a context good communication and networking especially among the young and productive members in the field are vital The aim of the proposed workshop is to enhance the direct exchange of scientific information amongst the younger members of the community both from the experiment and theory Topics that will be addressed include collective phenomena correlations strangeness production photons and dileptons high pt phenomena jets and heavy flavor production Format The workshop should promote and facilitate informal interactions among young scientists in the field It will consist mainly of short 15 20 min presentations each followed by a relatively long Q A session There will be about 12 discussions presentation Q A per day organized in two sessions one in the morning and one in the late afternoon Active participation in the Q A sessions will be encouraged We are considering the possibility of introducing anonymous written questions so as to minimize possible fright barriers to their submission The participants are expected to be present at the workshop premises and to engage in spontaneous discussions beyond the scheduled session time Ample free time between lunch and the afternoon session and after dinner is planned in order to enhance such informal interactions Tutorial Sessions Special tutorial presentations for the most junior physicists will be organised They will precede the sessions where the corresponding subjects are discussed Ample time for Q A will be scheduled Participation The number of participants will be in the range 60 to 80 Participation in the workshop will be by invitation only Every participant will give an oral presentation Proceedings We plan to organize the publication of the complete proceedings of the conference likely in Journal of Physics G Award A symbolic award for the best presentation at the workshop will be instituted It will be dedicated to the memory of the late Klaus Kinder Geiger
