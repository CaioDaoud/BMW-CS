developing an Internet site specifically for employers to replace information currently filed on paper forms The site is called the Employer Reporting System ERS and currently includes three forms pdf ba4 pdf Form BA 4 Report of Compensation Adjustments pdf ba6a pdf Form BA 6a BA 6 Address Report and pdf gl129a pdf Form GL 129a Record of Employer Determination on Employee Protest and one report BA 4 Summary Report Some of your fellow employers were testing the site earlier this year and their comments were very favorable If you choose to file Forms BA 4 and or BA 6a on the Internet we are sure that you also will be favorably impressed Highlights of the site Access to ERS is roles based which means that each user s access is tailored to the role or work they do at their company Access levels are assigned by the company Therefore the employer retains control over what forms their employees can view and submit When you create Form BA 4 for an individual the form is pre filled with the service and compensation data on record at the RRB for that individual and year As you enter an adjustment the screen will calculate and display the new total This should improve the accuracy of the adjustments because you can see the result before you file the form Form BA 4 also includes a Summary Report intended for use in validating your taxes The form accumulates the BA 4 compensation by processing date and creates monthly and yearly totals In 2004 quarterly totals will also be available Form GL 129a is linked to the Internet BA 4 which will be pre filled based on your response to the GL 129a This saves time and improves accuracy If applicable the RRB can send Form BA 6a to an employer as a request for a missing address and the employer can respond on line Instructions This letter
