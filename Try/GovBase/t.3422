manner The President directs The Secretary of Transportation who directs The FAA Administrator who is in charge of the Nine FAA regions which direct FAA local facilities FAA and journalists What does all this mean to a reporter or editor It means your questions about FAA operations will be handled in one of several ways depending on the subject matter For information about the operation of a local facility say an airport traffic control tower in your town call the facility manager who is listed in the blue pages of the phone book under U S Government Dept of Transportation Federal Aviation Administration If he or she can provide one your answer will be given at that point But you may be asked to call the FAA coordinator in your state or Public Affairs in the Regional Headquarters Public Affairs offices SEE FAA REGIONS AND THEIR STATES above for coverage areas Aeronautical Center 405 954 7500 Contact John Clabes or Roland Herwig for Accidents Information for previous five years by

traffic control system Before you call you may want to know what your local facility does or how an airplane is handled by controllers On the next few pages is a primer on how it all works Flight Service Stations We will begin where most flights begin with planning Information on weather en route and at destination cities is available for pilots from FAA Flight Service Stations or Automated Flight Service Stations The difference between these facilities is that Automated Flight Service Stations serve a wide area usually an entire state They replace the older and more numerous Flight Service Stations with state of the art electronic services better processing of pilots calls and more efficient weather and flight planning information From a Flight Service Specialist the pilot learns about weather before his or her flight and can file a flight plan he pilot can also obtain weather information during flight Some air carriers have their own weather services but they the military and general aviation can use these FAA facilities if they wish In general flight plans are not required except for commercial carriers in revenue service We recommend them however as they automatically trigger the search and rescue process if not properly closed out within half an hour of the estimated arrival time Airport Traffic Control Towers What most people think of when they picture air traffic control is people with headsets standing in a glass enclosed room with a view of airplanes taking off and landing This is called an Airport Traffic Control Tower Those people watching the planes through binoculars are directing aircraft on the taxiways and runways of their local airport and aircraft in the air within roughly the visual range of their tower about 5 miles But there can also be controllers in darkened rooms at or near Towers These are Terminal Radar or TRACON Controllers who handle aircraft for several airports in a large metropolitan area generally 30 40 miles from the major airport in the metropolitan area Air Route Traffic Control Centers At Air Route Traffic Control Centers or ARTCCs often called En Route Centers or simply Centers aircraft flying on instrument flight rules IFR between cities are provided with separation services That is controllers are in radio and radar contact with IFR pilots directing the aircraft to keep a safe distance and use the national airspace efficiently THE AIR ROUTE TRAFFIC CONTROL CENTERS in rank order of aircraft handled during 2001 Cleveland Ohio Atlanta Georgia New York New York Chicago Illinois Washington DC Indianapolis Indiana Jacksonville Florida Memphis Tennessee Fort Worth Texas Kansas City Kansas Miami Florida Los Angeles California Minneapolis Minnesota Houston Texas Albuquerque New Mexico Boston Massachusetts Denver Colorado Oakland California Salt Lake City Utah Seattle Washington Anchorage Alaska Instrument flight rules allow pilots who are properly trained and aircraft properly equipped to enter clouds Visual Flight Rules restrict flight to keep clear of clouds so they can always see other aircraft and be seen Because of this IFR flights have the ability to make greater use of the nation s airspace Centers cover large geographical areas so controllers must use remote radio transmitter receivers and remote radars for their work Radar signals and radio transmissions are relayed by microwave or cable Other FAA offices Other FAA offices you may find listed in your phone book are Flight Standards District Office Oversight of commercial air carrier maintenance and training flight procedures general aviation pilot testing aviation safety education accident investigation Civil Aviation Security Field Office Airport and aircraft security hazardous material shipments Airports District Office Funding of public airports Oversight of airport fire fighting and emergency readiness Airway Facilities Sector Sector Field Office Installation and maintenance of FAA radar radio navigation aids and computer equipment Aircraft Certification Office Manufacturing Inspection Office FAA oversight of aircraft design flight test and production foreign and domestic How to get FAA information For information on operation of a local FAA facility Call the facility See blue pages of your local phone book For FAA operation information which involves more than one facility within a state Call the local coordinator For general FAA information accidents FAA policies and plans Call the regional Public Affairs office Preparing for accidents Reporters know that when there s an aviation accident there is no central source for information The more a journalist knows beforehand about which source has what the better The Aviation Space Writers Association has published a booklet on the subject which can be very valuable in guiding reporters and editors through the confusion Air Accidents and the News Media is out of print but if you can find a copy you will be worlds ahead of your colleagues in covering aviation Word in the spring of 99 was that the booklet may be reprinted soon On the following pages is some very general information of the sort found in the AWA booklet which will help a reporter with orientation These are the agencies which can be involved in an air accident and what they do The local agencies The police department or county Sheriff is usually on the scene right away They are responsible for security of the crash site notifying victims next of kin and releasing names of victims to the news media when notification is complete Usually these agencies can only confirm that an accident has taken place not give details The FAA The FAA is required to be notified of aviation accidents Apart from the people on the scene FAA will be among the first to have information about an accident Reports are phoned to the regional headquarters and what is available can be given to reporters right away except for speculation and personal information Since an FAA facility may well be very busy dealing with the accident time may not allow helping reporters It is best to call the Regional Public Affairs Office during duty hours or the Regional Communication Center for this information FAA can give information about circumstances which are initially known about a civil aviation accident This can include origin and planned destination time of the accident available weather type of flight registration number number believed aboard circumstances such as aircraft was on approach for landing at Airport X whether there was air traffic control involvement an FAA weather briefing was given or a flight plan filed National Transportation Safety Board NTSB is responsible for determining probable cause of an accident For major accidents a disaster team is dispatched immediately from Washington DC Other accidents which involve death or substantial damage are investigated by NTSB field offices often conjunction with FAA investigators While FAA can give facts on what is initially known about an accident NTSB is in charge of releasing information about the course of the investigation process Some NTSB offices and the states for which they have responsibility For states not listed call NTSB national public affairs office 202 314 6100 If an accident occurs in Alaska Anchorage office at 907 271 5001 Washington Oregon Idaho Montana call Seattle NTSB 206 870 2200 Colorado Texas Arkansas Louisiana New Mexico Wyoming or Utah call Denver NTSB 303 361 0600 California Nevada Hawaii Arizona call the Los Angeles office at 310 380 5660 Air Carriers Air carriers are responsible for notification of their passengers next of kin In general aviation accidents the local authorities do this job They may be able to provide information on the accident that FAA or the local authorities do not yet have such as type of aircraft involved the flight s itinerary crew complement number of passengers and flight times Airports Accidents at major airports will involve their public affairs office This is another good number to have in your desk file ahead of time Military The Department of Defense is responsible for providing information on accidents involving their aircraft and the military investigates accidents involving their own aircraft The public affairs office for the military installation nearest the accident site handles queries about the matter Direct questions about military aircraft incidents noise complaints etc to the nearest military installation public affairs office no matter what service operates the aircraft Some Search and Rescue Numbers Civil Air Patrol Scott AFB Ill 800 851 3051 or 618 984 2413 Colorado Aeronautical Department Denver 800 593 2772 Idaho Aeronautical Department Boise 208 334
