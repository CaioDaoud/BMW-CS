Overview The New Markets Tax Credit NMTC Program permits taxpayers to receive a credit against Federal income taxes for making qualified equity investments in designated Community Development Entities CDEs Substantially all of the qualified equity investment must in turn be used by the CDE to provide investments in low income communities The credit provided to the investor totals 39 of the cost of the investment and is claimed over a seven year credit allowance period In each of the first three years the investor receives a credit equal to five percent of the total amount paid for the stock or capital interest at the time of purchase For the final four years the value of the credit is six percent annually Investors may not redeem their investments in CDEs prior to the conclusion of the seven year period NMTCs will be allocated annually by the Fund to CDEs under a competitive application process These CDEs will then sell the credits to taxable investors in exchange for stock or a capital interest in the CDEs To qualify as a CDE an entity must be a domestic corporation or partnership that 1 has a mission of serving or providing investment capital for low income communities or low income persons 2 maintains accountability to residents of low income communities through their representation on a governing board of or advisory board to the entity and 3 has been certified as a CDE by the CDFI Fund The Fund is currently accepting applications from entities seeking CDE certification Throughout the life of the NMTC Program the Fund is authorized to allocate to CDEs the authority to issue to their investors up to the aggregate amount of 15 billion in equity as to which NMTCs can be claimed The Fund submitted its second annual NMTC Program Notice of Allocation
