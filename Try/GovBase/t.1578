Search DFG Background West Coast groundfish stocks and harvests have declined significantly since the early 1990s There have been unusually low numbers of young fish for many groundfish species due to natural changes in ocean conditions Fishing pressure has further depressed the adult population In response to this situation the U S Secretary of Commerce declared on January 26 2000 that a commercial fishery failure exists due to this fishery resource disaster The U S Congress responded to this declaration by appropriating funds to provide disaster relief In response to these circumstances the Groundfish Disaster Relief Program was established This program consisted of three relief projects 1 reimbursement for safety equipment 2 enhancement of data collection and 3 the groundfish disaster stipend As of July 15 2003 the safety equipment reimbursement project is complete having distributed approximately 100 000 to groundfish fishermen The Pacific States Marine Fisheries Commission contract provided funds to reimburse vessel owners for the purchase of U S Coast Guard required safety equipment and 800 000 to support an enhanced groundfish data collection program The Employment Development Department EDD contract which has been signed authorizes the expenditure of 1 2 million to provide monthly stipends either 1000 or 1500 to individuals that meet certain eligibility criteria and that qualify for job retraining through a local Workforce Investment Act office Further details on the stipend program are available on the EDD Web site at http www
