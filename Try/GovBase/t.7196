detection and advanced marine law enforcement WHAT TYPES OF JOBS ARE AVAILABLE Although the FLETC has vacancies for Training Instructors there are numerous other vacancies at the FLETC at any given time Some examples include support positions in the Personnel Division Budget and Finance Division Training Analysis and Coordination Division and the many Training Divisions CAN I APPLY FOR A POSITION AT THE FLETC Every vacancy at the FLETC has specific requirements peculiar to that particular position But there are certain criteria which you can examine to find out if you will even be initially considered for the position This information is contained in a section of FLETC s vacancy announcements called the Area of Consideration AOC There are two basic Areas of Consideration with which you need to be familiar Following is each AOC as it would appear in a FLETC vacancy announcement and an explanation A Merit Promotion Career and career conditional employees of the Federal government and reinstatement eligibles This AOC limits the vacancy announcement to current and former employees of the Federal Civil Service A person who is reinstatement eligible is one who has left the government but still maintains his status This AOC does have its exceptions however Those eligible under the Veteran s Readjustment Appointment Program VRA are not required to have status in order to apply for Merit Promotion positions up to and including the GS 11 level Click ExitScript asp GOTO http www usajobs opm gov here to connect to the Office of Personnel Management s web page which explains the VRA program and its requirements and limitations Another exception to the status rule is the Direct Hire Authority to hire veterans with service connected disabilities of 30 or more There are also exceptions for those eligible under the Americans with Disabilities Act ADA Please contact Ms Dubose at 912 261 4162 after reading the rest of this information in order to discuss the FLETC s compliance with the ADA and how it can be of benefit to you All of these exceptions require certain documentation so please read each announcement carefully B All Sources All Sources is defined as anyone meeting the basic eligibility requirements of the announcement regardless of government status It is not limited to those outside of the federal government as some assume it is simply a separate AOC which allows those without status as well as those with status to apply In fact many who apply for a Merit Promotion vacancy also apply for the same vacancy which is advertised All Sources as well but more about that later The point is that if you do not have status and are not eligible to apply under a special program like VRA the 30 Veteran s Program or ADA then you would apply for All Sources vacancy announcements This is a very valid way of applying and allows people a chance to get into the federal government Many people will visit the FLETC s job announcement section and see what appears to be the same position advertised twice On closer inspection however the two main differences become clear first the positions have different announcement numbers second the first position s AOC is Merit Promotion and the second position s AOC is All Sources It is the FLETC s practice to allow selecting officials to choose which AOCs their jobs will have therefore it is common that a manager will opt to have his position open both Merit Promotion and All Sources Because two separate sets of applications are being received the files are kept separately and different announcement numbers must be assigned In most cases these are consecutive with the Merit Promotion announcement listed first e g 98 159 and 98 160 This is not always the case however so be careful and make certain you see an All Sources announcement as well If you are looking for an All Sources announcement and only see Merit Promotion contact the FLETC s Personnel Office and ask if there is an accompanying All Sources announcement for that position APPLICATION FORMS There are three forms which are accepted by the FLETC for application purposes The first is a Standard Form SF 171 The second is the Optional Form OF 612 which is a much shorter form it more closely resembles a private industry application being only front and back And finally a resume is also acceptable Whatever is used must contain the required information in the How to Apply section as well as Attachment One What Your Resume or Application Must Contain which are contained in every FLETC vacancy announcement If you are applying for a Merit Promotion announcement an SF 50 indicating status your most recent performance appraisal and the Job Elements a k a K S A s must be included in your application packet You will find more information about applying for Federal jobs as well as job announcements at the Office of Personnel Management s ExitScript asp GOTO http www usajobs opm gov index htm USAJOBS website THE FORMAT OF FLETC VACANCY ANNOUNCEMENTS FLETC job announcements are divided into several sections Job Information Duties Qualifications and Evaluation Criteria Job Elements and How To Apply A Job Information The first part of FLETC job announcements is the Job Information section This includes information which you need to include on your application resume such as the Vacancy Announcement Number Title Series and Grade The first two are self explanatory The series requires a bit more elaboration however Each position in the federal government is assigned a three or four digit number which indicates the type of job it is For instance the 303 series encompasses general clerk positions whereas 203 is the series for a personnel clerk This also includes information for your reference such as the closing date of the announcement Keep in mind that application packets must be postmarked not received by the closing date of the announcement B Duties Self Explanatory C Qualifications and Evaluation Criteria This section of FLETC vacancy announcements indicates the minimum qualifications against which your application packet will be judged to determine if you meet the basic qualifications of the position D Job Elements Job Elements are also known as K S A s Knowledge Skills and Abilities by some government agencies These are simply elements of the job of which the applicant must have a knowledge or ability The FLETC requires for Merit Promotion positions that these be answered on a separate sheet of paper listing the element and then addressing it It is best to go into great detail as it can not be assumed that because you have held a position of a certain title you have performed certain duties which might be associated with that position The duties and responsibilities must be stated explicitly in your application packet Some people feel that they have addressed the elements already in their resume However the Job Elements must still be covered
