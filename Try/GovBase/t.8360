true color image of the entire Earth to date Using a collection of satellite based observations scientists and visualizers stitched together months of observations of the land surface oceans sea ice and clouds into a seamless true color mosaic of every square kilometer 386 square mile of our planet These images are freely available to educators scientists museums and the public Preview images and links to full resolution versions up to 21 600 pixels across are located below BlueMarble Closeup html Close ups at full 1km per pixel resolution View of the Western Hemisphere Much of the information contained in this image came from a single remote sensing device NASA s cgi bin redirect http modarch gsfc nasa gov Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer or MODIS Flying over 700 km above the Earth onboard the cgi bin redirect http terra nasa gov Terra satellite MODIS provides an integrated tool for observing a variety of terrestrial oceanic and atmospheric features of the Earth The land and coastal ocean portions of these images are based on surface observations collected from June through September 2001 and combined or composited every eight days to compensate for clouds that might block the sensor s view of the surface on any single day Two different types of ocean data were used in these images shallow water true color data and global ocean color or chlorophyll data Topographic shading is based on the GTOPO 30 elevation dataset compiled by the U S Geological Survey s EROS Data Center MODIS observations of polar sea ice were combined with observations of Antarctica made by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration s AVHRR sensor the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer The cloud image is a composite of two days of imagery collected in visible light wavelengths and a third day of thermal infra red imagery over the poles Global city lights derived from 9 months of observations from the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program are
