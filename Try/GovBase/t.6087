key from Unisys General Answers What is SeaDAS SeaDAS is a comprehensive image analysis package for processing displaying and analyzing all SeaWiFS Sea viewing Wide Field of view Sensor data products and ancillary data SeaWiFS data products include L0 L1A L1B L1A Browse L2 L2 Browse L3 Binned L3 Standard Mapped Image SMI and L3 Browse products Ancillary data include Wind Pressure Precipitable H20 and OZONE data from NCEP The source of the ozone data is EP TOMS In addition SeaDAS can also process OCTS MOS and CZCS data SeaDAS can only display but not process AVHRR SST and MODIS data The SeaDAS source code is FREE and available via FTP SeaDAS is supported by the NASA ocean biochemistry program under UPN S79 11 03 20 to C R Mcclain P I What are SeaWiFS Level 0 L0 Level 1A Level 1B 2 3 SMI and BROWSE data L0 Initial data from the SeaWiFS sensor Reconstructed unprocessed instrument payload data at full resolution L1A Reconstructed unprocessed instrument data at full resolution including radiometric and geometric calibration coefficients and georeferencing parameters i e platform ephemeris computed and appended but not applied to the L0 data L1B At sensor radiances derived by applying the sensor calibration to the Level 1A counts at the same resolution and location as the Level 1A data Only available with SeaDAS not available from the Goddard DAAC L2 Derived environmental variables at the same resolution and location as the L1 data L3 Binned Variables mapped on uniform space time grid scales usually with some completeness and consistency L3 SMI The Standard Mapped Image product is the image representation of the L3 binned data The product is a byte valued two dimensional array 4096 x 2048 representing an equidistant cylindrical projection of the globe BROWSE In general the browse products are subsampled raster images of the L1A L2 and L3 SMI files L1A browse is a Quasi true color composite of Bands 6 5 and 1 i e 670nm 555nm and 412nm with a Rayleigh correction applied to remove haze L2 browse is a subsampled raster image of the Level 2 chlorophyll a concentration product L3 browse is a subsampled raster image of the Level 3 SMI chlorophyll a concentration product See the data products http seawifs gsfc nasa gov SEAWIFS SOFTWARE DATA PRODUCTS html 1 web page under the http seawifs gsfc nasa gov SEAWIFS html SeaWiFS project for more detailed information How to order SeaWiFS data The NASA http daac gsfc nasa gov Goddard DAAC archives and distributes all SeaWiFS L1A LAC GAC and BROWSE data L2 GAC and BROWSE data and L3 Binned SMI and BROWSE data Only authorized users may access the DAAC for data Check the http seawifs gsfc nasa gov SEAWIFS html SeaWiFS home page to get information about how to apply for an authorized user account Can SeaDAS process MODIS CZCS or AVHRR data SeaDAS 4 1 can only process SeaWiFS OCTS MOS and CZCS data SeaDAS can display but not process AVHRR SST and MODIS Ocean data SeaDAS has no plans to provide processing capabilities for MODIS data In the future SeaDAS may include the capability to process and or display data from other satellites Why support just SGI SUN and PC Linux platforms The SeaWiFS Project is not able to support a full suite of machines with verified software When the SeaWiFS Project started it was determined that the vast majority of prospective users utilized either SUN or SGI workstations The SeaWiFS Project uses SGI workstations in their production processing environment SUN was the most widely used platform by prospective users The SeaWiFS Project decided to support providing a PC Linux version of SeaDAS once PC s became powerful enough to handle processing SeaWiFS data There are not any plans to support the Windows NT or Mac operating systems We encourage groups to provide ports to other platforms We would be able to distribute but not verify any user provided ports What is the difference between SeaDAS and the available SeaWiFS Project code SeaDAS is a stand alone package meant for individuals or groups who would like to generate and or analyze SeaWiFS data SeaDAS is more general than the SeaWiFS data processing system and provides interfaces which allow the user to control the input parameters of the processing programs The SeaWiFS Project code although designed to be as portable as possible will nevertheless be dependent on hardware graphics disks network nodes and software database SGI GL etc specific to the SeaWiFS data processing system It is a production system designed for data types data rates reprocessings computer systems and manpower that are beyond the requirements of SeaWiFS data users It is important to note that SeaDAS is capable of producing SeaWiFS Level 1 2 and 3 products identical to those generated by the production system given the same input files and parameters The defaults used by the SeaDAS programs match the parameters used by the SeaWiFS production processing system What is the difference between HRPT and LAC data HRPT data and LAC data have the same format and the same resolution They are different however HRPT data is broadcast continuously by the satellite for reception by the HRPT stations It is lost unless it is received by a ground station or recorded Each HRPT pass will at GSFC be kept as one image So HRPT scenes can range from very short if the satellite is at the horizon of the station to very long several minutes LAC Local Area Coverage data is actually RECORDED HRPT data downlinked with the GAC data and covers a very small area LAC data for calibration will be very short 1 min to cover the ground location of interest and cannot be very long the total LAC recording time is about 10 min Each time the recorder is turned on and off for whatever length of time it will constitute one LAC scene The highest priority for using LAC recording space will be for calibration purposes People needing LAC that is unavailable from an HRPT station should request it from the SeaWiFS Project Gene Feldman Specific Answers How do I get SeaDAS to automatically place my windows SeaDAS will automatically place your windows for you conveniently if you allow it to You must tell your window manager to allow applications to place their own windows To do this you must Modify your Xresources or Xdefaults file to tell your window manager to allow applications programs to determine window placement Restart your window manager Required in order for SeaDAS window positioning to work at all Mwm clientAutoPlace False Turn off automatic window placement by window manager Mwm interactivePlacement False Turn off user interactively positioning all windows Not required but can be convenient Mwm positionIsFrame True Widget positions given by applications programs include the frame NOTE If this is not on then the windows may overlap each other near the frames Mwm positionOnScreen False Don t let any windows get positioned off the screen NOTE Replace Mwm with 4Dwm in the following lines if you re running 4Dwm How do I change the background color of SeaDAS windows Modify your Xresources or Xdefaults file to include a line similar to the line below Use unix command showrgb to see available colors Update your resource database using command xrdb merge Xresources Start up SeaDAS Idl background peachpuff How do I change my SeaDAS widget font To select a widget font for your current SeaDAS session only Interactively Use the interactive command sdwfont found in the SeaDAS Main Menu under Utility Command mode Use the command setdef wfont Your default SeaDAS widget font is set in file SEADAS config seadas env in the environment variable SDSWFONT a To change the default widget font for everyone on your system you can change the value of SDSWFONT in the configuration file SEADAS config seadas env b To change the default for yourself permanently set your own value for SDSWFONT after sourcing seadas env in your login file Example source usr3 seadas config seadas env setenv SDSWFONT lucidasans bold 10 How do I change the default data range scalings for SeaWiFS products The default scalings are looked for first in the file seadas defaults in the user s home directory and secondly in the file SEADAS config seadas defaults To change scaling defaults for everyone running SeaDAS on your system you can modify the file SEADAS config seadas defaults To change scaling defaults for only your own SeaDAS sessions copy the system defaults file to your home directory and modify it cp SEADAS config seadas defaults seadas defaults NOTE If an entry is commented out or removed the default will be to scale the product to it s local min max data range Also currently product names containing blanks are not supported How do I kill a SeaDAS session if it hangs Look for your SeaDAS process ID and kill it It will appear in your main SeaDAS menu widget If your main widget is not up then issue the following command to find your idl session and kill the corresponding process id ps ef grep idl search for your idl session kill nnnn kill the process id associated with your idl session How do I create a nice looking SeaWiFS L1A true color image To create a nice looking true color image from SeaWiFS L1A data use the browse function found in the Process SeaWiFS menu This will allow you to create a L1A browse image at full resolution if desired To create an image at full resolution set the X and Y sampling rates to 1 The Load True option in the general display program does not give very clear results for true color since the Rayleigh correction has not been applied The browse program applies the Rayleigh correction when creating the L1A browse file Known Problems Anomalies Limitations Detailed answers l3bin program is currently dependent on 2 line elements files being kept up to date DATADAYS Error calculating start day ERROR RECENT NORAD TWO LINE ELEMENT FILE NOT FOUND FOR SEASTAR File does not exist or most recent file exceeds 30 days old Obtain updated element file Currently the l3bin program is dependent on the 2 line elements files in directory SEADAS data seawifs norad being kept fairly up to date We have plans to eliminate the need for this program to use these files However currently it will be necessary to keep these files updated They can be downloaded from ftp samoa gsfc nasa gov pub two line elements You may want to set up a cron job to download these automatically every day Load SEAPAK CZCS Does not handle map projected SEAPAK files Currently the display program is not able to navigate SEAPAK map projected files
