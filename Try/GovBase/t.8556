Glacier Studies Project includes three active tasks a http geochange er usgs gov pub info facts atlas index html Satellite Image Atlas of Glaciers of the World Task a http pubs usgs gov factsheet fs50 98 Coastal Change and Glaciological Maps of Antarctica Task and an Impact of Changing Climate on Alaskan Glaciers Task All three tasks are inter divisional inter agency and international in scope and institutional involvement Glaciers are one of the four components of the cryosphere the other three are sea lake and river ice snow cover and permafrost The cryosphere is particularly sensitive to changes in regional and global climate Seasonal changes in sea ice and snow cover and decadal changes in glacier area can be monitored regionally and globally with image data from Earth orbiting satellites NASA and USGS scientists are also carrying out experimental geodetic airborne satellite laser altimetry radar interferometric and other remote sensing surveys of glaciers Accomplishments The U S Geological Survey has played the lead national and international role in using satellite image data to provide baseline data and other information about glaciers from a global perspective The 11 volume Satellite Image Atlas of the World Task USGS Professional Paper 1386 A K involves more than 80 scientists who represent 45 institutions and 25 nations Seven volumes have been published to date B Antarctica C Greenland E Glaciers of Europe G Glaciers of the Middle East and Africa H Glaciers of Iran Jaya Indonesia and New Zealand I Glaciers of South America and J Glaciers of North America Within the Coastal Change and Glaciological Maps of Antarctica Task 700 Landsat MSS and TM images have been analyzed to provide for the first time Preparation of accurate RADARSAT images and Landsat 7 ETM images and 1 1 000 000 scale baseline maps in both printed and digital formats of the coast of Antarctica Compilation of accurate maps in both printed and digital formats which show coastal changes in floating ice fronts and grounded ice walls glacier ice during the past 30 years Determination of selected glacier ice velocities in some coastal regions Compilation of a comprehensive inventory of named and unnamed outlet glaciers and ice streams Compilation of a 1 5 000 000 scale map in both printed and digital formats of the continent of Antarctica One prototype map of the series has been published US Geological Survey Map I 2600 F Coastal Change and Glaciological Map of the Bakutis Coast Antarctica Seven maps I 2600 A G are currently in production Three maps of the Antarctic Peninsula I 2600 A C are being done as a joint effort with the British Antarctic Survey The impact of Changing Climate on Alaskan Glaciers Task is directed at compiling and collating all credible sources of observational data both historical and modern for comparison with present day changes to assess the impact of climate change on the glaciers of Alaska Types of data include the following proxy map aerial and ground photographs satellite images etc In addition to the Glaciers of Alaska 1386 K volume in the USGS Professional Paper 1386 series Satellite Image Atlas of Glaciers of the World comprehensive illustrated USGS reports A Century of Change on each of the 13 glacierized regions of Alaska will be prepared Data sets available online All Landsat images used in the
