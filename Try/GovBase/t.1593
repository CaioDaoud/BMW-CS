Pennsylvania Duration Graphs http www usgs gov USGS Home Page Duration and Current Conditions Graphs for Selected Pennsylvania Sites Duration and current conditions graphs are two ways to characterize the hydrologic status of Pennsylvania streams and ground water depths with respect to time and above normal normal or drought conditions The duration graphs linked to below are plots of the current 30 day moving averages of streamflows or depths to water below land surface as compared to historical data collected at the selected sites The 30 day moving averages are superimposed as black solid lines on graphs that display the historical data as the 25 to 75 percentile flows or depths normal conditions in a green band the 10 to 25 percentiles drought watch conditions in a yellow band the 5 to 10 percentiles drought warning conditions in an orange band and the 0 to 5 percentiles drought emergency conditions in a red band Whenever the black line on a graph is above the green band the 30 day moving average flow or depth is above normal Whenever the black line is below the red band the 30 day moving average flow or depth is less than the previously recorded low Note Due to smoothing of the curves the boundaries of the bands shown on the graphs represent approximate rather than actual 25 75 90 and 95 percentile and record low values The current conditions graphs linked to below are plots of recent instantaneous flows stages or depths recorded at the selected sites Medians for the period of record may be displayed on the flow graphs Funding for this particular display of drought related hydrologic data and continuing funding to maintain and enhance the display of these data are being provided by the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection and the U S Geological Survey To view the duration and current conditions graphs select one of the links below durplots stream duration html Streamflow Duration and Current Conditions Graphs durplots well duration html Ground Water Depth Duration and Current Conditions Graphs Return to the http pa water usgs gov Water Resources of Pennsylvania Home Page Go Home or go directly to footer links http pa water usgs gov pa hydro html Water Data http pa water usgs gov pa digit v2 html Map GIS Data http pa water usgs gov pa pubs html Publications http pa water usgs gov pa general html General Information http pa water usgs gov pa proj html Project Highlights http pa water usgs gov sitemap html Site Index http search usgs gov Search http www doi gov Dept of the Interior http www usgs gov USGS http water usgs gov USGS Water Resources http biology usgs gov USGS Biological Resources http mapping usgs gov USGS Mapping http geology usgs gov USGS Geology The URL for this page is http pa water usgs gov pa duration html Please note our http www usgs gov privacy html privacy statement and http www usgs gov disclaimer html disclaimer http www usgs gov accessibility html Accessibility Answers to many common questions can be found on our Frequently Asked Questions http pa water usgs gov pa faq html FAQ page Please direct content comments or questions to Information Specialist U S Geological Survey 215 Limekiln Road New Cumberland PA 17070 2424 Phone 717 730 6916 FAX 717 730 6997 Email http pa water usgs gov pa questions html is pa usgs gov or contact District Chief U S Geological Survey 215 Limekiln Road New Cumberland PA 17070 2424 Phone 717 730 6960 FAX 717 730 6997 Email http pa water usgs gov feedback forms todc html dc pa usgs gov Please direct web related comments to http pa water usgs gov pa feedback html webmaster pa water usgs gov
