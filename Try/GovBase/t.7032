egov gov E Gov initiative whose results will include an Internet portal that will be used for data discovery and exchange The components of the portal will be based on the framework standards currently being developed for all National Spatial Data Infrastructure NSDI Themes At present geospatial data are created and maintained by all levels of government They exist in numerous locations in a number of proprietary formats Exchanging data between and sometimes within the same organization is recognized as a labor intensive and problematic endeavor The Geospatial One Stop will overcome many of these issues through a collaborative effort to establish a comprehensive web portal to the NSDI seven framework html framework themes of geographic data Through this effort more accurate and accessible geospatial data will be available from local to national levels and will allow users to more effectively address security emergency economic social and environmental issues The following are some of the benefits that will result from the Geospatial One Stop Support geospatial data customers including Federal state local and other agencies as well as private citizens by providing a common consistent source of geospatial data for all e government uses Support security and emergency response services Build upon existing capabilities to accelerate the development of the NSDI Save money for all parties by providing a market for data acquisition partnership opportunities and by making existing data more accessible Implementing the data exchange portion of the Geospatial One Stop will be accomplished with two interdependent efforts First integrating the NSDI framework themes into the Geospatial One Stop will be accomplished through the development of a framework data content standard html standard for each theme Federal state and local governments plus private sector and academia are cooperating and collaborating to develop an essential data framework standard needed for the exchange of information These national standards are designed so that they can be easily implemented with existing software The second involves developing data identification and exchange tools that use these new standards When both efforts are combined the result will be to provide geospatial data with one stop Internet access for easier data sharing Within the NSDI Transportation theme the Bureau of Transportation Statistics BTS is responsible for coordinating the development of the framework standard Transportation is unique since different modes use different transportation networks This is reflected in the development of framework standard for each mode highways railways air and transit BTS is using the following process to develop these standards Identify interested organizations and individuals to participate html participate in the standards development process Gather requirements from each mode specific group Conduct meetings to develop consensus Work with the
