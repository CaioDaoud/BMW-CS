network of wells to monitor the effects of droughts and other climate variability on ground water levels The network consists of a national network of about 150 wells monitored as part of the Ground Water Resources Program supplemented by wells in some States monitored as part of the Cooperative Water Program About these Pages color black These web pages integrate site information from NWISWeb location maps and ground water hydographs For wells with five or more years of daily record the daily values are plotted on a background of the historical minimum maximum and median measurements for each day The data used in the statistics can be viewed in a table or retrieved as a tab delimited file Statistics are based on the final approved daily values and each hydrograph lists the number of values upon which the statistics are based Recent data presented in these hydrographs have not yet been approved and are termed provisional data These data are not considered final until they are approved by the USGS Director usually in April or May for the previous water year ending on September 30 These pages serve data from wells which meet the following climate response criteria Open to a single known hydrogeologic unit Known well construction that allows good water level measurements Located in unconfined aquifers or near surface confined aquifers that respond to climatic fluctuations Minimally affected by pumpage and likely to remain so Essentially unaffected by irrigation canals and other potential sources of artificial recharge Long term accessibility Well has never gone dry not susceptible to going dry There are three types of data available from wells measured by the USGS 1 periodic data which are ground water levels measured manually at selected intervals usually with a steel or electric tape These measurements typically are made from once per week to once per year 2 continuous data which are ground water levels measured by an automatic sensing device recorded by data loggers and retrieved periodically from the field The availability of these data may lag current conditions by one to several months because they must be retrieved from the field processed and loaded into the database 3 real time data which are continuous data that are transmitted from the field to the USGS at least once per day Barring occasional equipment malfunctions these data reflect current ground water conditions at the well The Climate Response Network pages serve ground water level data from selected wells These pages do not serve all of the wells monitored by the USGS in each state Additional well data from each state are available from NWISWeb which contains data from about 800 000 wells across the United States and Puerto Rico Related Links http water usgs gov waterwatch
