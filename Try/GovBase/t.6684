Global poster LANL Access Grid enables interactive learning Beyond its use during the SC Global events the LANL AG node serves as an important research and education tool In October LANL researchers used the AG to participate in a grid programming workshop hosted by the Ohio Supercomputing Center After viewing an interactive lecture LANL participants were able to write sample code and via the AG run test parallel programs on an Ohio supercomputer LANL s AG node also is key to an educational outreach effort in New Mexico In collaboration with the University of New Mexico Jim Morel of CCS 4 uses the AG to teach a graduate level course on radiation transport Over three semesters he uses the AG to teach local students and remote students at a range of sites including UNM Albuquerque and

LANL Showcases Interaction Technology of the Future On November 18 20 2003 LANL will be part of SC Global a virtual conference to discuss the latest developments and challenges facing digital collaboration via the Access Grid AG The AG is a web based videoconferencing system that allows you to share audio video and software tools worldwide As an open source community driven system the AG is changing the way humans communicate and collaborate Photo cell phones instant messaging and the Access Grid New digital technologies emerge every day that change the way humans connect with one another to solve problems share task related information or simply catch up Who would have imagined that one day you could record pictures and messages with your cell phone then send them to another person s phone And who would have imagined that chat rooms and instant messaging would enable you to have a real time conversation with someone thousands of miles away without a telephone The Access Grid AG is an uber technology that is taking digital communication and collaboration to a whole new level As a Web based conferencing system it allows you to share audio video and software tools across sites worldwide It joins entire groups of people from communities far and wide rural and urban high speed and low tech into a virtual workspace that allows them to get the right people and data together at the right time The AG is built on a collection of access nodes specific locations that have the high end audio and visual technology needed to provide a compelling interactive experience LANL hosts an Access Grid node at TA 3 Bldg 200 Room 115 Other Access Grid sites in New Mexico include several hosted by the Tribal Virtual Network a consortium of Native American tribes who are using the Access Grid to join members of rural villages into a cohesive community LANL Access Grid broadcasts during SC Global LANL s AG node will take center stage November 18 20 as part of SC Global a virtual conference to discuss issues facing collaboration via the AG SC Global will feature presentations by speakers across 5 continents including 16 remote locations 7 countries and 5 sovereign tribal nations Participants at LANL s AG node will be able to view and interact with all of the SC Global presentations SC Global is part of SC2003 a supercomputing conference that highlights the most
