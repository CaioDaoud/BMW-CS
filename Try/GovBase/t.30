Shoreline Analysis System DSAS version 2 0 extends the normal functionality of the http www esri com ArcView version 3 2 and later geographic information system to include historic shoreline change analysis The DSAS 2 0 was developed by the USGS in cooperation with http www tpmc com Technical Planning and Management Corporation TPMC The application extension is designed to efficiently lead a user through the major steps of shoreline change analysis in a clearly organized and attractive user interface This extension to ArcView contains three main components to assist a user to define a baseline generate orthogonal transects at a user defined separation along the coast and to calculate rates of change linear regression endpoint rate average of rates average of endpoints jackknife The extension utilizes Avenue code to develop transects and rates and uses the Avenue programming environment to automate and customize the user interface If you would like to receive announcements of DSAS updates via e mail please contact mailto rthieler usgs gov Rob Thieler The Digital Shoreline Analysis System DSAS 2 0 does not currently run under ArcView ArcGis 8 If you would like to see this
