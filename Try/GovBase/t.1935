Conference is available null CONTACT Trevor Francis FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE 202 482 4883 July 24 2003 The Bush Administration today announced unprecedented federal initiatives designed to organize the federal government s climate change science research system along with funding for global climate observation The new historic initiative brings together the resources and expertise of 13 federal agencies The Climate Change Science Program CCSP a joint federal program of the President s Committee on Climate Change Science and Technology Integration has issued its stratplan2003 default htm strategic plan to address some of the most complex questions and problems dealing with long term global climate variability and change It reflects an unprecedented outreach to interested parties including some 1 200 scientists and stakeholders and representatives of over 35 countries The document describes a strategy for developing knowledge of variability and change in climate and related environmental and human systems and for encouraging the application of this knowledge Commerce Secretary Don Evans Secretary of Commerce Don Evans also announced a 103 million two year federal initiative to accelerate the deployment of new global observation technologies focused on oceans and atmospheric aerosols and carbon This initiative will provide critical data needed to improve mankind s understanding of global climate change and the ability of all nations to apply their knowledge The Bush Administration has brought a total government spending on climate change related programs to 4 5 billion This critical investment announced today will accelerate select high priority research projects and climate observations that will help us fill critical knowledge gaps President Bush has asked his advisors to consider approaches to reduce greenhouse gas emissions including those that tap the power of markets help realize the promise of technology and ensure the widest possible global participation The stratplan2003 default htm Climate Change Strategic Plan brings together for the first time the resources and expertise of 13 federal agencies It sets forth a vision mission and goals based on the principles articulated by President Bush when he established the about ccri htm Climate Change Research Initiative CCRI said Don Evans secretary of Commerce and chairman of the administration s Committee on Climate Change Science and Technology Integration Those principles include Adopt a measured approach based on the best science Remain flexible able to adapt to new discoveries and technology Leverage the power of markets and technological innovation Ensure global participation Ensure continued economic growth The strategic plan will advance the state of knowledge of climate variability the potential response of the climate system and related human and environmental systems to human induced changes in the atmosphere and land surface and the implications of these potential changes and management options for natural environments The plan will also support scientific discovery and excellence and encourage partnerships that facilitate the use of knowledge to protect the Earth s environment and ensure a safer healthier planet for future generations According to Spencer Abraham secretary of Energy and co chairman of the Committee on Climate Change Science and Technology Integration This plan identifies four core approaches that will serve as the backbone to achieving its mission Those areas are identified as science observations decision support and communications By focusing in these specific areas we can focus on moving in new scientific directions employing new research activities filling critical data gaps through observations developing operational tools for decision makers and managers and communicating results across communities and across borders Working within the core constructs the plan outlines five overarching scientific goals aimed at addressing key questions and uncertainties They include Extend knowledge of the Earth s past and present climate and environment including its natural variability and improve understanding of the causes of observed changes Improve understanding of the forces bringing about changes in the Earth s climate and related systems Reduce uncertainty in projections of how the Earth s climate and environmental systems may change in the future Understand the sensitivity and adaptability of different natural and managed systems to climate and associated global changes Explore the uses and identify the limits of evolving knowledge to manage risks and opportunities related to climate variability and change The CCSP strategic plan is a framework to address some of the most complex questions and problems that our nation and the world now face said retired Navy Vice Adm Conrad C Lautenbacher Ph D undersecretary of commerce for oceans and atmosphere and NOAA administrator The issue of climate variability and change the level and potential affects of human contributions to these issues and how we adapt and manage our response is a capstone issue for our generation and those to follow James R Mahoney assistant secretary of Commerce for oceans and atmosphere deputy NOAA administrator and director of the CCSP stated This plan leverages existing knowledge to learn new things builds bridges across communities and scientific disciplines to gain greater insight reaches out to decision makers to put knowledge into action We are committed to maintaining an open and transparent process to ensure that our partners are heard and we hear them It stakes out new scientific ground in the area of climate change modeling and observations and promises to adapt to new technology and discoveries Reacting to the unveiling of the CCSP Bruce Alberts president of the National Academy of Sciences said the following I highly commend Jim Mahoney for his insistence on soliciting the widest possible scientific input into the US government s important Strategic Plan for Climate Change Science As our government sets national priorities for global change research it is critical that it have access to leading scientists I am of course especially pleased that he has asked the National Academies to conduct an open high quality review of both the draft and revised versions of the Strategic Plan Our committee chaired by Thomas Graedel of Yale University has already reviewed the draft strategic plan working to provide constructive advice for its revision This committee will continue to provide useful guidance to the Climate Change Science Program from a group of the nation s best scientists and it will meet again this August to begin its review of the revised Strategic Plan On the Internet CCSP and the strategic plan http www climatescience gov http www climatescience gov US Climate Change Science Program Suite 250 1717 Pennsylvania
