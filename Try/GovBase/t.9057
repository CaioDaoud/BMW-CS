by the http www climatescience gov Climate Change Science Program CCSP participating agencies coordinate many of their programs with those of their counterparts in other countries thus providing essential inputs to the increasingly complex models that enable scientists to improve analysis and prediction of global change Some highlights of recent ongoing and planned global change research and related activities in which CCSP supported scientists are heavily involved and for which international cooperation participation and support are especially important include Bilateral Cooperation on Climate Change Research and Technology President Bush has stressed the role of bilateral cooperation in addressing climate change acknowledging that all countries must actively work together to achieve the long term goal of stabilizing greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that will prevent dangerous human interference with the climate system The United States has moved forward aggressively to build on our already extensive bilateral relationships with key partners in the developed and developing world including the European Union Italy Japan China India and Australia and we intend over the next year to expand bilateral discussions to include a number of additional countries The White House announced in July 2001 that the United States and Italy had agreed to cooperate in climate change research and technology within four broad areas global and regional climate modeling atmospheric studies related to climate carbon cycle research and low carbon technologies see http usinfo state gov topical global climate 01071901 htm United States and Italy Pledge Joint Research on Climate Change press release US Department of State 19 July 2001 As the first step in developing such cooperation science program managers from both countries met in Rome in January 2002 The objectives of this initial interaction were to identify first specific scientific areas in which joint research is needed and second specific actions to develop such research and a timetable for these actions see http usinfo state gov topical global climate 02012301 htm U S Italy

developed at the second meeting of the Climate Change Science and Technology Working Group which had been established earlier through U S Japan High Level Consultations This meeting was conducted under the June 2001 agreement of President Bush and Prime Minister Koizumi to undertake high level U S Japan government to government consultations to explore common ground and areas for common action on climate change The two sides identified more than 40 joint climate change science and technology research activities for possible implementation see http usinfo state gov topical global climate

Observations in Support of Global Change Research To expand international cooperation the President has announced that the United States will invest 25 million in climate observing systems in developing countries The primary goal is to promote development and expansion of global observing systems through the http www wmo ch web gcos gcoshome html Global Climate Observation System GCOS and the http www argo ucsd edu Argo program for ocean observations through further multilateral and bilateral cooperative efforts similar to those already initiated International Cooperation in Satellite Remote Sensing NASA leads the United States cooperation with other countries in a broad range of satellite remote sensing activities in support of global change research These programs have strong

Republic of China Chinese Academy of Sciences China Meteorological Administration CMA The United States and China continue a collaboration in climate sciences with a focus on the comparative study of regional climate change in both countries Key components include preparing climate data for validating and improving global and regional general circulation climate models and using the improved models to understand and project regional climate changes and the associated impacts resulting from increasing greenhouse gases and aerosols due to anthropogenic activities Recent major accomplishments in this area include the development of a 2000 year time series of winter half year temperature reconstructions primarily from rainfall data for the middle and lower reaches of the Yellow and Yangtze Rivers and measurements primarily of methane of emissions from agricultural systems in China and their effects on the carbon cycle The Science Team for this study plans to meet
