delighted to be joining all of you here in a city that has represented the uncharted hopes of new opportunity to millions of people Speaking on behalf of the United States government we are extremely proud to participate in the largest Partnership for Prosperity event so far I have already heard about many of the successes and accomplishments we ve achieved at this Workshop and know all of us will hear much more in the coming months about the relationships we re establishing and strengthening here in San Francisco We have all traveled here because of the vast potential in the relationship between our two countries Mexico and the United States share more than a border We share trade culture and family ties that come with close friendships Every day thousands of our citizens cross the border to work to play and to visit family and friends As a Texan I ve known about the links between our countries for a long time But I m still amazed by the growth in those links especially in the decade since we signed the North American Free Trade Agreement Without a doubt NAFTA has exceeded our wildest expectations and done great things for our trading relationship It s set an example for the world of the shared benefits of free trade and open markets In 1999 Mexico passed Japan as our second largest trading partner In 2002 total U S Mexico trade exceeded 232 billion Let s put that statistic into manageable numbers It works out to be about half a million dollars a minute Think about how much merchandise will have crossed the border between now and the time we adjourn this afternoon NAFTA has been good for both Mexico and the United States While Europe and Japan are mired with anemic growth rates and negative growth the United States continues to grow There is no question that part of the explanation for our sustained growth during a global downturn is the level playing field and open markets we re creating in North America But many of you already know that and that s why you re here to gain insights into Mexico and the United States More importantly you re here to meet with your counterparts from the other side of the border and cultivate new relationships You re here to discover new avenues that will allow you your companies and your families to build on our amazing and growing trade relationship The vast majority of the trade that takes place each day between our countries is seamless Cargoes cross our border at an amazing pace But not all of it travels as swiftly as it should There are still troublesome impediments that are compromising NAFTA s promise of open markets and a level playing field As President Reagan said twenty years ago We and our trading partners are in the same boat If one partner shoots a hole in the boat it makes no sense for the other partner to shoot another hole in the boat That s not getting tough it s getting wet And eventually it means sinking the boat that s headed for greater growth and prosperity When countries trade at the volume we do when goods and services cross our borders with such frequency some problems are inevitable Our challenge is to resolve them promptly and permanently to address these issues early so that they re solved before they can weaken our broader bilateral relationship Mexico and America are truly in the same boat We share a common destiny We have to sweep the obstacles aside No temporary advantage is worth delaying the day when our countries realize the full benefits of an open transparent and expanded trading relationship Earlier today I began sharing some of the concerns we ve heard from U S industry with my friend Secretary Canales These concerns range from adequate protection of intellectual property rights to regulatory transparency to non tariff barriers to trade and to agriculture Secretary Canales and I both know that the best way to enhance our trade relationship is to address these problems I know that in the past day Mexico has announced measures to improve competitiveness by making it easier to move goods across the border I applaud those steps and encourage the Fox Administration to do more We want the best for both our countries and there is no question that dissolving trade barriers is in our mutual interest Capital investment is fickle It flows to stable and secure markets As the largest recipient of foreign direct investment in Latin America Mexico clearly understands this principle The challenge is to continue making the required changes to retain Mexico s success in the global race to attract capital The United States and Mexico have a relationship that goes far beyond dollars and cents We share the goals of greater prosperity for our people better schools safer neighborhoods and secure borders so that we can leave a better place for our children and grandchildren Nations don t always agree but friendships as strong as ours allow us to work through any issue in pursuit of this shared goal As Mexico continues to grow under the leadership of President Fox and the members of his team our interests and objectives will become increasingly similar We will work together to expand opportunity We will seek the best from each other And we will lead our countries to boldly pursue a free trading hemisphere We have seen incredible coordination through the Smart Border Initiative just one example of our expanded cooperation to address common concerns and objectives At the same time Mexico has a growing obligation to offer leadership in the drive to expand free trade We need to work together so that other countries in the region can join the rising tide of opportunity and prosperity A Free Trade Area of the Americas would greatly benefit every democratic country in the Western Hemisphere raising living standards for all and lowering costs for consumers But we re unlikely to achieve an FTAA without Mexico s leadership Free trade has been good for Mexico Millions of Mexicans lead fuller and more satisfying lives because of economic progress fostered by NAFTA Hundreds of millions of lives can be improved by extending that same freedom to our neighboring countries Mexico needs to expand on the commitment from the United States through NAFTA by boldly explaining the advantages in trading freely to other Latin American countries In this way we can foster economic growth promote regional integration and strengthen democracies from Alaska to Tierra del Fuego As President Bush has said We have a great vision before us a fully democratic hemisphere bound together by good will and free trade Our strong vibrant relationship was built with hard work and common vision It flows from a conscious effort on the part of our people to pursue common dreams and universal aspirations So what does all of that mean for you representatives of the Mexican and U S private sectors How exactly does all of this high level nvolvement affect your bottom line I spent my career in the private sector and know that at the end of the day that s the question you have to answer You need to know for yourselves your investors and your boards of directors Those of us serving in government are working to create the conditions under which the private sector can prosper The recent passage of President Bush s Jobs and Growth plan is just one recent example Governments provide the frame but the private sector paints the canvas And that s the objective of this Workshop We re here to give all of you a chance to speak with government officials to raise concerns to ask questions and to identify the policies that we need to improve to expand trade even further I urge you to act on those changes when you return to home There are six billion people in the world and three billion live on less than two dollars a day There is too much poverty There is not enough hope There is too much despair in too many parts of the world We have a responsibility to do something about it I ve visited most of this country and I ve seen a good deal of the world Everywhere I go the men and women I meet all seek the same things They hunger for the blessings that freedom offers They want food for their families They want a roof over their heads They want an education for their children And all of us want raise our families in peace and security The pursuit of these basic elements of liberty and happiness is a universal dream that unites mankind I ve made a point on my foreign visits including to Mexico a year ago to visit the places where American corporations are demonstrating a commitment to those in need I understand that yesterday afternoon you discussed this issue U S and Mexican companies described the steps they are taking to help people in need in their communities At the same session Mexico and the United States announced the creation of the Good Partner Award This honor will be to be presented every year to the companies that best demonstrate the ideals behind this Partnership Let me encourage the business communities in both our countries to join the effort Learn from their example and bring your own innovations to this mission You don t have to be a Fortune 500 company to practice corporate stewardship Make a contribution to the lives of the people in your communities in Mexico and in the United States I d like to again congratulate all of you for having the vision to see the potential that exists in this bilateral relationship The Partnership for Prosperity is a partnership in every sense of the word And as we work together as governments and in the private sector we can achieve the objectives so eloquently expressed by our Presidents To help unfetter the economic potential of every citizen so each may contribute fully to narrowing the economic gaps between and within our societies Partners I look forward to working closely with you on a journey that has already made North America more prosperous and that will one day extend opportunity to every inch of our hemisphere Thank you US Department of Commerce 1401 Constitution Avenue NW Washington DC 20230 Last Updated October 17 2003 3 00 PM Contact Secretary Evans by email at mailto devans
