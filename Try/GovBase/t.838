international partners annually holds the International Common Criteria Conference which draws attendance from user organizations IT vendors and testing labs The purpose of the conference is to further use and understanding of the Common Criteria The conference helps ensure that not only do we have truly global standards for certifying commercial software products but that these bring real benefits for both commercial suppliers and end users in both government and the public sector Contact mailto peggy himes nist gov Peggy Himes http niap nist gov niap services cc classes html Common

encryption Standards Under its statutory responsibilities NIST develops standards and guidelines to protect sensitive federal systems While these standards formally apply only within the Federal government many organizations in the private sector voluntarily choose to adopt them as well particularly those in the area of cryptography These standards are formally known as Federal Information

Ron Ross http csrc nist gov cryptval The Cryptographic Module Validation Program jointly led by NIST and the Government of Canada s Communications Security Establishment provides for the voluntary testing of cryptographic modules both hardware and software Testing is conducted against the security specifications detailed in Security Requirements for Cryptographic Modules Testing is also conducted to help assure the correct implementation of specific cryptographic algorithms approved to protect sensitive information in the Federal government Note that cryptographic modules are typically not sold directly to consumers but are integrated into commercially available products Contact mailto ray snouffer nist gov Ray Snouffer http centennial nist gov NIST Centennial Logo Last
