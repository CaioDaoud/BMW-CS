301 443 3376 HHS AWARDS 16 MILLION TO 31 HEALTH CENTERS TO EXPAND ACCESS TO COMPREHENSIVE HEALTH CARE SERVICES FOR THE UNINSURED HHS Secretary Tommy G Thompson today announced 31 new grants totaling 16 million to help communities across America create comprehensive health care centers that will provide health services to an estimated 254 000 people including many without health insurance Today s grants continue President Bush s five year Health Centers Initiative which will add 1 200 new and expanded health center sites and increase the number of people served annually from about 10 million to 16 million by 2006 These grants will help provide care for many uninsured Americans and others who otherwise would have had no place to turn to get help Secretary Thompson said With more than 40 million Americans lacking health insurance President Bush has proposed a broad range of initiatives to help as many people as possible as quickly as possible Health centers play a critical role in this effort by providing a safety net for patients regardless of their ability to pay Health centers deliver preventive and primary care to patients regardless of their ability to pay Almost half of the patients treated at health centers have no insurance coverage and others have inadequate coverage Charges for health care services are set according to income and fees are not collected from the poorest clients HHS Health Resources and Services Administration HRSA manages the Consolidated Health Center Program which funds a national network of community health centers migrant health centers health care for the homeless centers public housing primary care centers and school based health centers Millions of Americans rely on health centers every day to provide the care and services their
