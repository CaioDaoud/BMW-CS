of Pioneer Seamount cable This map shows the location of the submarine cable off the central California coast that is being used for the Sound in the Sea Project This cable stretches from Pillar Point Air Force Station to an underwater seamount Pioneer Seamount and is approximately 100 km long A passive underwater hydrophone has been installed on the seaward end of the cable Data on recorded sounds is sent along the cable to a station on land for processing then made available over the Internet Click image for larger view August 27 to September 4 2001 audio icon http www pmel noaa gov vents

miles offshore If funding can be obtained to repair the cable then the live data display will be restored audio icon http www bbc co uk worldservice programmes archive 030430 molecule shtml Listen to Chief Scientist Chris Fox discuss the mysteries of sound in the sea during an interview broadcast on BBC Select programme three Requires Real Player In late August scientists sailed from San Francisco to Pioneer Seamount off the coast of central California and installed underwater hydrophones known as an array The hydrophones allow researchers to remotely monitor and record ocean sound to further their understanding of the sources and effects of ocean noise The ocean sound data is now being transmitted live over the Internet Passive underwater acoustic monitoring allows the detection of a variety of deep ocean processes at long distances Some of the sound sources to be studied include earthquakes volcanic eruptions landslides marine mammal and fish vocalizations weather and manmade noises The experience gained from this effort may enable scientists to expand the hydrophone arrays to other underwater cables that can be retrofitted Ultimately this could lead to a monitoring network capable of acoustic exploration throughout much of the global ocean Background information for this exploration can be found on the left side of the page Daily updates are included below More detailed logs of exploration activities can be found on the right DAILY UPDATES Apr 24 2002 After a short period of inactivity the hydrophone array is delivering data again logs apr24 02 apr24 02 html

The new location of the hydrophone array was determined early this morning The NOAA Ship Ronald H Brown is now in transit to San Diego Along the way a mapping team will gather data on the seafloor Aug 31 The science team has arrived at the location of the submerged cable and will spend the day attempting to raise it so testing can begin If all goes well the team should install the hydrophone array by nightfall Aug 30 The NOAA Ship Ronald H Brown has been mobilized in Seattle WA and is in transit to San Francisco CA to pick up the science party The team will then transit to the cable site to
