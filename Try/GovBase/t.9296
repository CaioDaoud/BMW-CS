WHITE HOUSE CLOSING THE CIRCLE AWARDS 2004 Instructions and Nomination Form We cordially invite you to participate in the 2004 White House Closing the Circle CTC Awards This program recognizes Federal employees and their facilities for efforts which resulted in significant contributions to or have made a significant impact on the environment The awards focus on waste prevention recycling and green purchasing activities under E O 13101 environmental management under E O 13148 and green sustainable buildings under both executive orders Important Changes to Note Now in our tenth year we continue to seek exemplary success stories that can set the example for other Federal facilities to follow This year we have made several changes to the awards categories First recognizing our belief that Federal agencies should have one comprehensive green purchasing program rather than separate programs for buying recycled content environmentally preferable and biobased products we have combined the affirmative procurement environmental preferability and biobased categories into one green purchasing category We will instruct the judges to give preference to programs that consist of both a buy recycled component and either an environmentally preferable products component or a biobased products component However for this year successful candidates are not required to have a program containing all three components Second we believe that education and outreach are key tools to successful programs and should be an integral part of successful waste pollution prevention recycling green purchasing environmental management or sustainable building efforts Therefore rather than continuing to have a separate education and outreach nomination category we have incorporated education and outreach into the other categories Third continuing our emphasis on facility use of environmental management systems and sustainable design for building construction and renovation we are continuing the Environmental Management System and Sustainable Design Green Buildings categories Fourth we are no longer requesting that nominees distinguish between non hazardous waste and hazardous waste projects We will accept nominations for programs involving either hazardous or non hazardous waste and instruct the judges to select the best projects regardless of waste type Finally we will continue to consider nominations from either an individual Federal employee or teams groups of Federal employees including teams of Federal and contract employees Partnerships between Federal facilities or Federal employees and non Federal entities such as surrounding local communities or non profit organizations will also be considered for award Award Categories for 2004 wp Waste
