goals of the Federal Highway Administration FHWA To do so requires effectively maintaining and expanding the existing infrastructure At the core of this infrastructure are pavements Improving pavement performance however is a complex and ongoing challenge To address this challenge FHWA maintains a robust suite of pavement research programs Each of these programs share a common goal to provide highway managers and engineers with the information and tools they need to design build and maintain better performing pavements To do so several of the programs focus on the structural design material mix and construction specifications that will yield better performing pavements Others focus on the development of tools highway managers need to implement new or refined technological solutions Ultimately the combined results of these efforts seek to provide motorists with more durable user responsive and cost effective pavement systems Learn more about TFHRC Pavements Research
