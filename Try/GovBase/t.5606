The objectives of the conference was to define specific restoration goals determine the best approaches to meet these goals and provide benchmarks that could be used to measure the success of restoration efforts over time To these ends the conference recognized the need to synthesize information gathered since the first Everglades conference the interdisciplinary nature of Everglades restoration and the need to adapt scientific understanding to management action geer 2000 Learn more workshops waterquality photo of scientist collecting a water sample workshops waterquality USGS
