Where will DHS be located Effective Monday January 27 the Department of Homeland Security headquarters will be located at the Nebraska Avenue Center NAC in Northwest Washington D C The selection of this site coincides with the establishment of the new Department which officially stands up on Friday January 24 The NAC is a United States Navy facility which provides the secure connectivity needed to begin operations immediately Headquarters for the new Department will remain at the NAC for at least a period of several months The vast majority of incoming DHS employees based in the Washington D C area will continue to work at their current locations How does the mission of the Department of Homeland Security differ from those of other agencies The new Department of Homeland Security DHS has three primary missions Prevent terrorist attacks within the United States reduce America s vulnerability to terrorism and minimize the damage from potential attacks and natural disasters Working with DHS My associates and I provide services that we think DHS could use We would like to know more about business partnership opportunities What is or will be available and who should we contact As you know uniting 22 agencies is a complicated reorganization process Each agency brings its own set of skills and services and our primary goal is to utilize the services our agencies will provide The best way to bring a new idea to the table at this time is to contact the agency that needs it most The Department of Homeland Security as a whole cannot accept other solicitations at this time Will DHS have an office in my state Can I get a job there An essential part of homeland security is working with the local stakeholders around the country As Secretary Designate Ridge has said When our hometowns are secure our nation will be secure As we finalize the structure of the Department of Homeland Security we will establish regional offices to which our citizens can turn It is a critical function of homeland security to ensure that our state and local governments police fire departments paramedics and concerned citizens are able to connect with local people representing the department Where and how these regions will be drawn is an issue upon which we are still working When positions do become available on the regional level they will be posted on the OPM website at www USAJOBS opm gov I would like to volunteer at the new Department What qualifications do I need Can I volunteer at locations across the country How do I apply The successful prevention of terrorist attacks will rest partly on the active participation of all American citizens Please check the Citizens link on our home page to read about some of the many ways you can be prepared to help as DHS continues to grow At this time we do not have a volunteer program established at DHS headquarters We do want your help so please continue to check our web site for updates on new opportunities How can I get a job at the new Department of Homeland Security We realize that there is a lot of excitement and interest in DHS and we believe that the success of DHS will rest largely on the enthusiasm and dedication of
