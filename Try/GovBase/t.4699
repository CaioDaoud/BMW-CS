thing anyone needs at this joyous and gift giving time of year is to be cheated by con artists of every stripe online offline and on the other end of your telephone That s why a sleighful of FBI Criminal Investigative experts got together today to outline some of the scams these modern day Grinches may try to pull on you and your loved ones and to offer tips on how you can protect yourselves from becoming victims of fraud this holiday season and throughout the year Nearly 2 500 FBI Agents around the country and around the world are working hard to prevent and catch these con artists said Grant Ashley who heads up the Bureau s Criminal Investigative Division Last year we investigated more than 20 000 fraud cases of all kinds insurance fraud telemarketing fraud securities fraud health care fraud and financial institution fraud Those investigations led to the recovery or restitution of more than 10 billion of fraudulently stolen funds Beware of scams like these Fake credit unions Con artists place ads in newspapers for non existent credit unions offering hassle free loans if you wire them a fee of 1 500 Or they have you fill out a loan application and then steal your personal information Debt or mortgage elimination offers The perpetrators of these schemes offer to take advantage of loopholes in the system that will eliminate your entire mortgage for an up front fee Don t believe it There are no loopholes Phony lotteries Scam artists will notify you that you ve won a lottery but you must send them some money to receive your winnings Sad fact there is no lottery and you never receive a prize Protect yourself and report possible crimes If you come across anyone attempting these or other suspicious activities please report them to your local FBI office or police department A few simple precautions can help keep you from being Grinched Never give personal information over the telephone mail or Internet unless you initiated the contact Shred credit card receipts and old financial statements Protect PIN numbers and passwords Carry a minimum amount of identifying information Do not wire money to strangers Fraud can happen anywhere said AD Ashley on the street at your front door on the telephone or on the computer The best thing individuals can do is be aware If a deal looks like it s too good to be true it probably is For more information and more
