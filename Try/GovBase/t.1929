Resources Through Sanctuary educational and interpretive programs the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration seeks to broaden public awareness and understanding of the marine resources at Gray s Reef Direct access to the reef itself requires experience in open ocean diving thus limiting the opportunity for a firsthand encounter with the Sanctuary environment For this reason the educational programs focus on land based interpretive themes and exhibits Educational Materials Gray s Reef National Marine Sanctuary sponsors community outreach marine programs public seminars presentations and exhibits Education publications include an illustrated fishguide html fish guide handbooks html educational handbooks useful to teachers interested in a marine curriculum and a new

Questions students ask about Gray s Reef and a list of student careers html Marine Science Careers Gray s Reef also has educational poster html posters available to teachers which were created by Gray s Reef and the University of Georgia s Marine Extension Service Programs To support teachers locally and throughout the state and those not able to bring students to the coast Gray s Reef has developed several different educational programs The modules help teachers instruct their students about endangered species in in their own backyards motivates students to investigate fresh water and ocean ecosystems and reveals the fascinating secrets of the northern right whale These modules include a teacher s guide with work sheets for copying complete activity video tape as well The activities have all been classroom tested and deemed educational and fun by participating students The modules are targeted for different grade levels and are free for the asking In addition to the distant learning programs and the educational modules Gray s Reef provides the opportunity for local area high school students to participate in the studentcouncil html Student Ocean Council program Distance Learning Through Georgia s distance learning network we are able to teach and interact live with as many as seven classes across the state simultaneously With slides and video footage we are able to bring the reef to life Students in downtown Atlanta and from the peanut farms of Plains and in the mountain community of Helen go beneath the ocean with us to explore Gray s Reef without ever getting wet The students ask us questions about the fish and especially the sharks we see and if we ve ever run out of air while diving there To further aid teachers locally and throughout the state and especially those not able to bring students to the coast Gray s Reef has developed several different educational modules The modules help teachers instruct their students about endangered species

grade levels and are free for the asking Sea Turtles Gray s Reef is an ideal habitat for the threatened loggerhead sea turtle The ledges and overhangs of the reef provide the loggerhead sea turtle with protected resting spots a bountiful resource of food and close proximity to nesting sites on barrier island beaches Observations by sanctuary staff have documented the presence of various size and age groups of loggerhead sea turtles within the sanctuary Surprisingly little is known about the sea turtle s daily and seasonal behavior or their use of the ocean habitats especially off the coast of Georgia Most of the studies on these marine reptiles have focused on more accessible nesting behavior and post nesting movement of adult females while little work has been conducted on the rest of the sea turtle population Satellite telemetry can significantly contribute to the study of an animal that is inaccessible or difficult to follow The satellite based location and data collection system allows a transmitter attached to an animal to be located to within 150 meters Environmental parameters i e temperature collected by sensors attached to the transmitter are also available thereby providing specific location and environmental conditions for a tagged animal over time Follow turtletag html loggerhead sea turtles in the ocean with satellite transmitters Other
