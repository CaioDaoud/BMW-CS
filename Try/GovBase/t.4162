GCN BACODINE 661 Phillip A Newman 1 Scott D Barthelmy 1 Karen M Smale 1 The GRB Coordinates Network is a system that distributes locations of GRBs detected by spacecraft and distributes follow up observation reports submitted by the GRB community GCN The GRB Coordinates Network sys status html System Status Latest update 06 Dec 03 Schematic drawing showing network of x ray and gamma ray satellites sending data through a downlink to GCN and then information travelling to radio and optical sites for afterglow studies TABLE OF CONTENTS tc1 The Very Brief Description tc2 Introductions tc3 Technical Details tc4 Burst Information Current and Archives tc5 Search Engine tc6 Miscellaneous The Very Brief Description GCN is a system that 1 distributes locations of GRBs detected by spacecraft some in real time while the burst is still bursting and others are delayed due to telemetry down link delays 2 distributes reports follow up observations made by ground based optical and radio observers These two functions provide a one stop shopping network for follow up sites and GRB researchers The GCN used to be called BACODINE system can be explored using the links below We have provided a number of Introductions from different points of view Technical Details describes the various services and products of GCN and how they are generated Several Burst Data Archives are available which record the inputs and outputs of GCN automatically and are updated in real time There is also a search engine and some miscelaneous items Introductions brief describe html A Brief Description There are two parts to the GRB Coordinates Network GCN 1 the real time near real time distribution of GRB locations detected by various spacecraft HETE INTEGRAL IPN etc and 2 the
