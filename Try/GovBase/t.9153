Brokers E Newsletter Upcoming Developments OIC Input on Living Trust Mills The OIC is concerned that some insurance agents are marketing living trust programs and that such trusts are being executed by consumers without the help and advice of qualified attorneys As noted by the state Attorney General an insurance agent s license does not qualify the holder to become involved in such activity Agents are advised that they may jeopardize their insurance licenses by acting in an untrustworthy or incompetent manner as to such programs Please read the following letter for more details Living Trust Warning Following is a letter dated Sept 18 2003 from Sharon Nelson Division Chief of the Consumer Protection Division of the State Attorney General s Office concerning Living Trust Mills Dear Senior Center Director I am writing to alert you to a deceptive practice that targets senior citizens in Washington State known as the Living Trust Mill These scams employ insurance agents to aggressively market living trusts to seniors These companies misrepresent what happens to heirs in probate and use the sale of the living trust to learn about the seniors assets with the goal of selling them high commission investments that are often inappropriate for the consumer In the Living Trust Mill scam salespeople frequently use information designed to frighten consumers about probate in order to encourage the sale of the living trust These salespeople often cite facts that do not pertain to probate laws in Washington State and claim that without the living trust the consumer s heirs will receive nothing or be subjected to substantial inconvenience or embarrassment They often use examples of famous estates that were depleted by probate not relevant to Washington consumers Only licensed Washington attorneys are authorized by law to give legal advice and draw up trust documents on behalf of consumers in this state In the typical living trust scam the consumer has minimal contact if any with a licensed attorney A consumer purchasing a trust with little or no contact with an attorney generally receives a boilerplate form that may not properly settle his or her estate Licensed attorneys are prohibited by ethics rules from sharing or splitting fees with non attorneys so an ethical attorney would not participate in a scheme to allow insurance salespeople to be paid for selling trust documents created by that attorney Currently some of these living trust salespeople are offering to present estate planning or financial planning seminars in senior centers and then scheduling in home appointments to sell the living trusts and investments Please be selective in who you allow to make presentations at your center and do not allow Living Trust Mills access to seniors through your facility We also recommend that consumers seek the advice of an estate planning attorney licensed in Washington to determine the type of estate planning document that is best for them or to make presentations on legal tools for estate planning Consumers who have a complaint regarding living trust sales can contact the Attorney General s Consumer Protection Division at 1 800 551 4636 Please feel free to pass this information on to seniors who visit your center Public Disclosure Sometime during the 4th quarter we anticipate having new Life Expectancy Tables In the meantime the current tables can be found at http www insurance wa gov consumers life lifex table asp http www insurance wa gov consumers life lifex table asp Pending Legislation Insurance Commissioner Kreidler s office is finalizing its legislative agenda for the 2004 legislative session Again leading the list is a proposal to permit the creation of joint underwriting associations for liability markets that have collapsed Bill Daley Kreidler s Policy and Legislative Affairs Deputy indicated that the liability markets had continued to harden and were causing considerable stress in social service medical malpractice adult family home and construction specialty markets In addition the OIC intends to continue pursuing restrictions on corporate owned life insurance legislation that passed the House in 2003 but failed in the Senate Also under consideration are bills to regulate information agencies like CLUE Comprehensive Loss Underwriting Exchange and to require companies that use credit scoring to place customers in different subsidiary companies to file their methodologies with the state OIC Intervention Services Save Consumers Money A 3rd quarter news release praised the effectiveness of the

Rental Car Regulation Last quarter under Upcoming Developments we talked briefly about proposed rules to establish the process and fees for licensure of rental car companies and their agents Currently the general structure of the regulation is written and ready We sent a survey to car rental companies licensed by D epartment of Licensing in an attempt to get a handle on whom and what may be impacted by this legislation The survey was due back in mid September and following a review of those results we may or may not need to tweak the regulation as it now reads Either way we expect some
