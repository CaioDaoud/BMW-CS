Frequently Asked Questions Frequently Asked Questions Work in progress What do I have to do to join the GCN system to get notified of GRB Go see the invitation html Open Invitation page Why did my Socket method packet arrive at T 10sec when I was lead to believe that the GCN system response time was 3 5 5 5 seconds explain the trig to enough searching for enough initial counts scanning it looks for up to 10 sec after the trigger to find a 1 sec interval with enough source counts above background to be able to make a meaningful calculation solution Why didn t I get a notice for GRB NNNNNN mention the various filters and how they reject certain notices to a given site mention the source dis enable flags filters Why is there a newline character at the end of a Socket method packet mention the original socket site had a firewall machine that required it and it just stayed as part of the formal format after it was no longer necessary because it was too much trouble to change the format Why does it go for long stretches many days with continous operations and then in a short amount of time 1 3 hours there are many restarts cause i m installing and testing a new version one restart would be enough if the new feature worked properly but since it often doesn t I have to restart I do pre install testing but some of the last little bits require the real system Also I try to do the restarts during TM drop outs or HV off sessions because there can t be any triggers during these periods so nothing is lost What does MAXBC stand for This is an acronym for the MAXimum Burst Channels The BATSE on board flight software monitors the rates in the 8 LADs in the C1 DISCLA channel and the C2 C3 DISCLA channels C2 C3 are the burst channels for up to 10 minutes after a trigger looking for and recording the maximum peak values After the 10 minutes these 16 rates are telemetered to the ground GCN uses them to produce the MAXBC GRB locations What are the 16 numbers at the end of the MAXBC Notice Those are the peak count rates in a 64 msec interval for the 8 LADs in the lower C1 channel and the burst channels Why does the MAXBC Intensity differ from the Original Notice Intensity Can be higher because of the 64msec vs 1024msec sampling of the rates and it can be lower because the Original Notice can be from two 1 sec samples instead of the normalized single 1 sec sample scale And of course the Final Notices integrate the light curve up for 2 32 sec after the initial trigger so they list a fluence instead of an intensity Why does the Trigger type Identification sometimes change between the type listed in the Original Notice and the Final Notice The algorithm used int he program to determine the trigger makes tests in a 5 dimensional phase space using the count rates available at the time of each notice The counts rates actually integrated fluences are different for the Original and Final Notices so the result of the tests can be different The algorith is about 98 accurate so it will be wrong 2 of the time Why are the roundtrip travel times for GRB packets longer than those for the Imalive packets It is not real they have the same intrinsic travel times it s just that the program is forced due to minimizing the delay times for the e mail recipients to measure the times differently Where can I get the T90 times for bursts In the Cmnt column of the Recent Triggers web page What is the purpose of the Test Notices Sites can exercise their systems instruments an end to end test Their ops programs can treat these Test Notices exactly like real GRB notices but they always have a type ID that is distinguishable from the real notices and the locations and times are knowable Why does the e mail come from a person called vxw The custom front end computers that process the raw telemetry stream are programmed using the VxWorks Inc software development product To use this product within the PACOR division it was necessary to create a psuedo person account under the name of vxw The programs must also be run under this account hense all the e mail comes from this vxw account As an attempt to let people know who this e mail is actually from we added the string BACODINE to the Fullname field in the vxw entry in the etc passwd file we have BACODINE is an odd sounding name how did it come about Yes BACODINE does have a sort of pharmaceutical sound to it I was being pressed to give the project a name so that it could be written up in some monthly status reports When I listed the words BATSE coordinates distribution and then network I realized that BCDN could not be pronounced because it had no vowels So then I started out by doubling up the letters from BATSE but that still was not pronouncable Then came a doubling from coordinates and then it immediately leaped to using the first two letters from the four words that had some relation to what was actually going on in the project I realize that this is not the standard acronymn convention but I don think that is important gcn main html Return to GCN BACODINE homepage This file was last modified on 19 Jul 97
