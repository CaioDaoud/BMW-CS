MISSION Deep Impact will be the first mission to make a spectacular football stadium sized crater seven to 15 stories deep into the speeding comet Dramatic images from both the flyby spacecraft and the impactor will be sent back to distant Earth as data in near realtime These first ever views deep beneath a comet s surface and additional scientific measurements will provide clues to the formation of the solar system Amateur astronomers will combine efforts with astronomers at larger telescopes to offer the public an earth based look at this incredible July 2005 encounter with a comet
