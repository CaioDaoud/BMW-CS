Press Conference by Under Secretary of State Marc Grossman Escudo E U U S Embassy in Mexico City BACKGROUND INFORMATION TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRESS CONFERENCE BY UNDER SECRETARY OF STATE FOR POLITICAL AFFAIRS MARC GROSSMAN AT THE MEXICAN SECRETARIAT OF FOREIGN RELATIONS Mexico City Mexico October 28 2003 UNDER SECRETARY GROSSMAN Ladies and gentlemen thank you all for coming this evening My name is Marc Grossman I am the Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs I have the good fortune to represent the United States at this Special Conference on the Security of the Hemisphere Before I do anything else let me first of all thank our Mexican host President Fox and his government for hosting this conference And I also want to offer our sincere condolences to the families of the two Mexican nationals who died in the forest fires that Mexico and the united States have been fighting in California and also in Mexico I also want to thank all of the people at the Organization of American States Secretary General Gaviria all of the people who have worked so hard in this conference specially to Ambassador John Maisto our Permanent Representative to the Organization of American States for the very important job you have performed today and in recent months I also want to thank our U S mission in Mexico so ably led by Ambassador Garza and all of the people Washington from the may agencies who helped us achieve this very important goal If I could just draw your attention for a moment to the three documents all very important documents that were issued by this meeting The first document as you have seen is a statement on Central America and a Central America democratic security model Like all the documents I think it s very much worth your time First because it s a celebration of the great changes that have occurred in Central America these past ten or fifteen years And Central Americans are now leaders in this hemisphere in thinking new ways about security and thinking about democratic security The second reason it s important is that this is a statement by Central Americans of their own plan on how to move forward on democratic security and we were very glad to support this statement And finally we feel that by bringing this statement here to this meeting it focuses on the need for implementation which is something I know that we and the Central Americans very much wish to pursue The second document that was issued today is a declaration on the situation in Colombia And I again urge you to read it carefully The 33 countries not Colombia who are here today stirred in absolute solidarity with Colombia and the Colombian people s attempt to bring democratic security to their country As you know the United States is a strong supporter of Colombia s efforts to deal with the questions of narco terrorism to deal with the questions of human rights to deal with the questions of peace and prosperity in Colombia And we were also very proud to support this declaration And the third declaration is on the security in the Americas And I know that it s long and I know that it s complicated but I hope that as you write your stories you will be able to take a look at this document because I think it s extremely important It s important because it talks about the new ways of thinking about security in the hemisphere the new threats to security the new ways to answer those threats And I draw your attention for example to page 4 where it talks about the security and the states in the hemisphere is affected in different ways by different threats and it lists them terrorism poverty social exclusion natural and man made disasters HIV AIDS and other diseases trafficking in persons attacks on cyber security the potential for damage arising from accidents the possibility of weapons of mass destruction And I think that what this declaration has done is begin to talk in very concrete terms about what it is we need to accomplish in this Hemisphere together in a multilateral way to create security for the Hemisphere Two interesting things that struck me in listening to the speeches and having bilaterals that I ve had over the last couple of days First so many of the speakers talked about the importance of people in the Hemisphere to think about issues like poverty and social exclusion and fighting HIV AIDS and other diseases And I have the sense sometimes that people felt that the United States would be on the other side of the argument and what I ve tried to do in my statement today and we have tried to do in this whole process is to show that we also believe in this multi dimensional answer to the question of what security means for the hemisphere And the second thing I would like to emphasize is the point that President Fox made at the end of his closing statement this evening a very important point about what the purpose of all of this is And the purpose of all of this is to promote and protect the rights and dignity and prosperity of individuals And while sometimes you come to these conferences and they are about theory and they are about strategy the most important thing I think about this conference as President Fox said is this declaration is for the protection and promotion of individuals and I think that s very important Obviously the future will tell about how we deal with this document But again on page 6 I think you will see a long series of very specific commitments that the countries of the hemisphere have made They ve made commitments to deal with this multi dimensional threats in a multi dimensional way We ve also made commitments to follow up what we did today by having more and better conference in security building measures Measures like increased transparency in military exercises or more exchanges of information One final point and then I ll stop I think to put this document and this conference into context you have to step back to Quebec in the Spring of 2001 where the hemisphere leaders got together and passed out their goals for democracy and security and prosperity And people worked hard to pursue those goals but I think the lessons among the lessons of the 11th of September 2001 is that all of these goals had to be pursued simultaneously and in a connected way in an integrated way in a multilateral way And that democracy and prosperity and security are all related Democracy makes good neighbors and I think this document here is going to make this hemisphere a group of nations even better neighbors because strong democratic governments by the fundamental basis for the protection as President Fox said of individuals We re proud to have been here we re proud to have participated in this conference we re proud to have participated in the production of these documents and with that I ll be glad to answer any questions anybody has QUESTION My first question will not be related to the security conference but will be related to what happened yesterday at COLMEX El Colegio de Mexico A few minutes ago Foreign Relations Secretary Derbez said that he had talked to you about the statements made by Mr Noriega yesterday about the political games so to speak Mr Derbez stressed that Mexico wasn t satisfied with this kind of statement That would be my first question and my second question would be why did the U S expressed doubts about the paragraphs that speak about land mines and climate change Was it because of the Ottawa Conference and the Kyoto Protocol UNDER SECRETARY GROSSMAN Thank you very much for both those questions First let me just describe what happened this afternoon At the end of the meeting as we were getting ready to leave foreign Minister Derbez did come up to me and said that he had some concerns about what he had read in the press here in Mexico that reported on statements that Ambassador Noriega had made And he said that this was a challenge for him and that he hope that nothing like that had been said We offered to Foreign Minister Derbez the text of what Ambassador Noriega had said and I understand he offered that to you and actually read from it in his press conference And on the question of playing games all I can tell you is the relationship between the United States and Mexico is among the most important relationships that the United States has Mexico matters to the United States of America And the U S Mexican relationship is too important to have games played with it and we would not participate in such a thing and I can t imagine that the Mexican government would participate in such a thing As to your second question we did take reservations on two of the paragraphs and as you say the reason is that our policy towards those two paragraphs is different than everyone else s We did agree to the 52 other paragraphs but on those two we felt that we needed to say something different And I think in both cases the footnotes speak for themselves QUESTION translation from Spanish This morning you said that it would be in the interest of the U S to have a more effective OAS with new tools What do you mean by this request from the U S Does it have to do with the operational characteristic that you are planning to give to the Inter American Defense Organization My second question is if Mexico s leaving the Rio Treaty has had or will have any consequence regarding the fight against terrorism UNDER SECRETARY GROSSMAN I believe that many of the organizations that were established after the Second World War are either now revitalizing themselves or going out of business And I believe that the OAS is going to be one of those organizations which will adapt will revitalize and will stay very much in business And that is thanks to our Ambassador thanks to Secretary General Gaviria and to the commitment of people around the hemisphere to the OAS I can tell you that the OAS s invocation of the Rio Treaty on the 11th of September 2001 was a great addition to the solidarity that individual countries had expressed to the United States And that the OAS as a group had said that this terrible attack was something worth thinking about in a collective way it was very very important So when I start my answer to your question sir by saying that I believe the OAS already is much more effective that it has been over many years but certainly in the last couple of years why do I say that I say that because we had the Quebec summit we got together in Santiago we got together in Bridgetown and if you look at this document and I ask you please to read it from top to bottom I think what you will see here is a path forward for what could be a very effective for what will be a very effective organization So I don t have any doubts in that regard I ll give one specific example if as called for in this document the OAS takes a leadership role in this hemisphere which I believe it will in confidence and security building measures that s a huge accomplishment And I know that the Permanent Council will be taking this up And there are a list of 50 60 of these measures that are ready to go So if a year from now we are all together and the conversation is did the OAS move forward on these confidence and security building measures And the OAS has done so I think that in that particular case it will be more effective But you can see it everywhere the committee on combating terrorism committees on money laundering the work that is done by the OAS on human rights by example the work that the OAS has done recently in Haiti with Ambassador Todman All of those I believe show an increased effort on the part of the OAS As to the last part of your question I m not sure I understood it but all I can tell you is nothing that I have seen or been involved in the last couple of years has made it more complicated for anybody to fight terrorism Fighting terrorism I think is a common theme in the hemisphere QUESTION President Bush just told President Fox that they are going to reopen talks on immigration issues But immigration after what happened on September 11 and the war against terrorism immigration is now considered a big internal security issue for the United States How does the United States intend to treat address immigration with the Mexican government under this light UNDER SECRETARY GROSSMAN Thank you very much First we recognize the great importance of this issue to the government and to the people of Mexico And so the specific answer to your question is we are going to treat this very seriously because it is a serious issue on the part of Mexico I think as you said in your statement in your question the 11th of September does have an impact here and we shouldn t ignore it But since the 11th of September we have pursued a policy in the United States of what we call open doors but secure borders And we believe that it is well within the capacity of the United States to have the great exchange of people that we have from around the world and have secure borders And so the specific question regarding Mexico I think President Bush has laid out four very important points here that ought to guide the conversation about immigration And that is that immigration should be safe humane orderly and legal And I know when Foreign Minister Derbez comes to Washington on the 12th of September to visit with Secretary Powell in the Binational Commission meeting there is a committee that works on immigration and I m sure they will take this up seriously QUESTION inaudible The OAS has played an important role in Venezuela recently getting the two sides together what role do you think is possible for the OAS to play in Colombia the country has been challenged by civil war for almost 40 years now UNDER SECRETARY GROSSMAN A fair question I think that the statement today is a very important indication of what it is the OAS can do And don t forget it s not the first one after the Nogal bombing last year the OAS also came to Colombia s strong defense I the OAS and I believe the OAS will takes this document seriously a great deal of it will apply to Colombia The other thing the document talks about today is giving support to Colombia as it moves forward in its peace process support to Colombia as it moves forward in its peace process support to Colombia in the days we hope when there is going to be reintegration and disarmament and it calls on the international organizations to help out in that way and there maybe a role for the OAS I think as you seat here tonight it s hard to give a specific one two three but I think the document does a very good job in laying out what s possible Thank you very much epress html Press Menu Press Office Tel 5080 2000 ext 2253 Fax
