prohibited and punishable under Federal Law Introduction Overview Splash Image One of the most important ecological issues concerning our planet is climate change It is generally agreed that the Earth s climate will modify in response to radiative forcing induced by changes in atmospheric trace gases cloud cover cloud type solar radiation and tropospheric aerosols liquid or solid particles suspended in the air In order to develop conceptual and predictive global climate models it is vital to monitor these properties Two MODIS Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer instruments the first launched on 18 December 1999 onboard the Terra Platform and the second on 4 May 2002 onboard the Aqua platform are uniquely designed wide spectral range high spatial resolution and near daily global coverage to observe and monitor these and other Earth changes index intro html MORE Feature L1B Granule Image IMAGES MOD02 GRANULE 2003 09 11 254 1415 rgb143 jpg Click for expanded view Isabel Powerful Catagory 5 Hurricane On September 11th 2003 the Terra MODIS instrument captured this image of extremely dangerous Hurricane Isabel in the western Atlantic moving slowly but steadily towards the U S In this image the center of Isabel was located about 300 miles east northeast of the northern Leeward Islands With maximum sustained winds of 160 mph and gusts to 195 mph Isabel is a Category 5 hurricane on the Saffir Simpson hurricane scale Isabel is the first Category 5 hurricane in the Atlantic Basin since Hurricane Mitch in 1998 Image by Ridgway Gray Hubanks NASA GSFC More RGB images

expanded view L1B RGB Composite The RGB MODIS bands 1 4 3 true color composite for a single daytime granule of Terra MODIS data over the Western Pacific Ocean near the Kamchatka Peninsula 0025 UTC on 10 August 2001 shows extensive cloud cover over the Sea of Okhotsk including mid level and upper level ice clouds whereas the Bering Sea to the east of the Peninsula contains extensive marine stratocumulus clouds with numerous ship tracks in the southeastern portion of the image images Kamchatka jpg Cloud Optical Thickness click for expanded view Cloud Optical Thickness Cloud optical thickness at 0 66 m derived for this granule shows optically thick values up to 25 marine stratocumulus to the east of the Peninsula and identifies them as liquid water clouds The optically thick ice clouds over the Sea of Okhotsk and around the southern portion of the Kamchatka Peninsula have cloud optical thicknesses approaching 40 Note that two separate color bars were implemented to help visually differentiate clouds identified as ice violet green vs liquid water yellow red both scales cover the range 1 75 images Kamchatka jpg Cloud Top Pressure click for expanded view Cloud Top Pressure Cloud top pressures derived for all cloud filled pixels in the scene clearly show that liquid water clouds lie predominantly between 700 and 850 hPa whereas the optically thick ice clouds over the Sea of Okhotsk lie at altitudes above the 500 hPa level Note that the scale used in the image ranges from 300 hPa violet to 1000 hPa red images Kamchatka jpg Cloud Effective Radius click for expanded view Cloud Effective Radius This image shows cloud effective particle radius derived for cloudy pixels in the scene Separate color bars were used again here to differentiate cloud phase ice violet green which covers the range 6 50 vs liquid water yellow red which covers the range 2 30 It is noteworthy that the ship tracks are not easily identified in the cloud optical thickness image above but are visible in the cloud effective radius image from the reduced effective radii in the microphysical retrievals For this scene the thermal infrared and decision tree algorithms for deriving cloud thermodynamic phase discussed by docs Platnick et al 2003 pdf Platnick et al are in quite good agreement For more detail see docs King et al 2003a pdf King et al Images by Mark Gray Dr Steven

water clouds from November 2002 through June 2003 are displayed on a log scale to help bring out detail The unit less data values range from 1 0 violet to 10 0 green to 76 0 red Optical thickness is a measure of the quanity of solar radiation allowed to travel through a column of atmosphere and is an important new tool for helping scientists understand the role clouds play in the global climate system Red and yellow regions indicate very cloudy skies on average which reduces the solar radiation reaching the Earth s surface Green and light blue areas show moderately cloudy skies Dark blue to violet colors show regions where there is little or no cloud cover on average and low attenuation of solar radiation from clouds Animations by Paul Hubanks A complete set of monthly global atmosphere
