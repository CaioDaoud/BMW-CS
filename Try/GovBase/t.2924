The Jazznet Project JazzNet Charlie Parker Sonny Rollins What is JazzNet JazzNet is a dedicated cluster of personal computers PCs used for applied mathematics and scientific computations at the National Institute of Standards and Technology NIST This resource is used as a personal supercomputer to carry out computational tasks too large for conventional workstations The PC cluster is dubbed JazzNet because its nodes are named after great Jazz artists Miles Davis Ella Fitzgerald and so on Built using off the shelf components Intel Pentium II motherboards Linux Fast Ethernet it can achieve multi Gflop performance for around 15K But more importantly on real applications it competes surprisingly well with systems costing 10 100 times more Because the system is inexpensive about the cost of a high end workstation it can be used as a personal supercomputer rather than a resource that must be shared by many people We use JazzNet both to distribute sequential jobs for increased throughput and also as a parallel processing environment using PVM and MPI include spcmp txt overview html Overview performance html Performance applications html Applications hardware html Hardware software html Software related html Related Sites credits html Credits Miles Davis Ella Fitzgerald Dizzy Gillespie http math nist gov RPozo Roldan Pozo Photos Bob Parent Photo Archive
