medical care should be offered It is a method of comparing the cost and effectiveness of two or more alternatives Such comparisons are most useful when one of the alternatives being considered is standard care as this allows the decision maker to consider whether an innovation is better than the status quo When one of the alternatives saves costs and improves outcomes it is favored this principle is called dominance The dominance principle can favor the innovation or standard care When one of the alternatives is more costly and yields better outcomes dominance provides no guidance The decision maker will approve of its adoption only if the additional effectiveness justifies its additional cost This is a value decision the cost effectiveness analyst must determine the value of the outcomes that are achieved First the incremental cost effectiveness ratio is found This ratio is simply the change in cost divided by the change in outcome To find this ratio a single dimensional effectiveness measure is required The ratio is evaluated against a threshold criteria for what constitutes a cost effective intervention To facilitate the comparison of different interventions a standard method of cost effectiveness analysis was developed by a task force of experts organized by the U S Public Health Service PHS Gold Siegel Russell Weinstein 1996 The Task Force recommended that cost effectiveness studies use the Quality Adjusted Life Year QALY as the outcome measure acknowledging the widespread use of this measure in healthcare The QALY is an outcome measure that reflects both the quantity and the quality of life Torrance Feeny 1989 Quality of life adjustments are based on patient or societal ratings of the quality of life associated with different health states The ratings also known as preferences or utilities are on a scale of zero representing death to one representing perfect health There are several methods for obtaining these ratings The Time Trade Off method asks the individual doing the rating how much healthy life they are willing to give up to be cured of the condition The Standard Gamble method asks them how much of a risk of death they are willing to incur in order to be cured of the condition The cost effectiveness ratio represents a measure of how efficiently the proposed intervention can produce an additional QALY By using this standard method the cost effectiveness of alternative innovations may be compared helping healthcare payers decide what changes they should adopt The PHS Task Force did not recommend a standard of what constitutes a cost effective intervention that is how low the cost effectiveness ratio must be for an intervention to be adopted Others have observed that the U S healthcare system adopts treatments that cost less than 50 000 per quality adjusted life year Owens 1998 The goal of the decision maker is to adopt all interventions that represent efficient ways of producing QALYs and to disapprove of interventions with ratios that are too high The PHS Task Force made other recommendations on how a cost effectiveness analysis should be conducted Costs should be estimated from society s perspective The effects of an intervention on all cost should be considered not only the direct cost of the intervention but its effect on healthcare expenditures and costs incurred by patients Costs and benefits should be discounted at a 3 annual rate When the effect of the intervention on costs and benefits are not fully realized during the study period modeling should be used to estimate the costs and benefits over the patient s life time The task force also described methods of estimating the statistical significance of cost effectiveness findings Note that when cost effectiveness is a primary study hypothesis variance in costs and outcomes and their covariance will affect the sample size For details regarding these issues the cost effectiveness analyst will want to consult the recommendations of the U S Public Health Service panel on cost effectiveness in health and medicine http www oup usa org docs 0195108248 html Gold et al 1996 References Gold M R Siegel J E Russell L B
