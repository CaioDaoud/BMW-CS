in the forground The illicit transshipment re export and diversion of goods and technologies in international commerce compromise the effectiveness of U S trade agreements and export control laws In so doing such illicit transshipments harm U S industry threaten U S security weaken confidence in the international trading regime and undermine international efforts to liberalize trade To help combat these threats the Department of Commerce DOC has launched the Transshipment Country Export Control Initiative TECI N 1 End Note One 1 The TECI is a multi faceted cooperative initiative that seeks to strengthen the trade compliance and export control systems of those countries and companies that constitute global transshipment hubs By working to strengthen those systems the DOC seeks to enhance security and confidence in international trade flows The TECI has two principal prongs A government to government prong whereby the DOC works with its counterpart trade and export control agencies in key transshipment countries to a assist them in the adoption of export and transshipment control regimes tailored to their economies b exchange data to facilitate more effective administration of U S and transshipment country trade controls and c encourage them to adopt certain other measures to facilitate better enforcement of U S trade and export control laws A government to private sector prong whereby the DOC works with industry in particular companies involved in the transportation of goods through transshipment country hubs and major consignees and end users of goods located in those hubs to enlist their support in preventing illicit transshipments The TECI seeks to avoid imposing unnecessary costs on industry by coordinating with other agencies to eliminate wasteful duplication of effort and by bringing real security benefits to industry that will enhance legitimate trade Within the DOC the TECI will be coordinated by the Bureau of Industry and Security BIS working with other relevant DOC agencies including the International Trade Administration BIS will also work closely with other relevant U S Government agencies including the Departments of State and Energy and the U S Customs Service and will build on coordinate with and support relevant existing and proposed programs and initiatives including the Export Control and Border Security EXBS
