the CIO Council s Strategic Plan the XML Working Group was charged with developing an online information resource at http xml gov xml gov defining and documenting an evolving strategy and a set of tasks for the effective and well coordinated usage of eXtensible Markup Language XML to support governmental functions The initial deadline for this task was September 30 2001 The CIO Council s Plan was formerly available at http cio gov Documents cio final strategic plan 9 25rev pdf Please note the following conditions and constraints In recognition of the relatively new and dynamic nature of the technology we were asked to develop an evolving strategy Beyond the initial iteration of the plan and set of tasks no further deadlines have been specified nor is completion of the plan contemplated in the sense that no further changes can be anticipated Our strategy is to be defined and documented at xml gov Our Web site is both the embodiment of our strategic plan as well as a primary means of implementing it All of our significant accomplishments should be documented on the site meaning that it also constitutes a record by which to assess the results we have achieved There are no qualifications for participation in the Working Group nor any mandate for anyone to do so The financial resources available to the Working Group are quite limited We are largely reliant upon GSA for financial support Funding for the XML Registry has been included in GSA s http xml gov documents completed xmlitbudget04 htm budget for FY 2004 We are not a policy making body nor were we initially chartered to take on operational responsibilities In our revised charter the CIO Council s Architecture and Infrastructure Committee AIC has instructed us to take a more operational orientation in the sense of identifying specific project task deliverables However it remains to be seen how such potential tasks htm projects and tasks will be prioritized as well as whether resources will be provided to carry them out Thus far funding provided through the CIO Council has been quite limited and while OMB has http www feapmo gov feapmo 004 htm invited agencies to cosponsor the XML registry only one http www nasa gov home index html skipIntro 1 NASA has thus far chosen to do so The AIC s Emerging Technologies Subcommittee has been charged with developing a http xml gov draft etLifeCycle htm process whereby the intormation technology innovation life cycle can be effectively managed on a Governmentwide basis Depending upon how that process shapes up and is implemented it may become the driving force by which our priorities are determined and supported In accordance with OMB Circulars http www whitehouse gov omb circulars a076 a076 html A 76 and http www whitehouse gov omb circulars a119 a119 html A 119 whenever possible agencies should use voluntary consensus standards developed in partnership with commerce and industry XML is a means to an end not an end unto itself Our strategic activities should support the policy initiatives of the Administration including for example the http www whitehouse gov omb inforeg egovstrategy pdf Citizen Centered eGovernment Action Plan and OMB s http www whitehouse gov omb fedreg final information quality guidelines html information quality guidelines Our extended and revised charter expires on September 30 2004 We should not assume that it will be extended and should scope our objectives accordingly while at the same time considering how best to facilitate necessary followup and further value additive activities that may be warranted beyond that date As outlined in our completed charter htm charter our mission is to accelerate facilitate and catalyze the effective and appropriate implementation of
