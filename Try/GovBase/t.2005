MIAMI FL 8 AM EST MON DEC 1 2003 FOR THE NORTH ATLANTIC CARIBBEAN SEA AND THE GULF OF MEXICO THERE WERE 14 NAMED TROPICAL CYCLONES IN THE ATLANTIC BASIN IN 2003 OF WHICH SEVEN BECAME HURRICANES THESE TOTALS COMPARE TO LONG TERM AVERAGES OF 10 NAMED TROPICAL CYCLONES AND SIX HURRICANES THERE HAVE BEEN TWELVE SEASONS WITH 14 OR MORE NAMED TROPICAL CYCLONES IN THE 118 SEASONS SINCE 1886 SO THIS SEASON RANKS IN THE UPPER TENTH PERCENTILE OF SEASONAL NUMBER OF NAMED TROPICAL CYCLONES SEVEN HURRICANES IS CLOSE TO THE LONG TERM AVERAGE VALUE OF SIX BUT BOTH FABIAN AND ISABEL WERE EXCEPTIONALLY LONG LIVED AND INTENSE HURRICANES FABIAN ISABEL AND KATE WERE MAJOR HURRICANES WITH WIND SPEEDS OF 111 MPH OR HIGHER OR CATEGORY THREE OR HIGHER ON THE SAFFIR SIMPSON HURRICANE SCALE IN ADDITION THERE WERE FIVE TROPICAL DEPRESSIONS THAT DID NOT REACH STORM STRENGTH SIX NAMED TROPICAL CYCLONES AFFECTED THE UNITED STATES BRINGING HIGH WINDS STORM SURGE AND OR HEAVY RAIN TROPICAL STORM BILL MADE LANDFALL IN LOUISIANA CLAUDETTE HIT TEXAS AS A CATEGORY ONE HURRICANE NEAR MATAGORDA ISLAND HURRICANE ERIKA MADE LANDFALL IN MEXICO BUT BROUGHT TROPICAL STORM CONDITIONS TO SOUTH TEXAS GRACE MADE LANDFALL IN TEXAS AS A WEAKENING TROPICAL STORM TROPICAL STORM HENRI MADE LANDFALL ON THE CENTRAL FLORIDA GULF COAST AS A TROPICAL DEPRESSION AND ISABEL STRUCK THE MID ATLANTIC COAST WITH CATEGORY TWO HURRICANE CONDITIONS AND WITH RECORD FLOOD WATER LEVELS IN THE UPPER CHESAPEAKE BAY ELSEWHERE JUAN WAS THE WORST HURRICANE TO HIT HALIFAX NOVA SCOTIA IN ITS MODERN HISTORY AND FABIAN WAS THE MOST DESTRUCTIVE HURRICANE TO HIT BERMUDA IN OVER 75 YEARS IN THE CYCLONE SUMMARIES GIVEN BELOW DATES ARE BASED ON UNIVERSAL COORDINATED TIME AND DISTANCES ARE GIVEN IN STATUTE MILES ANA HAS THE DISTINCTION OF BEING THE FIRST ATLANTIC TROPICAL STORM ON RECORD IN THE MONTH OF APRIL IT FORMED AS A SUBTROPICAL CYCLONE ABOUT 250 MILES WEST OF BERMUDA ON 20 APRIL AND SOON BECAME TROPICAL ANA MOVED GENERALLY TOWARD THE EAST ACROSS THE CENTRAL NORTH ATLANTIC WITH MAXIMUM WINDS REACHING 50 MPH BEFORE BECOMING EXTRATROPICAL ON 24 APRIL TWO DEATHS ARE ATTRIBUTED TO ANA WHEN A BOAT CAPSIZED AT JUPITER INLET FLORIDA ON 20 APRIL DUE TO A COMBINATION OF INCOMING SWELLS FROM ANA AND THE OUTGOING TIDE SHORT LIVED TROPICAL DEPRESSION TWO DEVELOPED IN THE TROPICAL ATLANTIC ON 10 JUNE ONLY THE THIRD TROPICAL CYCLONE TO FORM EAST OF THE LESSER ANTILLES IN JUNE SINCE 1967 THE DEPRESSION MOVED QUICKLY WESTWARD AND DEGENERATED INTO A TROPICAL WAVE ONLY ONE DAY AFTER IT FORMED TROPICAL STORM BILL FORMED OVER THE SOUTHERN GULF OF MEXICO ON 29 JUNE FROM THE INTERACTION OF A TROPICAL WAVE WITH AN UPPER LEVEL LOW IT MOVED NORTHWARD AND MADE LANDFALL IN SOUTHEASTERN LOUISIANA WITH WINDS TO 60 MPH LATE ON THE NEXT DAY BILL PRODUCED AT LEAST FIVE TORNADOES COASTAL FLOODING AND HEAVY RAIN ONE TORNADO STRUCK RESERVE LOUISIANA DAMAGING 20 MOBILE HOMES AND INJURING FOUR PERSONS BILL WAS ABSORBED
