significant legal or policy determinations and are designed to guide an Administrative Law Judge in deciding cases involving the Department of Social Services Community Care Licensing Division The authority to establish precedent for administrative matters by identifying cases and certifying them was established fairly recently although precedent is used routinely by judges in other civil cases and in criminal cases The Department first adopted a number of decisions as precedent in May of 1999 Precedent is important to parties in a legal case involving the Department because the precedent establishes what the Department has done in the past and why The procedures that apply to an administrative case are in the Administrative Procedures Act and are more fully described by the Office of Administrative Hearings which assigns judges to make the decisions in the cases http www oah dgs ca gov default htm http www oah dgs ca gov default htm This link will provide you with general information on the procedure including information designed to assist the person representing themselves In what type of cases does the Department s precedent apply The precedent applies to cases involving the Department of Social Services an operator or applicant for a care facility or an individual who resides in works in or is present in a care facility Each of the decisions which altogether constitute the precedent are cases involving a care facility regulated by the Department of Social Services Community Care Licensing Division If someone is unclear as to whether a particular decision certified as precedent applies to their case they should present it to the Administrative Law Judge before or during the administrative hearing Precedent is binding upon any case filed by the Department to the extent that a case involves the same facts legal or policy issues determined in the precedent How is a decision which is relied upon as precedent used The Administrative Law Judge is required to apply the principles of the Department s precedent to the extent that the facts and issues are the same The judge s final decision must be consistent with the precedential decisions An attorney for the Department may in an administrative case bring one or more of the decisions to the Administrative Law Judge s attention when it appears that the facts and other issues are the same or similar If you are a respondent in a case involving the Department s Community Care Licensing Division and you believe that one or more of the decisions which the department identified
