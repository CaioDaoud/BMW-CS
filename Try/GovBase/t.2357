E Webb NASA administrator from 1961 1968 James E Webb Space Telescope The Legend Behind the Name Portrait of James E Webb The man whose name NASA has chosen to bestow upon the successor to the Hubble Space Telescope is most commonly linked to the Apollo moon program not to science Yet many believe that James E Webb who ran the fledgling space agency from February 1961 to October 1968 did more for science than perhaps any other government official and that it is only fitting that the Next Generation Space Telescope would be named after him A Balanced Program Webb s record of support for space science would support those views Although President John Kennedy had committed the nation to landing a man on the moon before the end of the decade Webb believed that the space program was more than a political race He believed that NASA had to strike a balance between human space flight and science because such a combination would serve as a catalyst for strengthening the nation s universities and aerospace industry As part of an oral history project sponsored by the LBJ Library in Austin Texas Webb recalled his conversations with Kennedy and Vice President Lyndon Johnson As far as he was concerned he was quoted as saying in one transcript I m not going to run a program that s just a one shot program If you want me to be the administrator it s going to be a balanced program And so far as I m concerned I m not going to run a program that s just a one shot program If you want me to be the administrator it s going to be a balanced program that does the job for the country that I think has got to be done under the policies of the 1958 Act James E Webb Webb s vision of a balanced program resulted in a decade of space science research that remains unparalleled today During his tenure NASA invested in the development of robotic spacecraft which explored the lunar environment so that astronauts could do so later and it sent scientific probes to Mars and Venus giving Americans their first ever view of the strange landscape of outer space As early as 1965 Webb also had written that a major space telescope then known as the Large Space Telescope should become a major NASA effort By the time Webb retired just a few months before the first moon landing in July 1969 NASA had launched more than 75 space science missions to study the stars and galaxies our own Sun and the as yet unknown environment of space above the Earth s atmosphere Missions such as the http rosat gsfc nasa gov docs heasarc missions oso1 html Orbiting Solar Observatory and the http heasarc gsfc nasa gov docs heasarc missions explorer11 html Explorer series of astronomical satellites built the foundation for the most successful period of astronomical discovery in history which continues today Webb supported science behind the scenes as well Shortly after assuming the job vacated by Keith Glennan Webb chose to continue the same basic organization that his predecessor had adopted for the selection of science programs However he enhanced the role of scientists in key ways He gave them greater control in the selection process of science missions and he created the NASA University Program which established grants for space research funded the construction of new laboratories at universities and provided fellowships for graduate students The program also encouraged university presidents and vice presidents to actively participate in NASA s Space Science Program and to publicly support all of NASA s programs A Notable Record This record of accomplishment is perhaps more notable given Webb s initial reluctance to accept the job An experienced manager attorney and businessman the North Carolina native had served as Director of the Bureau of the Budget and as Undersecretary of State in the Truman administration Webb also served as president and vice president of several private firms and served on the board of directors of the McDonnell Aircraft Company He was not however a scientist or engineer something he noted when President Kennedy asked him to consider the job as NASA Administrator He told an interviewer that I felt that I had made the pattern of my life and I was not really the best person for this anyway It seemed to me someone who knew more about rocketry about space would be a better person Kennedy did not see it that way With his keen political savvy and exceptional managerial skills Webb was perfect for the job the President believed He made it clear to Webb that the NASA Administrator s job was a policy job He needed someone who could handle the large issues of national and international policies The scientific community was equally anxious about Webb The scientists at NASA Headquarters had wanted someone with a keen interest in space science and a desire to bolster the involvement of universities in the space program Within a few months Webb proved where he stood A Fitting Honor At the height of the Apollo program NASA had 35 000 employees and more than 400 000 contractors in thousands of companies and universities across the U S Under Webb s direction the agency undertook one of the most impressive projects in history landing a man on the moon before the end of the decade As NASA Administrator Sean O Keefe said when he announced the new name for the next generation space telescope It is fitting that Hubble s successor be named in honor of James Webb Thanks to his efforts we got our first glimpses at the dramatic landscape of outer space He took our nation on its first voyages of exploration turning our imagination into reality Indeed he laid the foundations at NASA for one of the most successful periods of astronomical discovery As a result we re rewriting the textbooks today with the help of the
