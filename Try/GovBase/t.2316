tool for U S Fish and Wildlife Service USGS Presents Swan Research The Upper Mississippi River UMR has become an important stopover area for the Eastern population of tundra swans during fall migration in recent years During 1997 through 2002 annual fall swan use averaged more than 760 000 use days This represents a 700 increase in river wide swan use from the early 1980s Because of the increased public interest in swans and the responsibility for management of the UMR for this trust species river managers and biologists have identified and prioritized research needs that would provide important information to support the wise management of tundra swans Federal and state partners are working to expand efforts to address these research areas USGS scientist Kevin Kenow gave a presentation on Tundra Swan Research Needs on the Upper Mississippi River at the 19th Trumpeter Swan Society Conference in Richmond British Columbia on February 5 staff bios kpk0 html Kevin Kenow La Crosse WI 608 781 6278 kevin kenow usgs gov USGS Publishes Loon Findings The common loon a long lived species is considered sensitive to the toxic effects of mercury Loons feed high on the food chain primarily on fish and as such are at the greatest risk of mercury exposure among wildlife species within North American freshwater aquatic systems USGS in collaboration with the state of Wisconsin recently developed a model for the bioaccumulation of mercury in loon chicks that could be compared to other data on the effects of mercury exposure The study used doubly labeled water to determine the daily energy expenditure of common loon chicks at 10 21 and 35 days old Study results provided estimates of food consumption and corresponding intake of methyl mercury USGS scientist Kevin Kenow is a coauthor on a paper recently published in The Auk Daily energy expenditures of free ranging Common Loon Gavia immer chicks by F Fournier W H Karasov M W Meyer and K P Kenow staff bios kpk0 html Kevin Kenow La Crosse WI 608 781 6278 kevin kenow usgs gov USGS represented at national aquaculture meetings Aquaculture represents a multi billion dollar impact on the U S economy The U S Department of Agriculture Joint Subcommittee on Aquaculture s JSA Working Group on Quality Assurance in Aquaculture and Aquaculture Effluent Task Force two groups that are key to U S aquaculture s continued growth will meet in conjunction with the Aquaculture America meeting in Louisville Kentucky February 17 21 USGS scientists Guy Stehly and Mark Gaikowski from USGS Upper Midwest Environmental Sciences Center will participate in both JSA meetings to help develop a five year plan for developing aquaculture drugs and to work with the U S Environmental Protection Agency to develop environmental guidelines for aquaculture effluents They will also present their work on several priority aquaculture drugs at the Aquaculture America meeting staff bios mpg0 html Mark Gaikowski La Crosse Wisconsin 608 781 6284 mark gaikowski usgs gov USGS and pharmaceutical company collaborate to develop new drug for aquaculture Schering Plough Animal Health Corporation came closer to gaining Food and Drug Administration FDA approval of a new oral drug to control a major systemic disease of channel catfish The FDA s Center for Veterinary Medicine recently accepted a comprehensive study to demonstrate the safety of a new oral drug florfenicol in channel catfish Working within a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement with Schering Plough USGS scientists at the Upper Midwest Environmental Sciences Center successfully designed and conducted the study Approval of the new drug will help the channel catfish industry a major employer in the southeast to control disease outbreaks which cause significant production losses annually to the 4 billion industry staff bios mpg0 html Mark Gaikowski La Crosse Wisconsin 608 781 6284 mark gaikowski usgs gov USGS presents research at Wildlife Society meeting Many federal state and private agencies are involved in various planning efforts for bird conservation on lands under their management USGS research wildlife biologists from the Upper Midwest Environmental Sciences Center UMESC will be presenting results of their research at a joint meeting of the Wisconsin Iowa and Illinois Chapters of The Wildlife Society in Dubuque Iowa on February 26th Their presentation topics will focus on regional bird conservation in the Midwest and on the implementation and results of a water level manipulation project on a section of the Mississippi River UMESC biologists are supporting bird conservation efforts by assessing the effectiveness of habitat management activities integrating relevant ecological information and developing GIS based habitat association models staff bios kpk0 html Kevin Kenow La Crosse WI 608 781 6278 kevin kenow usgs gov USGS develops decision support tool for U S Fish and Wildlife Service USGS Upper Midwest Environmental Sciences Center researchers have developed a decision support tool to evaluate the availability of waterfowl forage for the Upper Mississippi River and will use this tool to assist the Fish and Wildlife Service in a public meeting on March 4 Areas that have been identified since 1957 as critical resting and feeding areas for migratory waterfowl and thus closed to hunting will be reevaluated to ensure that management goals are being met The USGS tool will be used to identify changes that have occurred in the distribution of critical food resources Such changes may lead the Service to propose changes in its historical Waterfowl Closed Areas as part of their Comprehensive Conservation Planning process now under way staff bios kpk0 html Kevin Kenow La Crosse WI 608 781
