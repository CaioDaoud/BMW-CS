law also prohibits dental personnel from performing any service which they are not competent to perform or which is not in accordance with customs and standards of the dental profession as provided in Section 1684 of the Dental Practice Act 1684 In addition to other acts constituting unprofessional conduct under this chapter it is unprofessional conduct for a person licensed under this chapter to
