could get that that would be useful Also you said yesterday the President and others were going to be calling around the Hill on trade promotion authority I d be interested to know whether that s happened whether the President has indicated particularly to Republicans whether he s ready at this point to sign something that includes some trade adjustment assistance and if you could define a little bit of that And if this doesn t happen this week what damage is done since there s nothing that is being negotiated right now that leads MR FLEISCHER There are three main areas that the Congress is working on this week where the President has called on the President to act And keep in mind that the House of Representatives is leaving at the end of this week and won t be back until the end of September And then they have a very abbreviated session this fall before the Congress leaves to campaign for reelection The Senate is scheduled to leave a week from Friday So time is running out on this Congress and there are three major issues that are pending in the Congress where the President wants to work with the Congress to help them complete action this week One is on trade promotion authority which can the President believes be resolved this week in a conference committee so final action can be taken and then a bill can be signed this August The second issue is corporate corruption as I discussed earlier And the President again sees the House bill and the Senate bill both of which are tough which can easily be brought together and presented to the President for signature The third issue in which the Congress has been moving forward rather at a strong pace is a legislation to create a Cabinet level department of homeland security All three of those the President is looking for action this week On trade promotion authority and on corporate corruption final action sending a bill to the President On homeland security House passage and then next week Senate passage The risk of inaction is you don t have to be a helicopter pilot to know that Congress is heading for a giant traffic jam Congress has a lot of unfinished business left on its agenda and if Congress fails to pass trade promotion authority this week or it fails to pass the corporate corruption initiative this week or if it s unable to have initial passage of homeland security it s presenting itself with a gigantic traffic jam which is hard to get out of this September and for the shortened session they have before they leave The other items that are pending in Congress that they hope to come back to when they return in September are a patient bill of rights which is still stuck in the House Senate conference committee legislation to make America more energy independent which is still stuck in the H Senate conference committee faith based legislation welfare reform a ban on cloning The Senate has yet to even pass a budget And of course they also have all 13 appropriation bills to get through So from a very practical point of view if the Congress is not able to get it done this week it does endanger the possibility of getting it done at all because the roads will be too crowded and clogged to get anything to its final destination Q And on the specific question of trade adjustment assistance which the differences don t seem all that MR FLEISCHER Trade adjustment assistance is an issue where the President does support trade adjustment assistance It s part of the budget that he sent up to the Hill There is a conversation going on on the Hill right now about what the appropriate level of a tax credit should be I think the Senate provision included a 73 percent rate on trade adjustment assistance And the President believes that trade promotion authority that includes trade adjustment assistance can and should be agreed to by the conferees this week He ll work with the Congress on that Q Is he making the calls MR FLEISCHER He hasn t made any phone calls yet this morning but he will The President the Vice President Dr Rice Secretary Powell will all be making calls underscoring the importance of trade promotion authority The other issue with trade promotion authority is while it s not impossible it s certainly harder to get it enacted into law the closer the election is This is an authority the President used to have routinely but no President has had it in almost the last decade There s been great progress made by the Congress this year the House of Representatives for the first time in almost a decade was able to pass it in the House The Senate has been historically a more strong supporter Q trying a whole bunch of trade deals in its absence China WTO Jordan I could go on with the list MR FLEISCHER We ll be able to sign far more in the event we have trade promotion authority And there are a number of trade agreements Mr Sanger which I know you re aware of that are being negotiated without the United States because we don t have trade adjustment trade promotion authority Q Back to TPA Would the President sign a TPA bill that contains the Dayton Craig amendment MR FLEISCHER Dayton Craig amendment is something the President feels very strongly about should not be a part of it He has conveyed that message directly and personally to members Q Would he accept something that falls short of the Dayton Craig amendment MR FLEISCHER The President has made it clear that he does not support that position END 1 00 P M EDT Click on your state below or go to the state list for more information
