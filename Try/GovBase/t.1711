behavioral disorders Our mission is to reduce the burden of mental illness and behavioral disorders through research on mind brain and behavior The burden is enormous The World Health Organization s Global Burden of Disease study reported that mental disorders comprise four of the top five sources of premature death and disability in 15 44 year olds in the Western world Schizophrenia bipolar disorder depression autism and other mental disorders are serious often life threatening illnesses for which we need reliable diagnostic tests new treatments and effective strategies for prevention Our public health mission mandates a focus on those with the most serious mental illness This is reflected in dollars with increasing expenditures over the past NIMH fiscal years FY NIMH Research

disorders just as molecular and cellular biology offer great hope for cancer heart disease and diabetes As with these other medical illnesses we recognize that progress in mental disorders requires an understanding of environmental as well as genetic factors NIMH is uniquely positioned to advance the understanding of gene environment interactions given our long history of support for the behavioral sciences By working with other NIH institutes on major http nihroadmap nih gov Roadmap goals NIMH is part of a broad ambitious coalition to ensure that the best biomedical science has a major impact on public health We recognize that developing new treatments for mental disorders means finding treatments that are effective for people of diverse socioeconomic racial and ethnic backgrounds for people with multiple health problems and for people who might not qualify for a traditional clinical trial Through its http www nimh nih gov studies index cfm clinical trials NIMH provides opportunities for patients and families to participate in treatment research as well as evaluation and prevention studies The involvement of the many people who participate in our clinical research studies is essential for generating knowledge with public health impact and is greatly appreciated People with mental disorders need new treatments but they also need access to the successful evidence based treatments already developed through research The http www mentalhealthcommission gov reports reports htm President s New Freedom Commission on Mental Health report describes the need to transform mental health care in America As explained in this historic report research must ensure that science in the laboratory links to service in the community NIMH has developed a http www nimh
