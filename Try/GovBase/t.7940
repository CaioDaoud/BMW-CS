Guideline Comparisons NGC Guideline Summaries from the NGC Web site NGC is designed to support printing of tables that are equal in width to the size of standard paper e g 11 inches Usually when a person has printing problems the source of the problem lies with the local setup of the computer the user s LAN and or the way that the user s network administrator has configured the services available to his her account NGC also cautions users to limit the total number of guidelines included in any one NGC Tabular Guideline Comparison to no more than 3 or 4 for optimal printing Because HTML is primarily a display output it may be possible to view complex NGC Guideline Comparisons containing more than four guidelines however printing is still limited to within the size of standard paper Some general tips if a user is still having trouble printing Choosing Print from the File Menu should walk the user through the appropriate steps for printing in his her particular environment If a user is trying to print a table that is wider than the width of standard paper switch the printer setup to Landscape Mode rather than use the typical default Portrait Mode If printing problems persist NGC recommends that users contact their network administrator to try and resolve the printing problems How do I maximize the screen display size when looking at the guideline views e g Brief Summary Complete Summary Guideline Comparison Guideline Synthesis Full Text The Hide Menu and Show Menu features located at the top of the page are designed to let users minimize and maximize the menus as needed We recommend that users use the Hide Menu feature when viewing the guideline summaries and other views in NGC in order to avoid having to scroll the display to the right to see the complete view How can I limit my search results to those guidelines that include an evidence table and or evaluation of the level of evidence for each recommendation The NGC search detailedsearch aspx

corresponding to the criteria a user enters or selects This is done to improve the relevance precision of the search results Is the NGC search engine case sensitive No NGC searches do not recognize the difference between upper and lower case letters My search returned a results page stating no guidelines were found Why doesn t NGC have any guidelines on my topic It is possible that a search may not find any guidelines matching the criteria specified This can happen for several reasons A search may be too narrow users should try broadening the search using the OR operator or truncating some of the words using the asterisk symbol A word may be misspelled The NGC Web site may not yet have the guideline its content is constantly changing with new guidelines added each week Bookmark this

supporting the recommendations NGC uses a systematic approach to decide when it is appropriate to include author year citations in the Major Recommendations field and full citations in the References Supporting the Recommendations field Two criteria drive the decision making process 1 the recommendations are explicitly stated and 2 those explicit statements are referenced The first criterion means the recommendations in the guideline document are easily identified stand alone action oriented statements Explicit recommendation statements are not interspersed among rationale in the guideline document Rationale for the recommendations may be provided in sections before or after the actual recommendations but not within the same body of content as the recommendations The second criterion means that the reference s supporting the explicit recommendation is are provided at the end of the statement References cited in the rationale for the recommendation are not captured Why are some fields like the References Supporting the Recommendations field displayed at some times but not at other times NGC will not display a field when the guideline document lacks content relevant to that field Why does the References Supporting the Recommendations field open up in a new window NGC thought you would want to choose when to view and or print the list of citations Some of the summaries contain hundreds of citations Why are certain clinical specialties like Primary Care no longer used in the controlled vocabulary list for the Clinical Specialty field Technically Primary Care is not a clinical specialty or subspecialty NGC chose to exclude it from the controlled vocabulary list Clinical subspecialties like Maternal Fetal Medicine were excluded from the controlled vocabulary list because NGC opted to lump subspecialties into the parent specialty in the example Maternal Fetal Medicine the parent specialty is Obstetrics and Gynecology Using the main clinical specialties instead of the main specialties along with the subspecialties reduces variability in abstraction and review How do I find guidelines written for Primary Care then NGC users can find Primary Care guidelines by
