satellite data was missing for two days Please replace all v1 0 CDAS with the new version The lack of ATOVS data produced a cooling in the 200 50 mb level in the tropics as well as minor warming in the mid troposphere and cooling in at the 850 mb level as shown http wesley wwb noaa gov cdas update 5 2003 index html here 5 12 2003 Minor port moved CDAS to new IBM computer frost snow starting with

Atmospheric Research NCAR The goal of this joint effort is to produce new atmospheric analyses using historical data 1948 onwards and as well to produce analyses of the current atmospheric state Climate Data Assimilation System CDAS Until recently the meteorological community has had to use analyses that supported the real time weather forecasting These analyses are very inhomogeneous in time as there have been big improvements in the data assimilation systems This played havoc with climate monitoring as these improvements were often produced changes in the apparent climate Even fundamental quantities such as the strength of the Hadley cell has changed over the years as a result of the changes in the data assimilation systems The quality and utility of the re analyses should be superior to NCEP s original analyses because a state of the art data assimilation is used more observations are used quality control has been improved the model data assimilation procedure will remain essentially unchanged during the project many more fields are being saved ex potential vorticity on isentropic surfaces diabatic heating global some older analyses were hemispheric better

caused the GOES not to be used Problems with March 1997 December 1997 reanalyses were found which will require a rerun of the affected months The problem is with the inclusion of too much Indian station data More cdas blacklist march97 html details are available Problems with aircraft winds used for 1976 1978 were discovered and the rerun was completed Jan 8 1997 The aircraft data were transposed E W which reduced the anomaly correlation by 5 points in a 5 day forecast The effect of this bad jet level data should be less severe in the lower troposphere This web site will have the updated data after an examination and the Phoenix AMS meeting The final TOGA COARE Nov92 Feb93 analysis still needs to be rerun The data on this web server is an interim analysis which doesn t use the
