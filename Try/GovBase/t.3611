Arctic for signs of climate change Clouds Radiation and Surface Processes Division Dr Chris Fairall Chief The CRSP division develops measurement systems and techniques and applies those systems techniques to various NOAA research missions Our research emphasis is on atmospheric boundary layer ABL physical processes and associated interactions with the surface ocean land ice and the free troposphere where we seek fundamental understanding to promote the development of parameterizations useful for numerical models and diagnostic studies Our measurement system emphasis is in remote sensors on NOAA satellites or surface based sensors developed at ETL mixed with complex integrated systems of in situ sensors for studies of surface interactions This division has participated in projects involving all three of NOAA s major research themes Short term forecasting FASTEX PACJET Interannual to decadal CLIVAR EPIC and GEWEX and Decadal to Centennial GASEX HOA and a variety of forecast and climate oriented research programs sponsored by other agencies The division supports other NOAA research and operational missions through development of NOAA satellite algorithms and mentoring atmospheric measurement systems on the NOAA ship Ronald H Brown the primary research vessel for OAR This division works jointly with the other ETL divisions and with PMEL AOML AL NESDIS and NCEP plus a host of universities and government laboratories Division working groups are cloud arctic Cloud and Arctic Research satellite Satellite Remote Sensing marine Marine and Air Sea Interaction http www etl noaa gov arctic Cloud and Arctic Research Taniel Uttal Lead CARG is presently involved with developing long term detailed data sets of cloud properties from a sophisticated suite of remote sensors radars IR radiometers MW radiometers and retrieval techniques which have been developed by ETL over the last 7 years An integral part of this activity is to validate the retrievals with in situ aircraft data to determine the accuracy of these novel methods The methods have been applied to data collected in the Arctic Ocean during the SHEBA program and are also being applied on an ongoing basis to data collected at the DOE ARM site in Barrow Alaska The group is also active in NOAA s CLIVAR EPIC study of deep convection and stratocumulus clouds in the eastern Pacific These data sets are being applied to a number of problems which impact studies of interannual and decadal change including developing and testing cloud parameterizations validating satellite based cloud retrievals and long term monitoring of marine and Arctic clouds This group is active in the development of interagency SEARCH initiative http www etl noaa gov satres Satellite Remote Sensing Dr Gary Wick Lead The Satellite Remote Sensing Program uses visible infrared active and passive microwave remote sensing to study weather and climate variability A major focus is on the development of long term data sets accurate calibration and intercalibration and development and application of radiative transfer theory Research efforts are focused in two main areas the global water and energy cycle and air sea interactions In the global water and energy cycle area observational weather and climate studies are performed using satellite water vapor cloud water rainfall and radiation budget data studies of water budget processes using NWP and GCM analysis products and spectroscopic studies of water vapor radiative transfer and combining surface based with satellite remote sensing Air sea interaction work is focused on application of satellite remote sensing to retrieval of SST the surface energy budget and ocean rough surface scattering air sea Marine and Air Sea Interaction Research Dr Jeff Hare Lead The Marine and Air Sea Interaction Research Group is primarily an experimental group investigating various issues in air sea ice interaction associated with the transfer of momentum heat moisture trace gases and particles at the wavy interface of the ocean Our principal focus is on fluxes measurement techniques studies of fundamental physical processes and development of simplified representations of those processes The group also deals with the scope of interactions atmospheric or oceanic from the microscale to boundary layer scales The work has application in various areas such as operational weather forecasting global climate modeling air quality assessment of CO2 trends improving satellite retrievals and understanding air sea interaction mechanisms
