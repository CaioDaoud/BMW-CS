and on the Caribbean coast Direct damages to infrastructure is estimated at 550 million The estimates of damage include 268 dead 106 600 evacuees and a total of 750 000 people affected It is estimated that perhaps 70 of the livestock 80 of the banana crop and 75 of the fruits and vegetables grown for export have been destroyed Towns and villages toward the El Salvador border and along the southern coast have experienced food fuel and emergency services shortages due to lack of adequate transportation http hurricane info usaid gov reports guatemala html USAID report on Guatemala http www

half of the labor force Coffee sugar and bananas are the main products Manufacturing and construction account for one fifth of GDP Since assuming office in January 1996 President ARZU has worked to implement a program of economic liberalization and political modernization The signing of the peace accords in December 1996 which ended 36 years of civil war removed a major obstacle to foreign investment In 1998 Hurricane Mitch caused relatively little damage to Guatemala compared to its neighbors Nevertheless growth will be somewhat smaller due to the storm Remaining challenges include increasing government revenues and negotiating a program with the IMF Population below poverty line NA Inflation rate consumer prices 6 4 1998 Labor force 3 32 million 1997 est Labor force by

Robert C Bucknam Project Summary The intense rains of Hurricane Mitch in October 1998 produced landslides in Guatemala that disrupted transportation and destroyed productive agricultural areas and farm to market access roads and trails Small farmer coffee processing infrastructure was also seriously affected Debris flow landslides added sediment to many stream drainages However little is known or documented about the nature and distribution of these landslides and many areas remain exposed to landslides from future periods of sustained heavy rainfall Strategy to Address the Problem In order to evaluate the scale and impact of the landslide threat and to develop strategies to deal with the failures the first step is to compile a comprehensive landslide inventory in the most heavily impacted areas The landslide inventory maps will show the distribution and characteristics of landslides in priority mapping areas Data will be provided in digital GIS compatible format on 1 50 000 scale base maps Maps will be compiled using large scale post Mitch stereo aerial photography Following completion of the photographic mapping project staff will conduct field reconnaissance studies in the priority areas to verify the accuracy of the mapping and to describe the field characteristics of the landslides and their geological setting Following photographic mapping and field verification the maps will be digitized and added to a GIS compatible database These digital maps will be the key product of this project The maps will be accompanied by a report that documents the extent and nature of the landslides and descriptions and discussion of the field observations If digital elevation models DEMs and geological information are available at appropriate scales in selected areas we will have the basic data needed to generate landslide susceptibility maps that would serve as examples of maps that could be used to make basic land use planning decisions The mapping will be carried out in close cooperation with Government of Guatemala counterparts Objectives Develop a comprehensive inventory of slope failures in selected parts of Guatemala that will provide a basis for characterizing the impact of Mitch related landslides in priority mapping areas Provide a basis for evaluating the landslide threat from future high intensity rainfall events to population infrastructure and agriculture Provide necessary equipment and training to in country counterparts to enhance their capability to monitor and assess on going landslide activity in Guatemala Landslide inventory maps will be produced for priority areas in the eastern Motagua Valley and adjacent ranges and the Polochic Valley and adjacent ranges of Guatemala Principle Central American counterpart
