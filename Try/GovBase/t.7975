Server Contact Us mailto Todd Spindler noaa gov Webmaster Having problems with the website Experiencing problems getting the latest information from the NHC TPC website We ve put together these notes to help solve a few of the more common problems you may encounter Here s a list of the most common problems The advisories don t agree with the times and numbers given on the homepage The full size maps don t match their thumbnails in the tropical cyclone Graphics sections The homepage seems to be stuck and won t update So what s going on here Here s a brief summary Your web browser saves caches a copy of every page you display so that when you return to the page without explicitly reloading the browser can load its copy of the page and save having to pull another copy of the page across the Internet This means faster browsing and less time waiting for a page to load However sometimes browsers hang onto their local copies longer than they should and you can end up viewing an out of date page With slow changing websites this is usually not a problem but as is the case of the NHC TPC website the homepage can change frequently during the course of a single day depending on the level of storm activity Notes on changes for the 2003 season For the 2003 season we have made changes in our website and our mirrors to address the stuck browser cache problem Some of you may have already noticed changes in our tropical cyclone advisory and graphics web addresses URLs In brief we ve implemented a dynamic URL method that will allow you to easily access the latest advisory and permit your browser to save a copy of an advisory without it getting stuck The most important thing to remember now is that to get the latest information you only need to refresh or reload the NHC TPC homepage Refreshing or Reloading the homepage will ensure that you will get a brand new set of dynamic URLs so that when you click on the advisories and graphics you will be directed to the very latest information available One more very important note don t bookmark any of the individual tropical cyclone advisories or graphics pages Only bookmark the NHC TPC homepage and reload it for the latest information If you bookmark one of our new dynamic URLs then you may end up viewing an out of date page if your browser cache gets stuck If reloading or refreshing doesn t update the homepage and you think it should then see the following secton The Stuck Browser Cache Fix for ways to fix that problem Note that the NHC TPC homepage updates only when there is a tropical cyclone in the Atlantic or Eastern Pacific The regular schedule of updates when a tropical cyclone is active can be found HAW2 english forecast process shtml here in our HAW2 english intro shtml Hurricane Awareness section An important note for webmasters Static links you have to any of the NHC TPC products that you have used in the past are still fully functional Note that we have shifted our pages from html extensions to shtml as part of the NWS wide format redesign with redirects in place to help legacy pages The Stuck Browser Cache Fix Go to the outdated page or graphic image and click on the button in your browser s toolbar labeled Refresh Internet Explorer or Reload Netscape For Netscape users do a Shift Reload hold down the Shift button when you click on Reload to do a Power Reload If that doesn t get the latest stuff then you need to manually clear your browser s cache or local stash of web pages and graphics Here s how Netscape users Edit Preferences Advanced Cache Clear Disk Cache and memory cache Internet Explorer users Tools Internet Options Temporary Internet Files Delete Files Now restart your browser If that still doesn t work then you may be behind a firewall or your ISP or system administrators are using a proxy or caching server These servers often save cache local copies of frequently requested web pages and graphics to reduce traffic loads Not infrequently these servers can retain their copies long after we ve changed them on our servers In that case you need to contact your system administrators or your ISP Tech Support for assistance If you ve tried all of the above you aren t behind a firewall you ve cowed your computer into meek submission and you are still seeing old advisories and images then mailto todd spindler noaa gov contact us and we ll see what we can do to help The Long winded and Rather Boring Technical Explanation The first thing you need to know is that when we update the NHC TPC homepage we read the new times and numbers directly from the new advisories which are sent to the servers at the same time as the updated home page Barring major network catastrophes and server meltdowns hey we re not perfect the servers are kept in careful and complete synchronization at all times The same is true for the graphics The small versions displayed on the storm graphics pages thumbnails are created by literally shrinking a copy of the originals on our central server and then both the thumbnails and the full size versions are sent immediately to the servers So then why are you seeing the wrong stuff Browsers automagically save copies of virtually everything you view on the web html pages pictures sound files animations and so on in hopes that the next time you visit a web site it will be able to use the locally saved versions instead of downloading new copies across the Internet Generally browsers will check for updated versions of everything but things don t always work as planned and you may end up with stale copies in your browser cache of long vanished pages and images that your browser insists are current Don t always believe what your computer says insist that it doublecheck its work Some users set their browser preferences to check every single time they visit a web site effectively eliminating this problem but that slows down your session with the extra chatter necessary between your browser and the Internet reducing the speed savings of the normally well behaved cache files Most folks just set their browser cache check to Automatic or First Time Each Session depending on browser type and version Savvy users reload everything anyway having learned to never trust their computers Top notch users periodically flush out their browser caches as a general maintenance and preventative procedure Then there is the misbehaving firewall proxy server problem which is outside of both our hands and yours generally requiring the intervention of your ISP s technicians or your system administrators to correct the problem Tropical Cyclone Tropical Weather TPC Information Topics storminfo Storm Information awareness Hurricane Awareness history Historical Information tafb Tropical
