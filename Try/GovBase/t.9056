COBRAS SAMBA CBR Anisotropy Satellite COBRAS SAMBA COsmic Background Radiation Anisotropy Satellite SAtellite to Measure Background Anisotropies INTRODUCTION Introduction RATIONALE Scientific Rationale GOALS Scientific Goals MISSION Mission Description instruments html Instrumentation Information Perform html Scientific Performance Introduction The COBE discovery of anisotropy in the cosmic microwave background radiation combined with the confirmation and new data of other experiments has opened a new direct probe of conditions in the early universe A high resolution high sensitivity nearly full sky map of these anisotropies would provide a wealth of new and highly important cosmological data These data would relate to three major areas the initial conditions for large scale galactic and larger structure form the high energy physics of the early universe e g inflation or topological defects and the geometry dynamics and topology of the universe COBRAS SAMBA is a mission proposed to the European Space Agency ESA The COBRAS SAMBA mission has completed and assessment study and was judged a viable mission under ESA guidelines The COBRAS SAMBA mission completed its 18 month Phase A Study in May 1996 At the end of the Phase A Study COBRAS SAMBA was selected to continue onto space flight There will be an ESA meeting in December to review the fate of the CLUSTER mission which was destroyed in the the Ariane V launch and the review the Middle Class mission program including COBRAS SAMBA which is designated M3 Middle Class mission 3 Scientific Rationale Cosmology is one of the oldest subjects of human inquiry and at the same time one of the newest sciences Questioning the origin and evolution of the Universe has been a characteristic human endeavor since before recorded history The science of cosmology emerged in this century when it first became possible to probe great distances through the Universe At first the observational breakthroughs occurred infrequently Hubble discovered the external galaxies and expansion of the Universe in the 1920 s Penzias and Wilson dicovered the cosmic microwave background in the 1960 s The compelling evidence for primordial nucleosynthesis of the elements amassed during the 1970 s and 1980 s Now the discovery of anisotropy in the cosmic microwave background allows decisive cosmological tests because the microwave background directly probes the oldest and farthest features in the Universe Anisotropy measurements that provide a spectrum of precise quantitative information would relate to three major areas of cosmology 1 the initial conditions for large scale galactic and larger structure formation 2 the high energy physics of the early universe e g inflation or topological defects and 3 the geometry dynamics and topology of the universe Summary of COBRAS SAMBA Scientific Goals The primary goal of COBRAS SAMBA mission is the production of high sensitivity one part per million high angular resolution 10 arcminutes maps of the microwave sky and thus of the cosmic microwave background In addition to having an actual high signal to noise map on which one can do morphological and topological work the goals include Determine the Precise Primordial Fluctuation Spectrum The first goal is to find to high precision few per cent or cosmic sample limit the fluctuation spectrum over the range from 10 arcminutes to large angular scales This provides the information necessary for large scale structure formation theory Test Inflation Primodial Gravity Waves Detection of primordial gravitons gravity waves and test of the relationships expected for inflation Statistics of the CMB Anisotropies The anisotropy statistics reveal information on their source Inflation generally predicts a gaussian parent distribution while topological defects predict deviation from gaussian distributions and rare peak fluctuations The statistics of the fluctuations are also important in setting the time scale for first structure formation Small scale Anisotropies and Reionization Anisotropy is partially erased on small to medium angular scales 30 Omega 1 2 arcminutes by an ionized intergalactic medium A careful measurement can determine or limit the possbility of an early ionized intergalactic medium and place constraints on or determine the thermal history of the Universe Small Scale Anisotropies and Galaxy Clustering 10 to 30 corresponds to galactic cluster scales 10h 1 Mpc Sunyaev Zel dovich Effect in Clusters of Galaxies Low energy CMB photons are scattered by energetic electrons of the hot intracluster seen in X rays medium COBRAS SAMBA should collect data on over 1 000 clusters The ROSAT satellite is compiling an all sky X ray catalog of clusters of galaxies among other things Of particular interest now is the question of the temperature profiles of clusters of galaxies as this impinges on the use of the Sunyaev Zel dovich method for determining Ho The combination of COBRAS SAMBA and ROSAT data will be particularly powerful in studying the Sunyaev Zel dovich effect Information on the potential Non cosmo Science html Non cosmological

designed to map the sky at multiple frequencies to both measure the CMB anisotropies and the various Galactic and extragalactic foreground emissions Multiple frequencies combined with the known spectral dependence and measurements at very different wavelengths allow the separation of the various components foregrounds inter GIF foreground emissions gif More on the foregrounds html Separation of the Foregrounds from the Primordial Fluctuations Solar System Effects Emission from the Earth Sun and other solar system bodies is the next major concern The effects of solar system emissions is controlled and minimized by using special far from Earth orbits Examples are Lagrange Point 2 L2 of the Earth Sun system and the Lagrange Point 5 L5 of the Earth Moon system The baseline orbit is the
