Standard Methods for the Examination of Dairy Products Recommended Procedures for the Examination of Seawater and Shellfish and Compendium of Methods for the Microbiological Examination of Foods of the American Public Health Association also Standard Methods for Water Analysis of the Environmental Protection Agency FDA works closely with AOAC International APHA EPA the International Dairy Federation IDF FIL and by way of participation in Codex Alimentarius the International Organization for Standardization ISO However not all methods appearing in the BAM have been collaboratively evaluated by one or more of these organizations Text for the BAM was peer reviewed by scientists outside and within FDA Introduction to the 8th edition Revision A 1998 Innovations in methods for the microbiological analysis of food continue to appear at a rapid pace Edition 8 1995 of the Bacteriological Analytical Manual BAM 8 contained numerous refinements of procedures and updates of references from the 1992 edition The list of commercially available test kits and the discussion of rapid methods in Appendix 1 were thoroughly revised Three chapters were added the use of reverse transcription RT and the polymerase chain reaction PCR to detect and quantify contamination of shellfish with hepatitis A virus Chapter 26 new procedures for the alkaline phosphatase test to determine whether dairy foods were prepared with pasteurized milk Chapter 27 and the use of PCR to detect toxigenic Vibrio cholerae in foods Chapter 28 For this printing BAM 8A the following has been revised or added Campylobacter Chapter 7 Yeast and Molds Chapter 18 Cyclospora Chapter 19 Parasites and Staphylococcus enterotoxins Chapter13 In addition there are updated tables in Appendix 1 on Rapid Methods and revised and corrected tables in Appendix 2 on MPN Appendix 3 reflects changes in media and corrects errors in the 8th Edition A table summarizing changes from BAM 8 to BAM 8A is included The methods described in Chapters 1 to 28 are those preferred by FDA for the microbiological analysis of foods drinks and cosmetics as well as for their containers contact materials and the production environment This is not necessarily the case for the rapid methods listed in Appendix 1 this appendix is a listing of different kits that are commercially available These methods have not necessarily been evaluated by FDA and listing of a method in this appendix does not constitute a recommendation To test for an organism or microbial toxin not covered by the BAM or to analyze a sample that may require special handling or processing the user is referred to the Official Methods of Analysis of the AOAC International Standard Methods for the Examination of Dairy Products Recommended Procedures for the

National Food Processors Association Reviews by FDA s field microbiologists who made valuable suggestions concerning content and practicality were coordinated by Meredith A Grahn and her staff The 8th Edition of the BAM was prepared in the Technical Editing Branch Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition FDA by Lois A Tomlinson with production assistance by Dorothy H Hughley This version
