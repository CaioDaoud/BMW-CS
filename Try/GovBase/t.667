assist industry in the development of standard specifications for pervasive computing devices NIST will validate protocols that will enable devices in a pervasive computing environment and will conduct performance evaluations on those technologies for coexistence NIST will also identify technologies and standards gaps and overlaps and work with industry to resolve the issues Technical Approach Horizontal wlan wpan shtml Modeling and Performance Evaluation of Wireless Personal Area Networks NIST continues to conduct validation simulation and analysis of WPAN protocols NIST developed a formal behavioral description of the IEEE 802 15 1 specification using the ITU T Specification and Description Language SDL the SDL is included as Annex B of the specification NIST is currently developing a formal behavioral model for the IEEE 802 15 4 low rate specification which is included as an Annex in the draft NIST has also conducted a performance evaluation of the WPAN and WLAN technologies based on detailed simulation models developed in C and OPNET The research focuses on the interference and coexistence of WLAN IEEE 802 11 and WPAN devices in the same environment sdp shtml Service Discovery and Dynamic Protocols NIST will develop architectural models and characterize the behavioral and performance properties of selected emerging service discovery protocols We will also design and characterize self adaptive mechanisms to improve performance of service discovery protocols in volatile and hostile environments Presentations and Talks Horizontal pubs NIST FTN012703
