assigned to the ICs according to standard PHS referral guidelines and specific program interests RESEARCH OBJECTIVES Background Individual ICs have used the R03 mechanism to provide limited support for specialized purposes For some ICs R03 awards have been available only through Requests for Applications RFAs and specific Program Announcements PAs To allow for unsolicited R03 applications the NIH has standardized the small grant application characteristics requirements preparation and review procedures Some of the ICs that are not listed as participants above or on the R03 website at http grants nih gov grants funding r03 htm http grants nih gov grants funding r03 htm may have small grant R03 programs that fall outside these guidelines and will be announced in specific RFAs or PAs issued by the Institute or Center The specific announcements for those programs should be consulted for relevant application guidelines SCOPE The common characteristic of the small grant is provision of limited funding for a short period of time Examples of the types of projects that ICs support with the R03 include the following o Pilot or feasibility studies o Secondary analysis of existing data o Small self contained research projects o Development of research methodology o Development of new research technology MECHANISM OF SUPPORT Applicants responding to this PA will use the NIH Small

grants nih gov grants funding submissionschedule htm The CSR will not accept any application in response to this PA that is essentially the same as one currently pending initial review unless the applicant withdraws the pending application The CSR will not accept any application that is essentially the same as one already reviewed This does not preclude the submission of a substantial revision of an R03 application already reviewed but such application must include an Introduction addressing the previous critique Although there is no immediate acknowledgement of the receipt of an application applicants are generally notified of the review and funding assignment within 8 weeks PEER REVIEW PROCESS Applications submitted for this PA will be assigned on the basis of established PHS referral guidelines An appropriate scientific review group convened either by the relevant IC or by CSR in accordance with the standard NIH peer review procedures http www csr nih gov refrev htm http www csr nih gov refrev htm will evaluate applications for scientific and technical merit As part of the initial merit review all applications will o Receive a written critique o Undergo a selection process in which only those applications deemed to have the highest scientific merit generally the top half of applications under review will be discussed and assigned a priority score REVIEW CRITERIA The NIH R03 small grant is a mechanism for supporting discrete well defined projects that realistically can be expected to be completed in two years and that require limited levels of funding Because the research plan is restricted to 10 pages a small grant application will not have the same level of detail or extensive discussion found in an R01 application Accordingly reviewers should evaluate the conceptual framework and general approach to the problem placing less emphasis on methodological details and certain indicators traditionally used in evaluating the scientific merit of R01 applications including supportive preliminary data Appropriate justification for the proposed work can be provided through literature citations data from other sources or from investigator generated data Preliminary data are not required particularly in applications proposing pilot or feasibility studies The goals of NIH supported research are to advance our understanding of biological systems improve the control of disease and enhance health In the written comments reviewers will be asked to discuss the following aspects of your application in order to judge the likelihood that the proposed research will have a substantial impact on the pursuit of these goals o Significance o Approach o Innovation o Investigator o Environment The scientific review group will address and consider each of these criteria in assigning the application s overall score weighting them as appropriate for each application The application does not need to be strong in all categories to be judged likely to have major scientific impact and thus deserve a high priority score For example an investigator may propose to carry out important work that by its nature is not innovative but is essential to move a field forward SIGNIFICANCE Does this study address an important problem If the aims of the application are achieved how will scientific knowledge be advanced What will be the effect of these studies on the concepts or methods that drive this field APPROACH Are the conceptual framework design methods and analyses adequately developed well integrated and appropriate to the aims of the project Does the applicant acknowledge potential problem areas and consider alternative tactics INNOVATION Does the project employ novel concepts approaches or methods Are the aims original and innovative Does the project challenge existing paradigms or develop new methodologies or technologies INVESTIGATOR Is the investigator appropriately trained and well suited to carry out this work Is the work proposed appropriate to the experience level of the principal investigator and other researchers if any ENVIRONMENT Does the scientific environment in which the work will be done contribute to the probability of success Do the proposed experiments take advantage of unique features of the scientific environment or employ useful collaborative arrangements Is there evidence of institutional support ADDITIONAL REVIEW CRITERIA In addition to the above criteria the following items will be considered in the determination of scientific merit and the priority score PROTECTION OF HUMAN SUBJECTS FROM RESEARCH RISK The involvement of human subjects and protections from research risk relating to their participation in the proposed research will be assessed See criteria included in the section on Federal Citations below INCLUSION OF WOMEN MINORITIES AND CHILDREN IN RESEARCH The adequacy of plans to include subjects from both genders all racial and ethnic groups and subgroups and children as appropriate for the scientific goals of the research will be assessed Plans for the recruitment and retention of subjects will also be evaluated See Inclusion Criteria in the sections on Federal Citations below CARE AND USE OF VERTEBRATE ANIMALS IN RESEARCH If vertebrate animals are to be used in the project the five items described under Section f of the PHS 398 research grant application instructions rev 5 2001 will be assessed ADDITIONAL CONSIDERATIONS BUDGET The reasonableness of the proposed budget and the requested period of support in relation to the proposed research AWARD CRITERIA Applications submitted in response to this PA will compete for available funds with all other recommended applications The following will be considered in making funding decisions o Scientific merit of the proposed project as determined by peer review o Availability of funds o Relevance to program priorities REQUIRED FEDERAL CITATIONS HUMAN SUBJECTS PROTECTION Federal regulations 45CFR46 require that applications and proposals involving human subjects must be evaluated with reference to the risks to the subjects the adequacy of protection against these risks the potential
