North Carolina Regional Coastal Erosion Studies Summary of Northern North Carolina Sedimentary Systems Project Hammar Klose Erika S Thieler E Robert North Carolina Geology Outer Banks Sea Floor Mapping Sedimentary Systems Coastal Systems Erosion U S Geological Survey Our long term vision is to acquire a sophisticated understanding of the entire coastal system of North Carolina A systematic mapping program in NC will provide similar information in this relatively higher energy sediment starved area the linkage of geologic framework and inner shelf processes to coastal evolution and coastal response to oceanographic and climatic forces The study area includes 250 km longshore distance of the inner shelf shoreface and coastal area between Duck and Cape Lookout to 10 km offshore The objectives of this project are 1 Provide a regional synthesis of the geologic framework of the inner shelf using sea floor and coastal mapping techniques The offshore segment of the study area will be surveyed with high resolution sidescan sonar 100 coverage subbottom profiling bathymetric and vibracoring systems 2 Assess potential offshore aggregate resources by developing a series of isopach maps of sediment deposits and surface distribution patterns 3 Compare conceptual models of inner shelf sediment transport with adjacent barrier island behavior identified using SWASH LIDAR surveys and corehole data 4 Identify the direction of net sediment transport and investigate the role oceanographic processes and antecedent geology play in controlling coastal evolution and modern behavior of the barrier island system 5 Make these mapping products data and interpretations available to clients collaborators and 6 Identify conduct studies to further understand the processes controlling sediment flux within the coastal system 08252001 table sets page width http www usgs gov USGS Logo Science for a Changing World http marine usgs gov Coastal and Marine Geology Program http

Description The USGS the State of North Carolina and university researchers are mapping the regional sedimentary framework of the inner shelf of northern North Carolina to understand recent coastal processes including erosion and the impacts of shoreline change The study area includes communities along the Outer Banks several national and state parks and refuges as well as Oregon Inlet one of the most dynamic inlets on the East Coast and the site of major political controversy for much of the last 30 years because of inlet stabilization strategies The mapping products will be used to investigate the role that geologic framework and physiography play in the dynamics of coastal evolution and behavior and to help identify sand resources suitable for beach nourishment The objectives of this project are 1 Provide a regional synthesis of the geologic framework of the inner shelf using sea floor and coastal mapping techniques The offshore segment of the study area will be surveyed with high resolution sidescan sonar 100 coverage subbottom profiling swath bathymetry and vibracoring systems 2 Assess potential offshore aggregate resources by developing a series of isopach maps of sediment deposits and surface distribution patterns 3 Compare conceptual models of inner shelf sediment transport with adjacent barrier island behavior identified using SWASH LIDAR surveys and
