climate changes when the amount of energy stored by the climate system is varied The most significant changes occur when the global energy balance between incoming energy from the Sun and outgoing heat from the Earth is upset There are a number of natural mechanisms that can upset this balance for example fluctuations in the Earth s orbit variations in ocean circulation and changes in the composition of the Earth s atmosphere In recent times the latter has been evident as a consequence not of natural processes but of man made pollution through emissions of greenhouse gases and aerosols By altering the global energy balance such mechanisms force the climate to change Consequently scientists call them climate forcing mechanisms info ipcc html Annual mean radiative forcings Wm 2 Global

is a complex series of processes through which all of the carbon atoms in existence rotate The same carbon atoms in your body today have been used in countless other molecules since time began The wood burned just a few decades ago could have produced carbon dioxide which through photosynthesis became part of a plant When you eat that plant the same carbon from the wood which was burnt can become part of you The carbon cycle is the great natural recycler of carbon atoms Unfortunately the extent of its importance is rarely stressed enough Without the proper functioning of the carbon cycle every aspect of life could be changed dramatically CMDL Groups studying the Carbon Cycle ccgg index html Carbon Cycle Greenhouse Gases hats index html Halocarbons other Atmospheric Trace Species

form of shortwave visible and ultraviolet UV energy As this radiation travels toward the Earth the atmosphere absorbs 25 of it and 25 is reflected by the clouds back into space The remaining radiation travels unimpeded to the Earth and heats its surface The Earth releases a lot of energy it has received from the Sun back to space However the Earth is much cooler than the Sun so the energy re emitted from the Earth s surface is much weaker in the form of invisible longwave infrared IR radiation sometimes called heat Greenhouse gases like water vapor carbon dioxide methane and nitrous oxide trap the infrared radiation released by the Earth s surface The atmosphere acts like the glass in a greenhouse allowing much of the shortwave solar radiation to travel through unimpeded but trapping a lot of the longwave heat energy trying to escape back to space This process makes the temperature rise in the atmosphere just as it does in the greenhouse This is the Earth s natural greenhouse effect and keeps the Earth 33 C warmer than it would be without an atmosphere at an average 15 C In contrast the moon which has no atmosphere has an average surface temperature of 18 C CMDL Groups studying

greenhouse effect What Role does Radiation play in Determining the Earth s Climate Energy or solar radiation enters the atmosphere as sunshine The sky reflects a portion of this radiation the rest is absorbed by the Earth and is eventually released again as thermal radiation Both man made and naturally occurring events can limit the amount of solar radiation at the earth s surface Urban air pollution smoke from forest fires and airborne ash resulting from volcanic activity reduce the solar resource by increasing the scattering and absorption of solar radiation Some scientists think of the radiation budget in terms of a balance If the Earth gets more energy from the Sun the Earth heats up and emits more thermal energy This brings the radiation budget into balance If the Earth emits more of this thermal energy than it absorbs from solar radiation the Earth cools off As it cools off the Earth emits less energy This change also brings the radiation budget back into balance CMDL
