is critical because we know the result of peer review is the primary factor determining which research NIH funds Welcome to the Center for Scientific Review CSR Web site at the National Institutes of Health NIH CSR organizes the peer review groups that evaluate the majority 70 of the research grant applications sent to NIH The Center also receives all grant applications for NIH as well as for some other components of the U S Department of Health and Human Services Our primary goal is to see that NIH applications receive fair independent expert and timely reviews free from inappropriate influences so NIH can fund the most promising research The number of applications reviewed by CSR soared to 41 899 55 between fiscal years 1998 and 2003 and the complexity and breadth of biomedical and behavioral research has likewise increased during this period CSR s responsibilities have thus grown and become more complex CSR has responded by 1 reaching out to the scientific community for guidance 2 launching a reorganization of its scientific review groups or study sections 3 incorporating new technologies and practices 4 hiring additional scientific review administrators and 5 focusing on the quality and speed of the service CSR provides to the NIH and the scientific community CSR reviews most investigator initiated fellowship and small business innovative research SBIR and small business technology transfer STTR applications sent to NIH The NIH Institutes and other Centers that fund research review the remaining applications which are most specific to their individual missions CSR currently has over 170 chartered study sections and standing special emphasis panels which are clustered in Integrated Review Groups IRGs according to particular themes or areas of

Groups CSR is systematically reorganizing its study sections into 23 new IRGs so they can better review the more complex and multidisciplinary grant applications NIH receives Scientific Boundary Teams of experts from the scientific community and the NIH Institutes and Centers have completed proposed designs for these new groups CSR has already begun implementing them To ensure that the reorganization proceeds smoothly CSR continues to consult experts from the scientific community and the NIH Institutes and Centers Incorporating Electronic Technologies CSR is integrating new technologies to enhance and speed the receipt referral and review processes Almost all CSR reviewers may use the Internet Assisted Review program to securely submit and share application critiques with their fellow study section members before they meet This program helps reviewers better focus their reviews and it speeds the production of summary statements In addition CSR provides reviewers CDs containing application images instead of large boxes of paper applications CSR staff is also working with officials from NIH and Department of Health and Human Services to develop and pilot a system that will allow applicants to submit their applications electronically Other CSR software programs are being developed to speed the referral of applications to study sections and to identify and recruit reviewers Enhancing the Abilities of Reviewers and Study Sections CSR has launched multiple initiatives to develop new practices to enhance its peer review process Efforts are underway to 1 develop a regulatory checklist that reviewers may use to address the many regulatory issues they must now consider 2 recruit senior advisory reviewers to add extra experience and expertise when needed and 3 train reviewers to enhance their abilities to assess increasingly complex applications CSR has also recruited a Special Advisor on Clinical Research to serve as a liaison with the external clinical research communities and to suggest new approaches to reviewing clinical research proposals One CSR initiative recently advanced further than imagined A CSR effort to develop new ways to encourage review and fund innovative or high risk research was incorporated into the larger NIH Roadmap initiative Engaging Scientists From the Community In the last fiscal year 2003 11 000 external experts served on CSR s study sections which often met three times during the year An additional 10 000 scientists served on other NIH advisory groups including study sections organized by the NIH Institutes and Centers and their advisory councils which provide a second level of peer review and make funding recommendations based on priorities set by Congress the Department of Health and Human Services and the public The generous support of the scientific community is critical to the success of the NIH peer review system and the identification of research best for advancing public health Many scientists from the community also have served on CSR committees panels and working groups assisting CSR in reorganizing and evaluating its structure and practices CSR is very grateful for all of the efforts of these scientists and we plan to do more to reach out to the community to inform them and involve them in ongoing efforts to advance the peer review process Last Update November
