decided to give something back to the community and volunteer his time to start a project at Laurel High School Mike had a goal of increasing student interest in the space science field and prepare the students for future careers The Cooperative Satellite Learning Project CSLP was born Mike believed that businesses have a responsibility and debt to pay to the education system He felt that the business world is a complex related system becoming more complex at alarming rates Mike realized that businesses spend large sums of money and time teaching skills to employees in order to produce the type of employee needed Why not transfer some of these resources to the school system thus developing a skilled work force before high school graduation Mike envisioned a program focusing at a high school level core group of students The core groups are part of a dedicated class and would interact with each other then with other classes in the school and then take what they learned to other schools Outreach activities would involve decision analysis and trade studies and require effective communications and quick response Students would learn to tackle tasks and build systems well beyond what they thought possible at first glance Mike s vision would provide students with real career knowledge and choice creating not only the words but the feel of a career This could be accomplished by using work internships video demonstrations interactive video systems and virtual reality systems The project would remain updated through business contributions and direct involvement The First CSLP By October Mike had defined his concept and briefed Laurel High school on his ideals From October through January 1991 Mike worked with the school planning and developing a partnership commitment From January 1991 through June 1991 volunteer student groups meet at Laurel and worked out details of what the CSLP would develop into In September 1991 the CSLP began in full force with a new student group and a dedicated class period for CSLP Students studied the Solar Anomalous Magnetosphere Particle Explorer SAMPEX mission Volunteers from ATSC and NASA came to the school to teach students about spacecraft flight operations SAMPEX was launched September 1992 Students began to develop the first Mission Monitoring System MMS In January 1991 Governor Schaefer was briefed on the project and offered his support A formal ribbon cutting ceremony in March 1992 opened the MMS and the Space Awareness Center SAC Students from several elementary schools were bused to Laurel to learn about special programs telling them about space science In June 1992 President Bush was briefed by students on CSLP at Goddard In April 1993 the CSLP students operated SAMPEX for a day of orbital operations Additional Schools to Join CSLP South Fayette in McDonald Pennsylvania was the second school to join the partnership Like Laurel South Fayette started as a CSLP light school and then grew into a dedicated program A three month planning period resulted in a project plan in January 1991 The proof of concept period was January to May 1991 The first full scale year program began in the 91 92 school year Students at South Fayette felt the CSLP taught leadership and work related skills offered opportunities not available in other classes allowed students to work hands on with NASA scientists and engineers and gave students experiences useful in college and later careers In February 1994 a MMS was dedicated at South Fayette In December 1994 Woodlawn High School joined the CSLP partnership by developing a CSLP light program DuVal High School also formed a CSLP light program and became full up in January 1997 Since this time 8 schools from five states have created CSLP programs The CSLP Staff Originally all work done for CSLP was preformed by dedicated volunteers on there own time During the school year 1994 95 NASA office of Space Physics Division provided funding for the first full time CSLP director This position was first held by ATSC employee Mike Rice On March 1996 Mike Rice left CSLP to pursue interests in spacecraft flight operations Marilyn Glass became the second CSLP director home html Back to CSLP Home
