Akerkar University of Arizona JPrimack snap all sfr snap 163 jpg a There is mounting evidence that galaxy interactions play an important role in galaxy evolution Elliptical galaxies spiral bulges and a significant fraction of all the stars in the universe may be byproducts of galaxy mergers especially mergers at high redshift Hydrodynamical simulations of galaxy interactions have given evidence of the role mergers play in galaxy evolution but the galaxies used in these simulation have primarily been of equal mass with low gas fractions typical of spiral galaxies in the local universe In order to better understand the roles mergers play in galaxy evolution we are using high resolution simulations including hydrodynamics and star formation to investigate the full parameter space of pre merger galaxy properites and interaction parameters A main goal of our work is modeling the star formation rates and the morphology of interacting galaxies in various wavelengths Time evolution MPEGs

graph of the flux vs wavelength vs viewing angle Figure A and of the polarization vs wavelength vs viewing angle Figure B For viewing angles where the toroid obscures the underlying atmosphere a strong absorption feature appears in the flux spectrum Observations of such a feature allows one to determine the 3 dimensional geometry of the supernova ejecta and hence put strong constraints on the progenitors and explosion physics of Type Ia supernovae Flux as a function of viewing angle PNugent toroid toroid flux992 3 mpg MPEG Polarization as a function of viewing angle PNugent toroid toroid

nonlinear systems whose wave dispersion relation is also a function of amplitude It is an ideal testing ground for quantum lattice gas algorithms because exact solutions are known for the NLS equation In particular some of these exact solutions are solitons nonlinear localized wavepackets that retain their identity even after collisions with other wavepackets Click on the image to see the time evolution of two soliton like intial conditions under the NLS equation with potential V psi The two solitons are unstable and break up resulting in coherent structures solitons interacting with a turbulent sea of very small amplitude solitons The collisions of the coherent structures do not destroy these structures George Vahala Physics Dept William Mary RRyne beam400 jpg The LEDA experiment
