the Meats Research Unit are to reduce the risk of foodborne illness associated with the consumption of red meat to respond to the research needs of the Food Safety and Inspection Service of the USDA to increase efficiency of lean meat production and to improve eating quality of meat Food safety research addresses the microbial status of the meat from slaughter to table using both molecular and standard microbiological techniques Unique methods are developed and validated for sampling carcasses and trim and for isolating and identifying pathogens that may be present Molecular techniques are used to track contamination to its source in order to discover additional hurdles that will decrease the transfer of pathogens to the carcass Factors that affect the survival and recovery of pathogens in stored and cooked meat products as well as on refrigerated beef carcasses are examined Special emphasis is placed on improving intervention strategies and developing new directed strategies designed to decrease pathogen contamination of red meat without adversely affecting meat quality All of the information acquired will be integrated into forms usable by the meat industry as part of HACCP plans Meat quality research is directed toward identifying key steps in the regulation of muscle protein breakdown during growth and during postmortem storage Special emphasis is placed on the identification of areas of the genome that regulate carcass composition and meat quality the development of methodologies to classify carcasses based on tenderness and lean meat yield the effect of breed on carcass composition and meat quality and the development of intervention technologies to optimize meat tenderness Current Projects Title Control of Pathogenic and Spoilage Bacteria on Red Meat Objectives Develop antimicrobial intervention strategies for slaughter processing and fabrication and determine intervention effects on microbial safety spoilage and ecology of the resulting products e g carcass subprimal trim ground beef Develop representative sampling procedures and sensitive accurate and rapid diagnostic methods to detect foodborne pathogens and other microbial contaminants Determine the effects of previous environment and or intervention procedures on the induction of adaptive responses in bacteria that result in increased antimicrobial resistance and or virulence Determine and characterize molecular mechanisms of pathogen resistance and virulence development and develop procedures to prevent these occurrences Title Develop On Line Verification and Intervention Procedures for HACCP in Slaughter Processing Systems Objectives Develop practical antimicrobial intervention strategies for slaughter processing and fabrication that maintain product quality Develop improved sampling detection and identification methods for monitoring and verification of Critical Control Points CCPs Determine and characterize molecular mechanisms and sources of pathogen virulence acquisition and develop procedures to prevent these occurrences Investigate genomic and virulence characteristics of pathogens and apply this information to the elimination of pathogens from the meat supply Title Strategies to optimize carcass yield and meat quality of red meat animals Objectives Evaluate effects of breeds of cattle swine and sheep representing diverse biological types on carcass composition and meat quality Identify quantitative trait loci QTL and genes for carcass composition and meat quality traits in cattle swine and sheep and utilize proteomics functional genomics tools to determine their mode of action Use biochemical and genomics tools to test the hypothesis that the calpain proteolytic system regulates muscle growth and development Evaluate the efficacy of various non invasive methods and develop new non invasive methods to predict meat quality Identify the relative contribution of connective tissue muscle shortening postmortem proteolysis and other physiological parameters to tenderness of various muscles and use this information to develop muscle specific intervention strategies to optimize meat tenderness Scientific Staff
