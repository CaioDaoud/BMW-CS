Residential facilities that provide nonmedical alcoholism or drug abuse recovery treatment or detoxification services to adults must be licensed by the Department of Alcohol and Drug programs Health and safety concerns are the primary focus of licensure The Department also certifies both residential and outpatient alcohol and other drug treatment programs Certification is voluntary It is considered advantageous in gaining the confidence of both potential program participants and third party payers as it signifies a program meets minimal levels of service and is in substantial compliance with state program standards Licensure or certification are required to be eligible for funding under the Substance Abuse and Crime Prevention Act of 2000 Licensure InitialLicenseApp shtml
