FSL Aircraft Data Information FSL Aircraft Data ACARS AMDAR Information http www fsl noaa gov FSL uses the term ACARS to designate automated weather reports from commercial aircraft These data are routed by several cooperating airlines to FSL and we decode and quality control the data More generally ACARS stands for the Aircraft Communications Addressing and Reporting System which is managed by Aeronautical Radio Inc http www arinc com ARINC ACARS is used by airlines to transmit a variety of proprietary air to ground communications Our web site also includes AMDAR data from many European and Asian air carriers The AMDAR data are subjected to the same quality control and other processing by us as the ACARS data Demonstration displays showing past ACARS data are available to all in the http acweb fsl noaa gov demo java java version or http acweb fsl noaa gov demo non java version Because the ACARS data processed at FSL are proprietary to the airlines providing the data the following guidelines have been developed regarding access In the statements below ACARS refers to all aircraft data from FSL including AMDAR data Real time ACARS data may be made available to those organizations that are performing research which in the judgment of FSL is likely to benefit the airlines providing the data The data may not be redistributed in real time However the use of images in research publications is allowed and encouraged Researchers are encouraged to use ACARS data in Numerical Weather Prediction models NWP model results may be made available to the public in real time provided that all of the following conditions are met Adapted 26 April 2001 Individual ACARS measurements may not be revealed though gross numbers may be ACARS must be one of several kinds of input observations such as radiosondes and METARs The model and data may not be used to develop products or services for sale Real time data are available to government agencies such as NOAA in support of forecasting operations Real time data may be made available only to those airlines that provide ACARS meteorological data to the US Government at their own expense Data may not be shared with affiliate or code share airlines Language clarified 26 April 2001 Real time data may not be made available to commercial entities that would use them to develop products or services they plan to offer for sale to the participating airlines If you would like to receive FSL ACARS data and believe you are eligible please have a faculty member or other responsible official of your organization send an email to mailto acars request fsl noaa gov acars request fsl noaa gov briefly describing your proposed use of the data a couple of sentences should suffice and agreeing not to redistribute the data and not to use it to develop commercial products or services We will reply by email with access information or explaining why we cannot provide access Once approved you can receive ACARS data in several ways Web based graphical displays either java based or not Web based access to binary data in netCDF format LDM access to binary data in netCDF format ACARS should not be confused with MDCRS the Meteorological Data Collection and Reporting System MDCRS is a database and processing system developed and controlled by ARINC MDCRS contains most but not all of the data available through FSL and uses different decoding and quality control software and access channels Frequently Asked Questions whatsit What is FSL ACARS data access How do I get access variables What variables are available how many How many data are there bytes What is the storage data transmission load qc What quality control is applied to the data altitude What kind of altitude is reported averaging Are the data averaged resolution What is the resolution accuracy What is the accuracy timliness How timely are the data retrospective Are retrospective data available uses How have the data been used providers What airlines provide FSL with data What variables are available Most aircraft provide latitude longitude altitude time temperature wind direction and speed In addition a number of aircraft report measures of turbulence Eddy dissipation rate is reported by about 100 UAL aircraft that fly mostly over the United States These data are experimental and should not yet be relied upon for turbulence verification derived equivalent vertical gust is reported by about 80 international AMDAR aircraft that fly over Europe and Asia The translation between DEVG values and turbulence severity is as follows DEVG Turbulence Severity 2 m s Nil 2 4 5 m s Light 4 5 9 m s Heavy 9 m s Severe How many data are there Currently we are getting just about 140 000 wind and temperature observations per day 100 000 of which are over the continental United States These data come from more than 4000 aircraft There are more data during the daytime than at night but thanks to participation by some parcel carrying airlines nighttime coverage is substantial What is the storage data transmission load about 1 8 megabytes per hour in netCDF format 150 kilobytes per hour in the format downloaded to the java display The non java display downloads gif images which have sizes from 2 to 75 kilobytes depending on the amount of data shown and whether a satellite background image is requested What quality control is applied to the data The ACARS data stream is very high quality with less than 2 of the data showing problems Nevertheless all data shown on the web site or available for download have been quality controlled at FSL This processing includes interpolating location and time information to those data such as high resolution ascent data that lack it Data that fail quality control are indicated by a special color on the web plots and several quality control and interpolation flags are available in the netCDF data that indicate exactly what test s and interpolation each datum was subjected to Details of the quality control are available qc info html here What kind of altitude is reported The altitude determining physical variable is pressure This is converted to altitude by using a standard atmosphere The standard atmosphere is used at all altitudes and under all pressure conditions Thus for instance it is possible to have ACARS altitudes below ground level on days with high atmospheric pressure This is in contrast to other aviation reports such as voice PIREPS that use a standard atmosphere to compute altitude above 18 000 ft MSL but use the current altimeter setting for lower altitudes Are the data averaged No All ACARS data are point samples not averaged in time or space Specifically this means that the averaging time is approximately 1 sec or less What is the resolution At flight altitudes above about 23 000 ft data are generally taken every 5 6 minutes Near airports the data spacing is decreased by some airlines in several different ways 2000 and 1000 ft vertical resolution below 18 000 ft is quite common On ascent more than 150 aircraft provide data with a vertical resolution of 300 ft for the first minute after take off up to about 2500 ft AGL What is the accuracy Benjamin Schwartz and Cole 1999 Weather and Forecasting in review collocation study with ACARS reports Estimated wind vector accuracy 1 8 m s estimated temperature accuracy 0 5 deg C These numbers are much lower than the previous ACARS RAOB differences which by definition included RAOB error Decker R R D Mamrosh and C E Weiss 1999 ACARS operational assessment description and interim results Preprints 3rd Conference on Integrated Observing Systems Dallas TX Amer Meteor Soc 24 27 From http acweb fsl noaa gov docs mamrosh ams 98 Richard D Mamrosh 1998 Several studies have compared ACARS with other data sources Among these http acweb fsl noaa gov docs mamrosh ams 98 lord Lord et al 1984 compared ACARS flight level winds with radiosonde cloud motion and VAS thermally derived winds When ACARS was compared to radiosondes root mean square RMS deviations were 7 4 degrees in direction and 5 3 m s in speed More recently http acweb fsl noaa gov docs mamrosh ams 98 schwartz Schwartz and Benjamin 1995 compared ACARS ascent descent winds and temperatures with radiosondes and found temperature differences were less than 2C on 94 percent of all occasions and less than 1C better than 68 percent of the time Wind speed RMS deviations were 4 1 m s while direction RMS differences were 35 degrees mostly due to light and variable wind situations How timely are the data Data are processed at FSL every 10 minutes starting on the hour If you access the data shortly after they are processed the most recent data may be only a couple of minutes old However some airlines buffer the data on board the aircraft Reports on ascent and descent are generally buffered for 0 to 2 minutes depending on airline and aircraft type however some over ocean reports may be buffered for several hours Gruesome additional details Every 10 minutes starting on the hour data arriving since the end of the last complete hourly file are processed Processing takes about 10 seconds At 18 min past the hour the last complete hourly file is generated I e at 0118 a file containing data for 0000 0059 59 is generated In order to catch late arriving reports this file is regenerated approximately 1 2 3 6 and 12 hours later Times are shifted by a minute or so that jobs don t overlap So if you want to get the most complete data set wait at least 12h 22m Are retrospective data available On the web 30 days of data are generally kept on line Data in netCDF format more than 48 hours old are available through FSL s http www sdd fsl noaa gov MADIS index html MADIS program Data are available back to 1 July 2001 Interested parties may fill out this http www sdd fsl noaa gov MADIS data application html data application In the past upon special request FSL has occasionally restored earlier data from tape backups but we aren t equipped to do this routinely nor for large time periods more than several hours Data go back to 13 August 1996 with some gaps for the non java display For the Java display retrospective data go back to 2 June 1999 How have the data been used NOAA forecast offices have been using FSL s ACARS data for several years One on line publication that describes the use of the data at one forecast office is http acweb fsl noaa gov docs mamrosh ams 98 THE USE OF HIGH FREQUENCY ACARS SOUNDINGS IN FORECASTING CONVECTIVE STORMS by Richard D Mamrosh of the National Weather Service Chicago Illinois We also have begin compiling NWS docs fcst disc Forecast Discussions that mention ACARS ACARS are critical asynoptic data for the Rapid Update Cycle RUC LAPS and the Eta models and are also assimilated into global models What airlines provide FSL with data Currently participating U S airlines are American Delta Federal Express
