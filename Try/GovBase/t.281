standing at the expense of citizen democracy Assembly Democrats passed a series of bills designed to politicize the elections process in California and weaken safeguards against voter fraud Democrats are taking advantage of a politically weakened Governor Davis by rushing legislation through the process that will consolidate their partisan power at the expense of fair elections and grassroots democracy said Assembly Republican Leader Dave Cox R Fair Oaks All Californians should be outraged that Democrats are willing to politicize voter registration circumvent the initiative process and make it easier to commit voter fraud in order to further their political objectives With no Republican support Democrats passed AB 828 and 1245 during today s Assembly floor session Last week Assembly Bill 587 was sent to Governor Davis Other legislation to undermine fair elections Assembly Bills 190 and 503 will likely be considered by the Assembly this week Following is a summary of these bills and what they would do Assembly Bill 587 AB 587 introduced by Mark Ridley Thomas D Los Angeles requires county elections officials to include sections for racial or ethnic background on voter registration forms The California Association of Clerks and Elections Officials argue that AB 587 will impose a significant state mandate because of necessary modifications to computer software programs and ongoing data entry costs The provisions of AB 587 contradict the proposed Racial Privacy Initiative which will appear on the October 7th recall election ballot as Proposition 54 Proposition 54 prohibits state and local agencies from collecting data from individuals on racial or ethnic background If both measures are enacted into law it will likely create great confusion for already overwhelmed local elections officials This measure passed the Assembly 44 to 30 with no Republican support and now moves to the Governor s desk Assembly Bill 828 AB 828 introduced by Mark Leno D San Francisco requires local elections officials to establish alternative voting procedures for use when an electronic voting system fails or when a polling place runs out of ballots Undermining the provisional voting process this legislation allows elections officials to go as far as allowing voters to cast their official ballot by pen paper and a sample ballot This will make our elections process less secure and creates the potential for massive voter fraud This measure passed the Assembly 47 to 31 with no Republican support and now moves to the Governor s Desk Assembly Bill 1245 AB 1245 introduced by John Laird D Santa Cruz requires proponents of proposed initiatives to submit draft language of the proposal to the Secretary of State for posting on the Internet Currently initiative proponents are required to submit the language of their proposed initiative to the Attorney General who prepares the title and summary Once this process is completed proponents have 180 days to seek enough signatures to place the initiative on the ballot This legislation requires proponents to submit draft language to the Secretary of State before they submit language to the Attorney General AB 1245 will likely lead to voter confusion and the undermining of the entire initiative process This measure was approved by the Assembly 46 to 30 with no Republican support and now moves to the Governor s Desk Assembly Bill 190 AB 190 introduced by Lloyd Levine D Van Nuys requires elections officials to count provisional ballots for voters who do vote in their home precinct even if the ballot contains candidates or measures on which the voter was not entitled to vote This measure will further undermine the provisional voting process and could potentially lead to more voter fraud in California This measure was gutted and amended in the Senate It was re referred to the Assembly Elections Committee for a policy committee hearing on the new amendments Assembly Bill 503 AB 503 introduced by Christine Kehoe D San Diego permits unions to use school resources funded by taxpayer dollars to urge the support or defeat of a ballot measure or candidate Ultimately the bill gives teachers unions a free hand to campaign in schools using taxpayer resources to foot the bill Specifically the bill overturns a Public Employees Relations Board ruling that banned the use of public resources for political purposes The measure would allow unions to use state funded resources and distribute explicit political campaign material on school campuses Last year Governor Davis vetoed similar legislation by the same author This measure was approved by the Assembly in April and is awaiting a final vote on the Senate floor Having trouble with this site mailto republican assembly ca
