Witherell has changed the name of the Beams Division to the Accelerator Division I agree that the new name conveys the nature of the organization more effectively especially to the outside world said Witherell The new name is already in effect News from the Users Executive Committee Sharon Hagopian Sharon Hagopion UEC Chair The Fermilab Users Executive Committee met on November 22 Director Mike Witherell talked to the UEC about the status of the laboratory The UEC learned that approximately 250 people worked in the tunnels during the shutdown The biggest success so far was the reduction in the emittance in the recycler Witherell also mentioned recent reviews of the accelerator BTeV and NuMI MINOS and discussed the DOE 20 year Science Facilities Plan A number of other people also presented at the UEC meeting Leslie Groer of DZero and a UEC member reported on a meeting at BNL on Visa Issues Elliot McCrory of the Beams Division presented a phenomenological model of Tevatron

shutdown last week As you can read in the http www fnal gov pub news03 update html Accelerator Update a large quench damaged a cryogenic element in the Tevatron that will require a warm up of the sector to repair an operation that will take a week to ten days What happens after such an event A large number of people from around the Accelerator Division formerly known as the Beams Division devise a plan to accomplish the repair quickly and carefully and to make best use of the unscheduled shutdown Accelerator experts conduct an investigation into the series of events to understand how to prevent this particular incident but also to see whether one can abort the beam in a more controlled way when something like this occurs All of the AD departments and the running experiments turn in work lists for maintenance and repair jobs that require beam to be off The operations department decides which work to do this week to take best advantage of the unscheduled shutdown Later in the week accelerator studies will be done in the unaffected tunnels getting work done that would otherwise require a pause in accelerator operations later Meanwhile progress continues in other parts of the accelerator complex Experts tuning the Booster were able to improve the proton intensities for collider operation and for MiniBoone to the levels achieved before the major changes made during the annual shutdown Tuning of the Antiproton Source restored a good rate for collecting antiprotons Some of those antiprotons were successfully transferred to the Recycler and stored there with excellent lifetime confirming the good news about the results of the massive amount of work done on the Recycler during the ten week shutdown We are losing a week of operations this week something that happens a few times per year The accelerator experts will be improving performance in the weeks to come as they convert their improved understanding of the accelerators into higher luminosity and steadier operation Accelerator Update December 5 December 8 Switchyard received permission to receive beam The Tevatron suffered a sixteen house quench Related cryogenic problems shuts down the Tevatron for a
