oceans ice are only applicable in the filter bands associated with those scenes Source EPO SOURCE PLATFORM The observational environment entity or structure which holds the data collection device usually an instrument It may be a satellite aircraft ground station buoy ship person in the case of human observations or hand held instruments computer in the case of computer model data or a questionaire in the case of a paper survey e g CIESIN s Census data SPACECRAFT The spacecraft is the EOS space or orbiting component composed of the payload and mission unique equipment required to support the EOS mission It includes propulsion separation springs and user interface equipment not unique to the launch vehicle Source EPO SPACECRAFT ENGINEERING DATA Data produced by the engineering sensor s of a spacecraft that are used to determine the physical state of the spacecraft in order to operate it or monitor its health Source EPO SPACE NETWORK SN The NASA assets required to communicate with Earth orbiting spacecraft via the TDRSS Source EPO SPECIAL DATA PRODUCTS See EOS DATA PRODUCTS STANDARD DATA PRODUCTS See EOS DATA PRODUCTS STRATOSPHERE Region of the atmosphere between the troposphere and mesosphere having a lower boundary of approximately 8 km at the poles to 18 km at the equator and an upper boundary of approximately 50 km Depending upon latitude and season the temperature in the lower stratosphere can increase be isothermal or even decrease with altitude but the temperature in the upper stratosphere generally increases with height due to absorption of solar radiation by ozone Source EPO SUPPORT EQUIPMENT Equipment used to interface with the spacecraft for the purpose of simulating the command and telemetry interface which will be present in the EOC as well as providing additional status information that may be nec essary in the integration and verification processes Source EPO TEAM LEADER TL The person designated by the EOS Program as ultimately responsible for the delivery and performance of Standard Data Products derived from an EOS Facility Instrument Source EPO TEAM MEMBER TM A person designated by the EOS Program to develop algorithms for Standard Data Products derived from an EOS Facility Instrument Source EPO TELEMETRY A space to ground data stream of measured values including instrument science data instrument engineering data and spacecraft engineering data that does not include command tracking computer memory transfer audio or video signals Source EPO THERMOSPHERE Outermost layer of the atmosphere above the mesosphere Source EPO TRACE GAS A minor constituent of the atmosphere The most important trace gases contributing to the greenhouse effect are water vapor carbon di oxide ozone methane nitrous oxide and chloro fluorocarbons Other trace gases include ammonia nitric oxide ethylene sulfur dioxide methyl chloride carbon monoxide and carbon tetrachloride Source EPO TRACKING AND DATA RELAY SATELLITE SYSTEM TDRSS A constellation of NASA satellites and ground stations that track and relay data to and from low altitude Earth orbiting satellites including the Space Shuttle This NASA system includes specialized communications satellites located in geosynchronous orbit both east and west of the continental U S providing coverage of virtually the whole globe and a TDRSS Ground Terminal at White Sands New Mexico Beginning in 1995P96 redundant Ground Terminals are scheduled to be in place at White Sands Source EPO TROPOPAUSE Boundary between the upper troposphere and the lower stratosphere that varies in altitude between approximately 8 km at the poles to 18 km at the equator Source EPO TROPOSPHERE Lowest atmospheric layer between the surface and tropopause Source EPO UPWELLING The vertical motion of water in the ocean by which subsurface water of lower temperature and greater density moves toward the surface of the ocean Upwelling occurs most commonly along the western coastlines of continents but may occur anywhere in the ocean Upwelling results when winds blowing nearly parallel to a continental coastline transport the light surface water away from the coast Subsurface water of greater density and lower temperature replaces the surface water and exerts a considerable influence on the weather of coastal regions Carbon dioxide is transferred to the atmosphere in regions of upwelling This is especially important in the Pacific equatorial regions where 1 to 2 gigatons of carbon per year may be released to the atmosphere Upwelling also re sults in increased ocean productivity by transporting nutrient rich waters to the surface layer of the ocean Source EPO USER Any person accessing the EOSDIS AUTHORIZED USERS are users who have viable EOSDIS accounts and who may therefore make EOSDIS data requests These users may be Affiliated or Unaffiliated AFFILIATED USERS are those who are sponsored by one of the parties to the Earth Observations ICWG EO ICWG data policy Each party is responsible for ensuring that all its affiliated users comply with the EO ICWG data policy Use of data by Affiliated Users is classified in one of three categories defined in the EO ICWG data policy Source EPO Research Use A study or an investigation in which the user affirms 1 the aim is to establish facts or principles 2 the data will not be sold or reproduced or provided to anyone not covered by this or another valid affirmation 3 the results of the research will be submitted for publication in the scientific literature and 4 detailed results of the research will be provided to the sponsoring spacecraft operator as agreed between the researcher and the sponsoring spacecraft operator In the context of EOSDIS this means that NASA affiliated users must make available to the research community their detailed results including data algorithms and models at the time their research is accepted for publication and that the data may be copied and shared among other researchers provided that either they are covered by a research agreement or the researcher who obtained the data from EOSDIS is willing to take responsibility for their compliance with the agreement Data for affiliated users and for research and applications use will be made available at no more than the marginal cost of production and distribution Environmental Monitoring and Operational Use Includes data use by those government agencies affiliated with the parties which conduct environmental mon itoring and or operational observations for the public good and can include larger agencies to which the parties belong i e the World Meteorological Organization or national agencies or their designates in volved in other operational forecasting activities which are conducted for the public good i e weather sea state sea ice agriculture hydrology etc Environmental Monitoring and Operational Use of Data constitutes any use of data to carry out a mandate of environmental observation and prediction as part of an agency s responsibilities to provide for the general welfare Such use may include the routine downlink or direct broadcast of enhanced and unenhanced data in
