Service Charleston SC What is Skywarn SKYWARN is a voluntary program developed by the National Weather Service to improve the warning program SKYWARN volunteers serve as storm spotters for the National Weather Service and local emergency management programs Keeping their eyes on the sky volunteers serve as the eyes and ears for the whole community SKYWARN volunteers come from all walks of life but they all have generally two things in common an interest in the weather and an interest in serving their community SKYWARN is a loosely knit organization Training in severe storm identification comes from the National Weather Service Often another organization such as emergency management law enforcement fire departments or rescue squads or amateur radio groups is the backbone of the SKYWARN effort in a particular community If you are interested in becoming a SKYWARN volunteer your best bet is to begin with the local emergency management agency in your county The National Weather Service needs real time reports of hail size wind damage flash flooding heavy rain and tornado development in order to effectively warn the public Even as new technology allows the National Weather Service to issue warnings with more lead time spotters will always be needed as links between radar indications of severe weather and ground truth information Skywarn Operations on 2 meters The Skywarn program at NWS Charleston will utilize the vast 2 meter amateur radio network across southeast South Carolina and adjacent southeast Georgia to obtain severe weather reports In the event of severe weather and at the discretion of the forecaster in charge a net controller will be called in to initiate a severe weather net Although this will occur primarily with large outbreaks sometimes reports will be solicited for smaller less organized weather events In case of severe weather NWS Charleston will monitor the following repeaters South Carolina 146 790 MHz Mt Pleasant Charleston County If this repeater is not available the next two backups are 1 146 910 MHz White Hall Colleton County and 2 147 300 MHz Awendaw Charleston County Georgia 147 105 MHz Pembroke Bryan County If this repeater is not available the backup is 146 700 MHz Savannah Chatham County When a severe weather net is activated the call sign for NWS Charleston is WX4CHS When calling net control simply call Charleston Weather Ham radio storm report txt You may print off a copy of our severe weather report form by clicking here Lowcountry Skywarn Net All amateurs are cordially invited to check in to the Lowcountry Skywarn Net the first and third Tuesday of the month at 8 pm on the 146 940 repeater which carries a tone of 123 0 The net is sponsored by the National Weather Service in Charleston The purpose is to practice calling a Skywarn net and to encourage hams to relay weather information to the National Weather Service in Charleston if a net is activated If severe weather is occurring or imminent at the weekly net time the net will be cancelled for that week You do not have to be a trained weather spotter to participate You ll be asked your name callsign spotter number if you have one location and a brief description of current weather conditions at your location A short training topic relating to severe weather or amateur radio operations will be covered We look forward to hearing from you SKYWARN Recognition Day The 5th annual Skywarn Recognition Day is scheduled from 7pm Friday December 5th to 7pm Saturday December 6th This event sponsored by the American Radio Relay League ARRL celebrates the contributions hams make to the National Weather Service During the 24 hour period Skywarn operators visit National Weather Service offices and contact other radio operators across the world on many different frequencies The Charleston office will participate again this year with the callsign WX4CHS We ll be working most of the major bands so if you hear us please check in 73s For details about SRD please click on the Skywarn Recognition Day link in the Cool Links section at the bottom of this page What kind of severe weather reports are we looking for Specifically 1 Tornadoes waterspouts funnel clouds or rotating wall clouds 2 Hail ANY size 3 Estimated or measured wind speeds of 50 mph or greater 4 Flooding 5 Rainfall amounts greater than 1 inch per hour 6 Damage by wind or lightning 7 Downed trees and or power lines When reporting any of these events it s very important to tell us WHEN and WHERE they occurred If it s a second or third hand report please give us the source of the original report along with all the applicable information in 1 7 above Severe Weather Net Procedures The success of a severe weather net depends on everyone using discretion with their microphones Please do NOT transmit unless it is absolutely necessary Ragchewing little side comments and personal transmissions are not to be made Please do NOT transmit to report general weather information for example it s raining hard I see lots of lightning off to the west the clouds are getting darker it s thundering etc Traffic of this nature is of no real use to the net It only ties up the repeater and may prevent someone with severe weather to report from getting through Think before you transmit Just listening and calling when you have severe weather to report is the best help you can provide a severe weather net It is not the intent of the net to provide the latest conditions and forecasts The net is set up to receive reports not give them Please remember that in order for the net to be successful in its true purpose Helpful Information for Spotters Hail Size Comparisons 0 25 inch Pea size 0 75 inch Penny 0 88 inch Nickel 1 00 inch Quarter 1 25 inches Half dollar 1 50 inches Ping pong ball or Walnut 1 75 inches Golfball 2 00 inches Hen s egg 2 50 inches Tennis ball 2 75 inches Baseball 3 00 inches Teacup 4 00 inches Grapefruit 4 50 inches Softball Please do not use the term marble size as it leads to confusion because marbles come in different sizes If hail is smaller than dime size simply report it that way Estimating Wind Speed 25 31 mph Large branches in motion whistling heard in telephone wires and power lines 32 38 mph Whole trees in motion inconvenience felt walking in the wind 39 55 mph Twigs break off trees wind generally impedes progress Severe Category 56 72 mph Damage to chimneys and TV antennas pushes over shallow rooted trees 73 112 mph Peels surface off roofs windows broken mobile homes pushed or
