1 and must be returned by August 31st To meet the primary mission of the McLean County Department of Parks and Recreation management of natural resources within the Parks is necessary Today due to the lack of natural predators natural resource management of white tail deer herds is necessary to insure and improve natural habitat overall The use of public hunting at COMLARA Park Evergreen Lake is recognized as an appropriate population control method In addition public hunting provides recreational and leisure opportunities for those that wish to participate Deer Populations Research has documented populations at COMLARA County Park in excess of 60 deer per square mile The ecological carrying capacity of various natural environments is 15 to 20 deer per square mile Without active management the number of deer will continue to increase possibly dramatically The deer population levels threaten natural re generation and environmental reclamation projects due to browse levels
