Report to Industry on the 2003 Eastern Bering Sea Trawl Survey Numbers presented are trawl survey indices of population level and do not necessarily represent absolute abundance For further

GHLs are for the combined general and CDQ fisheries This report reflects data analysis and management decision making through September 25 2003 Red king crab Paralithodes camtschaticus charts ch2003rk htm 2003 red king distribution chart Bristol Bay District Legal males 12 3 million crabs 30 increase Pre recruits 9 0 million crabs 8 decrease Large Females 34 0 million crabs 76 increase Status The abundance of legal males increased while that of pre recruit males decreased slightly This may indicate declining legal abundance for 2004 The apparent abundance of mature females increased but this may be more of a reflection of instability in the estimates than any true increase in stock size High numbers of sub legal crab in 2002 evidently produced good recruitment to the 2003 legal stock Almost all newshell females carried new eggs Reproductive stock estimates were above the minimum stock size threshold MSST due largely to this apparent increase in female abundance The stock is above the overfished level of abundance defined in the plan although it remains substantially below the peak populations of the 1970 s GHL 15 7 million pounds 7 100 metric tons t Fishery opened 15 October 2003 Pribilof District Legal males 1 3 million crabs 26 decrease Pre recruits 0 1 million crabs no real change Large Females 1 1 million crabs percent change difficult to detect Status Crabs are highly concentrated and indices have very low precision Females are particularly poorly estimated Since reproductive stock estimates are above the MSST defined in the plan the stock is not considered to be overfished No recruitment is apparent Red king crabs in the Pribilof Islands are usually harvested with blue king crabs and are currently the dominant species A principal concern is that an unacceptable levels of blue king crab incidental catch could occur in a red king crab fishery GHL Fishery will not open in 2003 Blue king crab Paralithodes platypus charts ch2003bk htm 2003 blue king distribution chart Pribilof Islands District Legal males 0 2 million crabs no real change Pre recruits 0 1million crabs no real change Large Females 1 1million crabs 11 decrease Status Population abundance is low and trends are not easily detectable Little or no recruitment is apparent The reproductive stock estimate fell below the MSST in 2002 and remains so in 2003 This stock is considered to be overfished A rebuilding plan was submitted to the Council in October 2003 GHL Fishery will not open in 2003 Northern St Matthew Island District Legal males 0 6 million crabs no real change Pre recruits 0 3 million crabs 47 increase Large Females 0 8 million crabs 600 increase Not well estimated Status Indices of abundance are affected by the portion of the stock occupying untrawlable grounds The population declined steeply in 1999 falling below the MSST defined in the plan The reproductive stock estimate rose slightly above the MSST in 2003 The stock has been considered overfished since 1999 but may be showing signs of recovery However this is clouded by extreme uncertainty in the estimate of female abundance The 2003 abundance of mature males was below the threshold for opening the fishery GHL Fishery will not open in 2003 Tanner crab Chionoecetes bairdi charts ch2003cb htm 2003 Tanner crab distribution chart Eastern District Legal males 7 4 million crabs 6 increase Pre recruits 24 7 million crabs 62 increase Large Females 15 1 million crabs 44 increase Status The 2003 population estimates demonstrate increasing trends in male and female abundance The veracity of these increases is uncertain and unsupported by modes in size frequencies seen in 2001 and 2002 The reproductive stock estimate was below the MSST for the previous 6 years 1997 2002 and just barely above the MSST in 2003 The mature female biomass is still below the threshold value of 21 million pounds defined in the plan GHL Fishery will not open in 2003 Snow crab C opilio charts ch2003co htm 2003 snow crab distribution chart All districts combined Large males 65 2 million crabs 16 decrease Pre recruits 166 5 million crabs 34 decrease Large Females 614 0 million crabs 20 increase Status Large and pre recruit males abundances continue to decline through 2003 while that for large females increased slightly The decline in total mature biomass was less severe than indicated by declining male abundance as it was partially offset by increased mature female biomass The abundances for small males and females remain well below a 20 year average Total mature biomass which slightly exceeded the MSST in 2001 was well below this threshold in 2002 and 2003 Recruitment reached a dramatic and historical low in 1994 and remains exceedingly low through 2003 Future outlook for this stock is poor The stock is considered to be overfished Under the current rebuilding plan and harvest strategy the fishery would be closed if the stock continues to decline and falls below one half of the MSST GHL 20 8 million pounds 9 400 t Fishery is currently scheduled to open 15 January 2004 Hair crab Erimacrus isenbeckii charts ch2003ei htm 2003 hair crab distribution chart All districts combined Total males 1 0 million crabs 52 decrease Large Females 0 2 million crabs 65 decrease Not well estimated Status The population has been declining for several years Recruitment trends are unclear due to poor representation of small crabs in the survey GHL Fishery will not open in 2003 crabsurvey htm Back to options http www afsc noaa gov race default htm RACE Home http www afsc noaa gov race media
