covered by the MPA that are not seeking approval for their own FWA Therefore if you elect to replace your MPA with an FWA please ensure that these processes are completed before filing the FWA MPA institutions were grandparented into the IRB IEC Registration system on 12 04 2000 and assigned IRB Organization IORG numbers and each IRB was assigned a unique IRB identifier Some MPA institutions have subsequently completed their IRB Registration form however most have not If you are an MPA institution filing an FWA and you have not completed an IRB Registration form you should submit it

regarding the new version of the Federalwide Assurance FWA that was posted on the OHRP website on March 20 2002 At this time we would like to respond to some of these questions Information regarding the posting of the FWA is available at irbasur htm http ohrp osophs dhhs gov irbasur htm The answers to some specific questions raised on the IRBForum follow 1 Why has OHRP revised the FWA OHRP originally placed the FWA on its website in December 2000 for public comment and has revised the forms in accordance with those comments and to accommodate suggestions made by other Federal Departments and Agencies that support human subjects research 2 Why is OHRP now taking public comment on the FWA Does this mean that the FWA is still undergoing revisions Further public comment is sought in accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act Because the forms have been modified in accordance with public comment and to meet concerns raised by other Federal Agencies OHRP does not anticipate further significant changes to the forms 3 What is the status of FWA s issued up to today s date Are they effective What if they do not incorporate items in the revised FWA published today FWAs submitted and approved prior to March 21 2002 will be considered effective by OHRP Furthermore FWAs using the December 2000 version submitted to OHRP and pending approval will be processed by OHRP The new FWA does not change the regulatory requirements nor an institution s commitment to the federal regulations from what was provided in the original FWA 4 Given that OHRP is taking public comment on the FWA should institutions continue to apply for an FWA or wait until a final FWA is published on the website The FWA is posted for public comment If institutions choose to submit an FWA while comment is being sought and OMB approval is pending OHRP will accept that submission 5 It would be helpful to those of us in the field who work with investigators on FWA applications for OHRP to post an outline of the differences and changes between the old FWA and the revised FWA OHRP is preparing a document that will provide a comparison of the old and new FWA as well as answers to frequently asked questions and will provide these on its website in the near future March 26 2002 FDA Seeks Comment on Whether to Require Sponsors and Investigators to Inform Institutional Review Boards IRBs of Any Prior IRB Reviews The Food and Drug Administration FDA on Wednesday March 6 published in the Federal Register an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking seeking information on IRB practices to determine whether to draft a regulation to require sponsors and investigators to inform IRBs about any prior IRB review decisions According to the Notice These disclosures could help ensure that sponsors and clinical investigators who submit protocols to more than one IRB will not be able to ignore an unfavorable IRB review decision and that IRBs reviewing a protocol will be aware of what other IRBs reviewing similar protocols have concluded The DHHS Office of Inspector General recommended this requirement in a 1998 report in an effort to curb IRB shopping Comments on the notice are due by June 4 2002 If after reviewing comments submitted in response to the Notice FDA determines that it is appropriate to draft regulations it would seek additional comment on the draft before issuing any new regulations The notice is available under the FDA heading at http www access gpo gov su docs fedreg a020306c html http www access gpo gov su docs fedreg a020306c html March 21
