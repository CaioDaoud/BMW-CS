The extreme rainfall that occurred in the Pacific watershed of Honduras in conjunction with wind caused destruction of vegetated surfaces led to numerous landslides debris flows and downstream flooding In many areas flood waters changed courses of natural distributaries entering the Gulf New accretion and redistribution of deltaic sediments filled some mariculture pond impoundments and buried productive mangrove forests and other vegetated natural substrates that formerly supported shrimp postlarvae and other estuarine dependent invertebrates and fishes of commercial and ecological importance The burial and subsequent decomposition of these organic rich substrates leads to sediment hypoxia and the release of highly reduced compounds including toxins such as sulfides Despite physical restoration e g pond dredging the restoration of soil structure porewater and nutrient status will take a long time Furthermore contaminants that were deposited in the Gulf as a result of the floods may leach over time resulting in further chronic impacts to water quality Much of the country s economic activities rely on a the maintenance of water quality and a productive coastal environment Proceeds from shrimp mariculture coastal fisheries and eco tourism constitute about two thirds of the Honduran economy Water quality problems have been both directly and indirectly associated with declines in world shrimp production In the Gulf of Fonseca native post larval shrimp populations are harvested to supply stock to the mariculture ponds Therefore water quality related declines in native shrimp populations would directly impact the shrimp mariculture industry Water quality problems would also affect a large coastal population which depends on near shore fishing for subsistence Water quality is highly dependent on spatial and temporal circulation patterns within the Gulf Low residence time of water within the system means that pollutants such as high nutrient concentrations do not have the chance to interact significantly with the water column High residence times on the other hand means that pollutants will have a greater likelihood of causing negative impacts to the water the benthos and associated organisms Seasonal patterns of rainfall wet and dry seasons within the watershed lead to changes in hydrology which can lead to temporal changes in sensitivity to pollution events The evaluation of water quality and water circulation patterns within the Gulf of Fonseca and their associations with shrimp culture is necessary to estimate the post hurricane assimilative capacities of this ecosystem This information can then be used to develop sustainable management techniques that would minimize environmental impact from shrimp mariculture activites Objectives 1 Monitor post hurricane water quality in estuaries within the Gulf of Fonseca 2 Obtain hydrographic data necessary to model spatial and temporal circulation patterns within the Gulf of Fonseca 3 Combine the water quality data and the circulation models to predict the assimilative capacities of the Gulf of Fonseca for pollutants Approach Principal Investigators Bartholomew W Green Ph D USDA ARS Lead PI George Ward Ph D University of Texas Co PI Cooperating Agencies United States Department of Agriculture University of Texas ANDAH CODDEFFAGOLF Source Data Summary datasets will be provided for the following components 1 Summary data on water quality for stations in the Gulf of Fonseca 2 Summary hydrographic data for stations in the Gulf of Fonseca 3 Output from model simulations estimating assimilative capacity of the Gulf with respect to nutrient pollution Products 1 A final report will be generated summarizing the results of the two year field water quality monitoring project Inferences will be made concerning the degree of chronic impacts to water quality related to Hurricane Mitch The water quality data will be interpreted in light of the hydrodynamic model yielding estimates of assimilative capacities of nutrient and other pollutants within the Gulf of Fonseca A synthesis will be made exploring management techniques that would maximize sustainable use within the Gulf while minimizing deleterious environmental impacts associated with this use 2 All summary data will be available as meta data within the CIGEO EROS Internet Clearinghouse Locations
