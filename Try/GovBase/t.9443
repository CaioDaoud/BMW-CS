temperature products SST at different spatial and temporal resolutions The start and stop times for these data products varies The following is a summary of information relevant to each product that should facilitate the choosing by the user of the appropriate product to meet their needs Each summary contains relevant links for more detailed information on ordering FTP access and software images clim gif The NOAA NASA Pathfinder Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer AVHRR SST product is a high quality dataset derived from the NOAA polar orbiting series of satellites that start with the NOAA 9 in 1985 This dataset represents a historical reprocessing of the entire AVHRR time series using consistent SST algorithms improved satellite and inter satellite calibration quality control and cloud detection These data is available until 2003 at daily 8 day and monthly averages and 9km 18km and 54km resolutions Data gaps occur primarily due to cloud cover because of the inability of the infrared sensor to detect ocean temperatures in these conditions Quality flag information is available that allows the user to apply various levels cloud masking strigency Or use the one provided by the algorithm team headed by Professor Robert Evans at the University of Miami Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Sciences Current plans include extending this data at a near real rate Error estimates for this dataset range from 0 3 degrees Celsius to 0 5 degrees Celsius Further information and documentation on this data product is available through http podaac jpl nasa gov sst http podaac jpl nasa gov sst A Pathfinder derived 9km 5 day pentad JPL derived climatology along with the NSIPP Casey Cornillon pentad and monthly climatologies are available that allows the user to apply a high resolution climatology suitable for climate studies Both these climatologies are derived from the Pathfinder dataset with more information available through http podaac jpl nasa gov climatology http podaac jpl nasa gov climatology The multichannel sea surface temperature MCSST product is available from January of 1981 through January of 2001 Like the Pathfinder 18km SST this dataset is distributed at a spatial resolution of 18km at weekly time periods In general the number of retrievals in this data is less than the Pathfinder product because of the improved cloud detection used in the Pathfinder algorithm The MCSST data are derived from the same series of NOAA polar orbiting satellites as the Pathfinder data but covers images mcsst gif the additional time period of the NOAA 7 satellite 1981 1984 Error estimates for this dataset are around 0 5 0 7 degrees Celsius More information on this data can be derived from http podaac jpl nasa gov mcsst http podaac jpl nasa gov mcsst A continuation of the MCSST data starting in August of 2001 is produced at a near real time rate by the Naval Oceanographic Office NAVOCEANO This product is available as both a Level 2 with a time lag f only a few hours from acquisition and a Level 3 global products The Level 3 dataset is gridded at a resolution of 18km and 7 day time periods and available at a one week lag from data acquisition The Level 3 dataset includes SST Anomaly images navo mcsst gif based on the Reynolds 1 degree SST Climatology T number of observations used in a given bin and interpolated SST using a Gaussian weighting The advantage of this data is its near real time distribution along with the interpolated SST Error estimates are around 0 7deg Celsius More information may be found at http podaac jpl nasa

the regions covered include the East and West coasts of the United States the Mediterranean parts of the Indian Ocean and the Australian Coasts Regions other than the East and West Coast of the US are variable The SSTs are available at a lag of only a few hours from data acquisition More information on this dataset may be found under http podaac jpl nasa gov hrpt lac http podaac jpl nasa gov hrpt

thermal infrared remote sensing Data are currently available globally at 4 km 36 km and 1 degree resolutions with daily weekly and monthly time intervals in HDF EOS files These data are the latest science quality Level 3 files processed by the Modis Adaptive Processing System MODAPS and distributed by the Goddard Distributed Active Archive Center GDAAC located at the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center PO DAAC is acting as a mirror site for Level 3 MODIS http modis ocean gsfc nasa gov ocean SST products javascript display3 SST Images The National Center for Environmental Prediction NCEP Reynolds Optimally Interpolated OI Sea Surface Temperature product consists of weekly and monthly global sea surface temperature fields since 1981 gridded at a 1 degree by 1 degree resolution Also available on a 2 degree by 2 degree grid based on situ data prior to 1981 from 1950 to 1998 are the reconstructed SST fields These datasets have the images reynolds gif advantage that an interpolation of satellite derived AVHRR and in situ measurements of SST are combined to create an SST globally gridded product with no data gaps More information on this product along with derived climatologies

the 3 infrared 1 near infrared and 3 visible channels on board the European Remote Sensing ERS 2 satellite Three months of gridded 512x512 1 km swath data are available for April May June of 1997 along with three days of data for July 21 22 and 23 of 1996 and January 28 29 and 30 of 1999 Links are also provided to ATSR product sites for information on ordering and the availability of other
