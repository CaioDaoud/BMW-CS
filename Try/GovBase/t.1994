Executive Director s Report EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR S REPORT TO THE COMMISSION MEETING OF NOVEMBER 19 2003 SUMMARY OF EVENTS AMPO Annual Meeting Washington DC October 22 25 Chair Kinsey and I attended the annual meeting of the Association of Metropolitan Planning Organizations I participated in a panel discussion on operational programs like MTC s TransLink and 511 services Commissioner Kinsey moderated another panel discussion and attended a Board of Directors meeting as well Commission Workshop Redwood City and San Francisco October 29 30 On behalf of staff I d again like to thank all those commissioners who participated in this two day workshop focused principally on key decisions for the long range Transportation 2030 Plan The discussion provided excellent direction to staff as we head towards Commission action on these issues in December GAO Visit on Homeland Security Oakland October 31 Jeff Georgevich Nancy Okasaki and I hosted a visit by analysts from the General Accounting Office who are investigating whether MPOs might have a more prominent role to play in implementing federal homeland security strategies Federal Certification Report Sacramento October 31 We have received the final report from the Federal Highway and Transit Administrations recertifying MTC as the Bay Area s metropolitan planning organization for another three years Although the report contains several recommendations for improvement it does not include any corrective actions as was the case three years ago EPA Proposes Attainment Status for Bay Area San Francisco October 31 Based on air quality monitoring data from 2001 2003 EPA has proposed to determine that the Bay Area has attained the 1 hour ozone standard If finalized after a 30 day public comment period in the Federal Register this action is likely to relieve the Air District MTC and ABAG of most of the planning requirements previously scheduled for completion by April 2004 with the mid course review of the 2001 Federal Ozone Plan Since the region would remain formally designated as a non attainment area however we would remain eligible for CMAQ funding under the federal highway program The next major action from EPA is expected in Spring 2004 when the agency is due to finalize its designations of areas under the new 8 hour ozone standard It is unclear what designation the Bay Area will receive under the new standard which we are also quite close to attaining according to the monitoring record In related news MTC has informed Judge Thelton Henderson in our latest quarterly report that we are unlikely to meet the target of a 15 increase in transit ridership by the November 2006 deadline established in his TCM 2 order As you may recall at the height of the recent economic boom in 2001 transit ridership was 12 5 above the 1982 baseline in TCM 2 Due to the continued downturn in the region s economy and other factors beyond our control transit ridership as of June 2003 was down to just 1 2 above the baseline The ridership declines were largest among the agencies that serve the most economically depressed counties on the San Francisco peninsula Given this latest ridership information MTC s options have narrowed either to overturning Judge Henderson s ruling on appeal or substituting TCM 2 in the clean air plan with another measure promising equivalent emission reductions US DOT ECMT Conference on Sustainability Washington DC November 5 6 I made a presentation on our Housing Incentive Program at an international conference co sponsored by the U S Department of Transportation and the European Conference of Ministers of Transport While in Washington Tom Bulger and I visited with Representatives Ellen Tauscher and Mike Honda regarding TEA 21 reauthorization issues Bay Area Partnership Board Oakland November 7 The Partnership devoted its entire meeting to the three major issues in the Transportation 2030 Plan discussed by the Commission at its October workshop new goals and objectives the transportation land use connection and how to balance prior funding commitments with new investments The Planning and Operations Committee co hosted with the Congestion Management Agencies a well attended public outreach session on the same topics on November 13th Carquinez Bridge Opening Crockett November 8 Governor Gray Davis led a parade of dignitaries at the grand opening ceremonies for the new Alfred Zampa Memorial Bridge The day featured plenty of speeches including by MTC Chair Steve Kinsey a bridge walk and fireworks later in the evening Several MTC commissioners and staff were joined by former colleagues such as Sharon Brown Larry Dahms and Bill Hein in celebrating the event The bridge opened to traffic the following week but there are still several construction tasks left to complete including the bicycle pedestrian path on the main span the Crockett interchange and demolition of the adjacent 1927 span that the new bridge replaced Senate Committee Approves TEA 21 Reauthorization Bill Washington November 12 The Senate Environment and Public Works Committee approved by a 17 2 vote a bill reauthorizing the highway title of TEA 21 The bill closely mirrors the Bush Administration s SAFETEA reauthorization proposal although it would be funded at a higher level of 255 billion for highway programs over the next six years Other notable provisions in the Senate bill of interest to MTC include several streamlining changes to the transportation planning and conformity process and an increase from 1 to 1 5 in the amount of total highway funds set aside for metropolitan planning The Senate is not expected to take any further action on either the highway or transit titles the latter of which falls under jurisdiction of the Senate Banking Committee of SAFETEA until it returns from its holiday recess in January 2004 Meanwhile the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee is scheduled to release its 375 billion draft of TEA 21 reauthorization legislation on Wednesday November 19 The House committee is not expected to mark up its bill until after the holiday recess Both houses of Congress are working to complete action on reauthorization legislation by February 29 2004 when the five month extension of TEA 21 expires It is still unclear how either the Senate or House committees will find the revenue to pay for these higher authorized funding levels Solano Transportation Awards Suisun City November 12 Ann Flemer represented us at the Solano Transportation Authority s annual awards program where MTC received a special award for the new T PLUS program to assist the congestion management agencies in transportation and land use planning activities Bay Planning Coalition Oakland November 13 I served as the
