sponsoring the symposium entitled Knowledge Based Authentication Is it Quantifiable on February 9 10 2004 in Gaithersburg Maryland Knowledge Based Authentication KBA is a useful tool to remotely authenticate individuals who conduct business electronically with Federal agencies or businesses infrequently However the complexity and interdependencies of KBA solutions used to establish a remote user identity is difficult to quantify This symposium will explore KBA through panel discussions of user requirements KBA system models and metrics to quantify information sources questions for

operating today s complex systems is challenging and demanding Mission and operational requirements to deliver services and applications swiftly and securely have never been greater Organizations having invested precious resources and scarce skills in various necessary security efforts such as risk analysis certification accreditation security architectures policy development and other security efforts can be tempted to neglect or insufficiently develop a comprehensive and systematic operational security testing program This guide stresses the need for an effective security testing program within federal agencies Testing serves several purposes One no matter how well a given system may have been developed the nature of today s complex systems with large volumes of code complex internal interactions interoperability with external components unknown interdependencies coupled with vendor cost and schedule pressures means that exploitable flaws will always be present and will surface over time Accordingly security testing must fill the gap between the state of system development as it is and actual operation of these systems Two security testing is important for understanding calibrating and documenting the operational publications nistbul index html Continued at ITL Bulletins page see complete list of all Computer Security ITL Bulletins http www nist gov go
