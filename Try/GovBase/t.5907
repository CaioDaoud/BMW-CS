employees have the right and responsibility to report environmental safety and health concerns arising from the operation or conduct of DOE facilities and activities A variety of mechanisms and organizations have been established for dealing with such concerns at DOE sites This page serves as a roadmap and provides links to these different organizations The overall process for dealing with employee concerns is described in DOE Order 442 1A Department of Energy Employee Concerns Program As a general rule DOE encourages employees to report and seek resolution of safety and health concerns at the level closest to and with immediate responsibility for the concern This is typically the employee s supervisor or the supervisor with responsibility for the area concern Additional contacts include higher levels of management local employee concern programs or union representatives For instances where concerns are not satisfactorily addressed at the local level employees can report their concerns to several established programs at the DOE Headquarters level DOE requirements also prohibit retaliation against DOE or contractor employees for raising environmental safety or health concerns related to DOE activities or operations Verified instances of reprisal against contractor employees for reporting concerns related to nuclear safety matters are also potentially subject to the imposition of penalties under the Price Anderson Amendments Act of 1988 IF YOU HAVE AN ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY OR HEALTH CONCERN ARISING FROM THE OPERATION OR CONDUCT OF A DOE FACILITY OR ACTIVITY
