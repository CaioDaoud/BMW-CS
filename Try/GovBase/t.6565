literacy as an individual s ability to read write speak in English compute and solve problems at levels of proficiency necessary to function on the job in the family of the individual and in society This is a broader view of literacy than just an individual s ability to read the more traditional concept of literacy As information and technology have increasingly shaped our society the skills we need to function successfully have gone beyond reading and literacy has come to include the skills listed in the current definition How is adult literacy measured When literacy was simply a synonym for reading skill it was typically measured in grade level equivalents In other words an adult s literacy skill was described as equivalent to reading at a grade in the kindergarten 12th grade system A more complex more realistic conception of literacy that emphasizes its uses in adult activities helped create momentum for new forms of literacy measurement To determine the literacy skills of American adults the http nces ed gov naal resources execsumm asp 1992 National Adult Literacy Survey NALS used test items that resembled everyday life tasks involving prose document and quantitative skills The NALS classified the results into five levels that are now commonly used to describe adults literacy skills Almost all adults in Level 1 can read a little but not well enough to fill out an application read a food label or read a simple story to a child Adults in Level 2 usually can perform more complex tasks such as comparing contrasting or integrating pieces of information but usually not higher level reading and problem solving skills Adults in levels 3 through 5 usually can perform the same types of more complex tasks on increasingly lengthy and dense texts and documents In 2002 the http nces ed gov naal resources execsumm asp National Assessment of Adult Literacy will give us new information How literate is the adult population Very few adults in the US are truly illiterate Rather there are many adults with low literacy skills who lack the foundation they need to find and keep decent jobs support their children s education and participate actively in civic life Between 21 and 23 percent of the adult population or approximately 44 million people according to the National Adult Literacy Survey NALS scored in Level 1 see description above Another 25 28 percent of the adult population or between 45 and 50 million people scored in Level 2 Literacy experts believe that adults with skills at Levels 1 and 2 lack a sufficient foundation of basic skills to function successfully in our society Many factors help to explain the relatively large number of adults in Level 1 Twenty five percent of adults in Level 1 were immigrants who may have just been learning to speak English More than 60 percent didn t complete high school More than 30 percent were over 65 More than 25 percent had physical or mental conditions that kept them from fully participating in work school housework or other activities and almost 20 percent had vision problems that affected their ability to read print For more facts and statistics visit the NIFL nifl facts facts overview html
