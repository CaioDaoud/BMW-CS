software liaisons we are scheduling the upgrade for Thursday Dec 4 beginning at 10 am EST In preparation for the kernel upgrade we will disable Condor LSF Wednesday Dec 3 evening around 11 pm to

EST 2003 I will be replacing a faulting switch router module on the main RCF ACF switch this morning with a spare There will be an interruption to routing service between the Jumbo subnets for a few minutes and an interruption of assorted switching of 30 sec Terry thealy bnl gov Week of Mon Nov 24 Phenix reboot of NFS servers today 10 30am 11 26 2003 Wed Nov 26 10 01 49 EST 2003 several linux machines have crashed over the last few days when trying to access nfs filesystems there is a possibility that this is related to the network problems that occurred last week which might have left the servers in an unstable operating mode in an effort to provide the best operating environment over the long weekend i intend on restarting the phenix servers this should interrupt but not kill existing processing between 10 30 and 11am today the nfs filesystems will go offline for between 2 4 minutes each maurice USAtlas AFS Cell back on line 11 25 2003 Tue Nov 25 12 25 46 EST 2003 The salvager process on aafs04 has completed and looks like all afs areas are now back on line Please report any problem either by submitting a CTS ticket or directly to me at edward bnl gov We are sorry for this unfortunate accident and the ensuing disruption it has caused to the review meeting Edward USATLAS AFS Cell is recovering from a double disk failure 11 25 2003 Tue Nov 25 11 27 58 EST 2003 Following the double disk failures this morning on the aafs04 raid storage one disk could be recovered The data on the failed disk is currently being reconstructed on the hot spare Running in parallel with this process is the afs salvager which is attempting to repair damaged afs file systems At present there is considerable slowlyness noticed in the salvager run which is most probably caused by the other process trying to reconstruct the data on the hot spare As of 11 25am a bit more than half of all aafs04 storage has been salvaged and at the current speeed we expect to see the process completing sometime around 12 30pm or earlier We will post an announcement as soon as all data is fixed and returned on line Edward Week of Mon Nov 17 RCF ACF Network 11 21 2003 Fri Nov 21 11 25 46 EST 2003 It is likely that I will have to reset one or more of the RCF ACF switches routers in order to attempt to clear some bizarre and persistant routing problems Unless Cisco delivers a cure before noon expect to see interruption of one or more subnets between 12 and 1 pm EST today Sorry Terry thealy bnl gov BNL USATLAS CAS Farm Kernel OpenAFS Upgrade 11 19 2003 Wed Nov 19 17 54 03 EST 2003 Due to
