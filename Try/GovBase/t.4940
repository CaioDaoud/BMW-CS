Guidelines for Fishery Management Plans published by the National Marine Fisheries Service require that a stock assessment and fishery evaluation SAFE report be prepared and reviewed annually for each fishery management plan The SAFE reports are intended to summarize the best scientific information concerning the past present and possible future conditions of the stocks marine ecosystems and

million metric tons t a retained catch of 2 0 million t an exvessel value of 566 million and a value after primary processing of approximately 1 5 billion in the year 2002 The groundfish fisheries accounted for the largest share 58 of the exvessel value of all commercial fisheries off Alaska in 2002 while the shellfish fishery with an exvessel value of 149 million displaced salmon for the second largest share 15 of the total Alaska exvessel value The value of the Pacific salmon catch amounted to 130 million or 13 of the total for Alaska Publications techmemos htm New Tech Memos

gov Russian Shipwreck Found in Alaska underwater photo of part of the wreckage of the Russian sailing ship Kad yak Dr Bradley Stevens of the Center s Kodiak Laboratory led a team of volunteer divers to discover the wreckage of the Russian sailing ship Kad yak which sank in Alaskan waters in 1860 Working on his own time Dr Stevens used translations of old Russian documents to help him estimate the ship s position Using a magnetometer the divers located the wreckage in two days roughly 100 meters from its estimated position The Kad yak is historically significant because it is the only shipwreck from the Russian colonial period ever discovered in Alaska and also the oldest known shipwreck in Alaska http www afsc noaa gov refm reem Seabirds Default htm Seabird Fishery Interaction Research flock of seabirds The Resource Ecology and Ecosystem Modeling Program is increasing its research emphasis on seabird fishery interactions and incorporating seabirds into ecosystems models being developed for the Bering Sea and Gulf of Alaska Research priorities include continued work to reduce longline seabird bycatch investigating the incidence of seabird interactions with trawl third wires developing options for monitoring halibut fleet seabird bycatch and developing reporting procedures to ensure the public has access to seabird bycatch rates Quick Links Select NMFS Headquarters NMFS
