of Snowmelt Runoff Model for Windows WinSRM A beta test version of The Snowmelt Runoff Model for Windows is now available for use by the general public This new version of the model includes all the functionality of the DOS version of the software and can import existing DOS SRM data files WinSRM provides more robust support for climate change modeling extensive enhancements to the model s graphical display capabilities and an integrated approach to managing data sets for a given mountain basin Support for the most recent DOS version 4 06 will continue to be available but all future development of the model will apply to the Windows platform only IMG SRC http hydrolab arsusda gov rroberts srmmanual hr bomb gif describe Description of SRM Version 4 xx http hydrolab arsusda gov

Model SRM is designed to simulate and forecast daily streamflow in mountain basins where snowmelt is a major runoff factor Beginning with Version 4 0 the model includes a method for evaluating the effect of a changed climate on the runoff regime for an entire hydrological year SRM was developed by J Martinec 1975 in small European basins Thanks to the progress of satellite remote sensing of snow cover SRM has been applied to larger and larger basins The largest basin where SRM has been applied so far is about 122000 km Runoff computations by SRM appear to be relatively easily understood To date the model has been applied by various agencies institutes and universities in about 80 basins situated in 25 different countries as listed in http hydrolab arsusda gov rroberts srmmanual srmtbl01 html Table 1 About 30 of these applications have been performed by the model developers and 70 by independent users SRM is a simple degree day model that requires remote sensing input in the form of basin or zonal snow cover extent Model variables are derived from actual observations of temperature precipitation and snow covered area Model parameters can either be derived from measurements or estimated by hydrological judgement taking into account the basin characteristics physical laws and theoretical or empirical relationships To facilitate use of SRM a microcomputer version of the program has been developed for IBM compatible personal computers The program itself features user oriented input and multiple self help screens which allow the user to select the kind of data input employed and the output products desired A HREF begin cgi bin srmhome Return to SRM s Home Page Last modified January 28 2000 Release Notes The Snowmelt Runoff Model was originally
