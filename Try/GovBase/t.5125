more serious illnesses than usual State Health Director Diana M Bont R N Dr P H today urged seniors and other individuals who are at risk for flu related complications such as pneumonia to receive a flu shot as soon as possible to safeguard their health during the flu season The flu season has arrived earlier than usual across the nation and is causing many illnesses Bont said More illnesses as well as hospitalizations and deaths can be prevented if high risk individuals receive a flu shot now The supply of vaccine is plentiful Influenza also called the flu is a respiratory infection caused by a virus Every year more than 114 000 people in the United States are hospitalized and approximately 36 000 people die because of the flu or its complications It is impossible to accurately predict in advance how severe the flu season will be However California s influenza monitoring system shows many more individuals sick with flu at this time of year than during a normal year Typically the peak of California s flu season occurs from late December through January Also in laboratory tests from across the country a greater proportion of specimens testing positive for influenza are type A H3N2 Historically A H3N2 viruses have been associated with more severe flu seasons during which higher numbers of influenza related hospitalizations and deaths have occurred Influenza viruses are changing all the time and vaccine effectiveness depends in part on the match between vaccine strains and circulating viruses Although the strain in this year s flu vaccine is somewhat different from the main circulating strain causing illness in the United States laboratory studies indicate that the vaccine should provide significant protection Bont recommended that the following individuals get vaccinated Individuals age 50 and older Adults and children with chronic medical conditions such as heart disease lung disease asthma diabetes kidney problems or blood disorders Children and adolescents age 6 months to 18 years who receive long term aspirin therapy Women who will be in the second or third trimester of pregnancy during the winter flu season Healthcare workers and caregivers who come in close contact with individuals at high risk for flu complications Infants and children ages 6 through 23 months Any other individual who does not want to get the flu The flu begins with an abrupt onset of fever muscle aches sore throat and cough that often make people sick enough to keep them in bed for several days Seniors are more likely than others to become seriously ill because as people age their immune systems don t respond as well Seniors and high risk individuals of any age also are recommended to receive the pneumococcal vaccine to protect against related bacterial illnesses Because the flu vaccine is created from inactive flu viruses it does not pose any risk of giving recipients symptoms associated with the flu noted Bont A flu shot is your best protection against the flu Bont also reminded parents to avoid giving children or adolescents who are sick with flu or fever aspirin or medications containing salicylates common ingredients in many cold medications These ingredients have been associated with the development of Reye s syndrome which can lead to coma brain damage and even death in children and teenagers suffering from the flu flu like illnesses or chickenpox To limit the spread of influenza and other respiratory illnesses Bont urged flu patients to limit their contact with others wash their hands frequently with soap and water and cover their mouth with a tissue when they cough In a letter dated Nov 25 to all California hospitals the California Department of Health Services CDHS provided additional guidelines to lessen the impact of a potential influenza outbreak Those guidelines included asking patients with respiratory symptoms to wear surgical masks segregating those patients from others and urging all healthcare workers to receive an influenza vaccination CDHS through ongoing clinics offered by California s local health departments has distributed more than 520 000 doses of influenza vaccine at low or no cost Part B Medicare beneficiaries can receive free influenza and pneumococcal shots from their health plans In addition many non traditional sites such as supermarkets and drug stores host special flu clinics To obtain influenza and pneumococcal immunizations individuals should call their medical provider or local health department o0o PageTop Back to Top of Page 2003 State of California http www
