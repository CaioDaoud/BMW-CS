News Upcoming Events Column 1 Division Overview The goal of the Life Sciences Division is to study how the unique environment of space affects living systems from cells in culture to physiological studies in animals and humans Through a better understanding of fundamental physiology will come knowledge useful for both the maintenance of human health on Earth and the development of countermeasures to the effects of long term spaceflight To meet this goal the division Conducts ground based life sciences research Implements flight experiments onboard the Shuttle the International Space Station and a variety of unmanned international orbiting vehicles Develops the technology required to perform life sciences research on the ground and in space Transfers technology and promotes education for the improvement of the quality of life on Earth Recent Publications Gravitational Research Publications pub2003 html Publications which have been produced by the Life Sciences Division
