Home Page Satellite Showcase LISA artist s concept of LISA Artist s concept of LISA shows the docs dict qz html satellite satellite in docs dict jp html orbit orbit around the Sun following about 20 degrees behind the Earth The Mission The docs dict jp html laser Laser Interferometer Space Antenna LISA is a next generation project proposed by docs dict jp html NASA NASA to detect some of the weakest and perhaps most interesting gravitational waves Gravitational waves are ripples in spacetime caused by large scale events like docs dict ei html galaxy galaxy coalescences docs dict ad html black hole black hole collisions and docs dict jp html neutron star neutron star binary systems The project uses the scientific technique of laser interferometry Three separate spacecraft form three corners of a large triangle in space Each of the three spacecraft establishes an independent orbit around the Sun trailing the Earth s orbit by about 20 degrees When a low docs dict ei html frequency frequency gravitational wave passes LISA will be able to detect slight changes in the distance between the corners of the triangle The mission is expected to launch in 2011 with a mission life of about 5 years artist s concept of laser interferometry LISA s interferometric spacecraft aim and detect laser signals that indicate passing gravitational waves Instrumentation LISA uses a scientific technique called laser interferometry Interferometry uses two or more laser arms to detect tiny fluctuations in distance Here s how it works A laser beam from one of the spacecraft is pointed toward a detector on another spacecraft 5 million kilometers away The laser beam precisely measures a distance between the two spacecraft When the distance changes an interference pattern is formed and LISA has detected a gravitational wave The three arms of the spacecraft work together to confirm each other s observations as well as get more detailed dimensional information about the passing waveform Why is LISA so big As it turns out the large distance between the detectors allows LISA to see variations smaller than the size of an atom This observatory will be very sensitive artist s concept of thrusters Thrusters help to keep LISA isolated from outside disturbances like pressure from solar docs dict qz html radiation radiation A major challenge of the mission is to isolate LISA from disturbances in space that might mimic a gravitational wave Variations in the Earth s docs dict ei html gravity gravitational field or large solar events might cause such disturbances To prevent these disturbances each of LISA s three spacecraft is equipped with micro Newton thrusters to keep the instruments steady Expected Science Results Once LISA is launched and starts to return data scientists will compare it to computer models to interpret what they see Dr Joan Centrella and her team of theoretical researchers at NASA are creating what she calls a numerical laboratory of models that represent gravitational wave phenomena Using these waveform computer codes scientists will be able to decipher LISA s message They will be able to sift through the information isolating sources of gravitational waves as well as the behaviors that cause them The scientists behind the LISA mission hope to detect information about black holes and the docs dict ad html big bang Big Bang as well as
