AMMTAP contaminants marine mammals Alaska archival Becker Thorsteinson Rowles York Porter tissue sampling storage arctic The cryogenic archival of environmental specimens for retrospective analysis can be an important resource in environmental monitoring programs and for both present and future research on population genetics pathology systematics and toxicology The Alaska Marine Mammal Tissue Archival Project AMMTAP is a joint project conducted by three U S government agencies to collect and archive tissues from Alaska marine mammals including Arctic species The project emphasizes the use of standardized sampling and archival protocols procedures that minimize contamination of samples during collection and maintaining a detailed record of sample history Most of the animals sampled are from Alaska Native subsistence harvests therefore the project requires cooperation and collaboration with numerous Alaska Native organizations and local governmental agencies Through AMMTAP samples are collected for contaminant monitoring in the Marine Mammal Health and Stranding Response Program In addition the project has provided samples and or data for several research programs both inside and outside the U S on a variety of subjects including degree of genetic separation in populations the circumpolar distribution of chlorinated hydrocarbons in beluga whales baseline levels of trace elements in tissues the identification of arsenic and mercury species in marine mammal tissues and studies on potential human health effects of Alaska Native subsidence foods The AMMTAP protocols and selected recent results are described L K Thorsteinson T K Rowles P R Becker and S A Wise Microsoft FrontPage 4 0 FrontPage Editor Document National Biomonitoring Specimen Bank NBSB Alaska Contaminant and Tissue Archival Program animals shown are black legged kittiwake thick billed murre beluga whale polar bear and walrus ammtap htm AMMTAP methods htm Methods and Materials results htm Results summary htm Summary and the Future biblio htm AMMTAP Bibliography ammtap partners htm AMMTAP Partners and Collaborators ammtap contact htm AMMTAP Contact Information stamp htm STAMP Seabird Tissue Archival and Monitoring Program colonies htm Colonies sampled for STAMP data htm Preliminary data for STAMP stamp biblio htm STAMP Bibliography stamp partners htm STAMP Partners and Collaborators stamp contact htm STAMP Contact Information nbsb htm NBSB National Biomonitoring Specimen Bank nbsb htm inventory NMMTB Tissue Sample Inventory ammtap htm AMMTAP Alaska Marine Mammal Tissue Archival Project The objectives of ammtap htm AMMTAP are to collect tissue samples from Alaska marine mammals and to store these samples under the best conditions so that they can be analyzed in the future for environmental contaminants The role of specimen banking in research and monitoring enables future investigators to extend their research into the past hind casting and provides for future verification of analytical results quality assurance stamp htm STAMP Seabird Tissue Archival and Monitoring Project The objectives of stamp htm STAMP are to collect specimens from representative Alaskan colonial seabirds suitable for determining levels of organic and inorganic contaminants and to transport catalog and archive samples in conditions that are suitable for long term storage and eventual contaminant analyses http www mms gov alaska ess http www absc usgs gov Home http www absc usgs gov research htm Research http www absc usgs gov about absc htm About ASC BSO http www absc usgs gov highlights htm Highlights http www absc usgs gov pubs Publications http www absc usgs gov dataproducts htm Data Products http www absc usgs gov staff htm Staff http www absc usgs gov jobs jobs main htm Jobs http www absc usgs gov search htm Search Last Reviewed June 11 2003
