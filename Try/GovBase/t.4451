Atmospheric Radiation Measurement Program is the largest global change research program supported by the U S Department of Energy DOE ARM scientists focus on obtaining field measurements and developing models to better understand the processes that control solar and thermal infrared radiative transfer in the atmosphere especially in clouds and at the earth s surface Forms and Reporting

typhoons and other meteorological observations Recently the Japan Meteorological Agency announced its decision to close the weather station Atmospheric scientists in Japan are proposing that the present weather station be renovated into an atmospheric environment monitoring station similar to the Mauna Loa Observatory docs news html fuji More Picture of island in Pacific Ocean docs about html
