access to government information Freedom of Information Act FOIA sets standards for determining which records must be disclosed and which records may be withheld A list of Freedom of Information Act FOIA exemptions determines which categories of information the agency may withhold However Freedom of Information Act FOIA also provides administrative and judicial remedies for those who are denied their request Most importantly Freedom of Information Act FOIA requires all federal agencies to provide you with the fullest possible disclosure of information It is our desire to assist you in obtaining this information On October 4 1993 President Clinton and Attorney General Reno established an Openness in Government initiative Among the principals of this initiative are Applying customer service attitudes toward Freedom of Information Act FOIA requesters Following the spirit as well as the letter of Freedom of Information Act FOIA Applying a presumption of disclosure in Freedom of Information Act FOIA decision making An agency should make a discretionary disclosure of exempt information whenever it is possible to do so without foreseeable harm to any interest that is protected by a Freedom of Information Act FOIA exemption An agency should withhold information under Freedom of Information Act FOIA only when it is necessary to do so What is the Privacy Act The Privacy Act of 1974 is a companion to Freedom of Information Act FOIA It allows individuals access to federal agency records about themselves It requires that personal information in agency files be accurate complete relevant and timely Additionally each agency must publish a description of each system of records maintained by the agency that contains personal information How do I make a Freedom of

to most questions you may have about the programs of the Arts Endowment You ll also find a wealth of information about the grant application path review panels and the award process You ll also find application materials and guidelines available on the web site along with lists of other Endowment publications that you can obtain through our Communications Office What types of records can be obtained from the National Endowment for the Arts NEA through Freedom of Information Act FOIA requests Here are some examples of the types of frequently requested documents which have routinely been released after redaction of exempted information such as home addresses and phone numbers and individual salaries Grant Records Grant application materials Grant award letters Successful grant applications Names of Grantee Board and staff Revised Grantee budgets Grantee staff biographies Statements of artistic intent Labor assurance forms Requests for approval of project changes Correspondence between grantees and the National Endowment for the Arts NEA Project descriptions Progress interim and final reports Agency Operations National Endowment for the Arts NEA staff lists Congressional correspondence Contract solicitations Successful contract bids Cooperative agreements Lists of panelists subsequent to the panel meeting Summary panel minutes Does Freedom of Information Act FOIA allow access to all National Endowment for the Arts NEA records No Freedom of Information Act FOIA provides nine specific exemptions that allow certain records to remain unavailable classified national defense and foreign relations information internal agency rules and practices information that is prohibited from disclosure by another law trade secrets and other confidential business information inter agency or intra agency communiocations that are protected by legal privileges information involving matters of personal privacy certain information compiled for law enforcement purposes information relating to the supervision of financial institutions geological information on wells In addition just as Freedom of Information Act FOIA provides greater public access to government documents subject only to these limited exemptions the Privacy Act prevents certain personal and financial information from being disclosed to persons other than the subject of the information What categories of information CANNOT be obtained through Freedom of Information Act FOIA The Arts Endowment may withhold information if it falls within one of the nine Freedom of Information Act FOIA exemptions The Endowment most frequently withholds information under exemptions 2 3 4 5 and 6 By far the Endowment s most frequent basis for withholding information is Freedom of Information Act FOIA exemption 6 which protects many types of personal information about grant applicants grantees and National Endowment for the Arts NEA personnel The most frequently withheld materials are Grantee proprietary information exemptions 3 and 4 such as Plans and strategies for fundraising and lists of prospective donors Records of panel deliberations Copyrighted materials such as slides and videos Internal deliberative materials exemption 5 such as Site reports Panel records Personal information of grantees and third parties exemptions 4 and 6 such as home addresses phone numbers social security numbers marital status dates and places of birth awards and amounts given to grantees from non federal third parties medical information resumes salaries Other exempted materials such as Documents that are not agency records such as personal records kept by agency employees contractors or grantees Information that is part of an ongoing investigation Attorney work product Rejected applications I would like to find out what was said about my application Can I request records and comments made at a meeting of the review panel No Internal records are kept of the meetings where applications are reviewed and voted upon However so that peers of the applicants will feel free to discuss the applications candidly it s necessary to keep all comments confidential An applicant but not a third party may request that we prepare a summary of the panel s discussion of its application Brief summary minutes of panel meetings are available for public disclosure Why can t I find out who will be serving on the panel which will vote on my application We generally will not release the names of the panelists prior to the meeting of the panel Release of panelist names prior to the panel meeting could risk a compromise in the integrity of the panel process or result in an invasion of the panelists privacy should anyone attempt to contact panelists for the purpose of influencing the panel On request we may release the panelists names after the completion of the panel review process For example an applicant might believe that one of the panelists had a conflict of interest which unfairly prejudiced their review of the application The applicant would need to know the identities of the panelists in order to make a determination on whether to seek reconsideration More information on the panel process can be obtained by accessing the directory on the National Endowment for the Arts NEA homepage Can I find out what was written about a particular project after it was subjected to an on site review Site reports are never released and are protected under the Freedom of Information Act FOIA exemptions However summary reports of panel discussions can be prepared upon request from the applicant Brief summaries of the minutes of the panels are available to the public These summaries are available to third parties only if they exist at the time of their request and if they are retained within the grant record Will I be able to tell whether a substantial amount of information has been deleted from the records I receive Yes your records will indicate that information has been deleted unless doing so would harm an interest protected by the list of Freedom of Information Act FOIA exemptions Are there fees involved in requesting documents Depending upon the type of request there are several categories of fees search review duplication computer programming computer run time and direct costs for special handling Commercial use requesters must pay all associated costs Non commercial requesters can often have their requests answered quickly and without expense However it is the burden of the requester to pay for any incurred costs The National Endowment for the Arts NEA is a federal agency and does not charge for answering Freedom of Information Act FOIA requests beyond materials and labor You must agree to pay for the costs before a record search will be done It is suggested that you indicate a maximum amount you are willing to pay for costs By doing so we can make an assessment of whether your request can be answered within your budget If not we may be able to help you narrow your search and still provide you with the information you need Private citizens and non profit organizations will be given the first 100 pages of duplication and the first two hours of search free of charge Requests from qualifying educational and scientific institutions including members of the media will be given the first 100 pages of duplication free You may be entitled to a fee waiver Requesters are entitled to a waiver or a reduction in fees if they can show that disclosing the records is in the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the regulations or activities of the government and is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester However the initial determination that the research subject is of legitimate public interest does not mandate an automatic fee waiver for follow up requests Documents sought in subsequent requests will be subject to the same scrutiny as the records for which the waiver was granted How long will I have to wait to receive the information I ve requested The 1996 Freedom of Information Act FOIA amendments also expanded the time an agency has to respond to a request from 10 days to 20 days excluding Saturday Sunday and legal public holidays effective October 2 1997 At the signing of the law President Clinton stated that this amendment recognizes that many Freedom of Information Act FOIA requests are so broad and complex that they cannot possibly be completed even within this longer period and the time spent processing them only delays other requests Accordingly this law establishes procedures for an agency to discuss with requesters ways of tailoring large requests to improve responsiveness This approach explicitly recognizes that Freedom of Information Act FOIA works best when agencies and requesters work together We are often able to respond without delay In 1998 our median Freedom of Information Act FOIA response time was 14 4 days However if for some reason your request will be delayed beyond the allotted response time you will be notified If your request is particularly broad or so complex that it can not be completed within the allotted time you may be asked to narrow your request or accept an additional delay If the document you are looking for is available on the Endowment s Website you may download it immediately What are the common reasons for delay Additional time is needed to search for documents The request is especially voluminous or complex It is necessary to consult with another agency before releasing documents Can my request be expedited Yes under certain conditions You must demonstrate a compelling need for a quicker response A compelling need can be demonstrated by showing either Failing to obtain the records within the expedited deadline poses an imminent threat to an individual s life or physical safety or The person making the request is someone who is primarily engaged in disseminating information and urgently needs the information expedited to inform the public concerning actual or alleged Federal Government activity If a delay in the response to your request would compromise a significant and recognized public interest the expedition requirement would be satisfied However a general assertion of the public s right to know will not be sufficient to expedite a request What can I do if my Freedom of Information Act FOIA request is denied If your Freedom of Information Act FOIA request is denied you have the right to appeal the denial to the head of the agency What can I appeal You may appeal a decision to withhold materials You may appeal for a waiver of fees You may contest the type or amount of fees that were charged You may appeal any other type of adverse determination How do I file a Freedom of Information Act FOIA appeal Appealing to the head of an administrative agency under Freedom of Information Act FOIA is a simple process You do not need a lawyer to help you write an appeal Your letter should identify what you are appealing and why you disagree with the agency s decision to withhold information You should be as complete as possible There is no charge for filing an administrative appeal Write to National Endowment for the Arts NEA Chairman c o Office of General Counsel National Endowment for the Arts 1100 Pennsylvania Avenue NW Room 518 Washington DC 20506 202 682 5418 202 682 5572 fax Can I keep the National Endowment for the Arts NEA from releasing information about me to someone else This situation is called a reverse Freedom of Information Act FOIA A reverse Freedom of Information Act FOIA is when someone petitions or sues the agency to prevent it from releasing specific information Unless the petitioner can show that the information in question is protected by a Freedom of Information Act FOIA exemption or would cause specific and serious harm if released the agency may choose whether or not to release the information National Endowment for the Arts mailto webmgr arts endow gov webmgr arts endow gov NEA FOIA Guidelines FOIA Reports FOIAReport02 html 2002 FOIAReport01 html
