from the structure and function of single brain cells to research on the causes prevention diagnosis and treatment of neurological disorders and most recently the translational research that is helping to bridge the gap The Institute s mission is to reduce the burden of neurological disease a burden borne by every age group by every segment of society by people all over the world I am
