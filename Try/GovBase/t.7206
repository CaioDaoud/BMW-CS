Project Management Service Sample Form January 2002 Through the FasTrac program NSA designed and implemented a new training approach that focuses on the satisfaction of education and training requirements to attain a skilled workforce throughout the Federal government Currently NSA processes all aspects of FasTrac program management to include coordinating with each FasTrac partner and service provider awarding and administrating the FasTrac contracts and providing program management and technical oversight of the computer based training offered through the program The FasTrac program has grown to the point that it is now time for NSA to shift the responsibility for contract management and funds accounting to an organization whose charter is to process this business for the Federal government at large allowing NSA to focus their attention in meeting the mission challenges of the future Effective today NSA will shift the responsibility for contract management and funds accounting for the FasTrac program to the U S Department of Treasury Franchise Business Activity FBA All other responsibilities currently managed by NSA will remain with NSA This program change will only affect new FasTrac business The FBA http www fba gov http www fba gov is an entrepreneurial government activity that has a dedicated staff of Treasury Department acquisition professionals available to serve us immediately How will this new process work The FasTrac program will still provide a subscription service library of technology based training TBT courses to satisfy Information Technology IT and Professional Business Skills training requirements for Federal government organizations supported by an interactive Learning Management System LMS FasTrac and vendor representatives will still be available to assist your organization in determining your training requirement needs However when you are ready to make a purchase your funding document along with a Project Management Service Request Form attached will be sent mailed faxed or emailed to the FBA for processing After FBA processes the funding document the FasTrac team will ensure that the services and content purchased are delivered Costs There will be a slight increase for new purchases Since contracts have not yet been finalized I am only able to provide you with an estimated cost The below prices have
