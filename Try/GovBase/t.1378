opportunities await particle physics over the next decade with new instruments and experiments poised to explore the frontiers of high energy infinitesimal distances and exquisite rarity We look forward to the Large Hadron Collider at CERN to explore the 1 TeV scale extending efforts at LEP and the Tevatron to unravel the nature of electroweak symmetry breaking and many initiatives to develop our understanding of the problem of identity what makes a neutrino a neutrino and a top quark a top quark Here I have in mind the work of the B factories and the hadron colliders on CP violation and the weak interactions of the b quark the wonderfully sensitive experiments around the world on CP violation and rare decays of kaons the prospect of definitive accelerator experiments on neutrino oscillations and the nature of the neutrinos and a host of new experiments on the sensitivity frontier We might even learn to read experiment for clues about the dimensionality of spacetime Experiments that use natural sources also hold great promise for the decade ahead We suspect that the detection of proton decay is only a few orders of magnitude away in sensitivity Astronomical observations should help to tell us what kinds of matter and energy make up the universe The areas already under development if not exploitation include gravity wave detectors neutrino telescopes cosmic microwave background measurements cosmic ray observatories ray astronomy and large scale optical surveys Indeed the whole complex of experiments and observations that we call astro cosmo particle physics should enjoy a golden age If we are inventive enough we may be able to follow this rich menu with the physics opportunities offered by a linear electron positron collider and a muon storage ring neutrino factory I expect a remarkable flowering of experimental particle physics and of theoretical physics that engages with experiment Our theories of the fundamental particles and the interactions among them are in a very provocative state We have achieved a simple and coherent understanding of an unprecedented range of natural phenomena but our new understanding raises captivating new questions In search of answers we have made far reaching speculations about the universe that may lead to revolutionary changes in our perception of the physical world and our place in it My work ranges over many topics in particle physics from electroweak symmetry breaking and supercollider physics to heavy quarks and the strong interaction among them to ultrahigh energy neutrino interactions The essential interplay between theory and experiment is a guiding theme Because we cannot hope to advance without new instruments I have devoted much energy to helping to define the future of particle physics and the new accelerators that will take us there Current Research Estia Eichten Ken Lane and I have been investigating http link aps org abstract PRL v89 p162002 B meson gateways to

Philadelphia APS Meeting in April 2003 We are now thinking about absorption lines caused by annihilation of UHE neutrinos on the relic neutrino background I am exploring new ways to envision particles and interactions to make the established relationships and open questions of particle physics accessible without equations I have devised a three dimensional object http boudin fnal gov quigg JGV
