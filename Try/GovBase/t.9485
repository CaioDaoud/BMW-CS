resources contacts asp Contact ORI Handling Misconduct ORI OVERSIGHT When ORI receives a report of an institutional inquiry or investigation into allegations of scientific misconduct it reviews the report for timeliness objectivity thoroughness and competence During its review ORI staff examine the institution s report and conclusions to determine whether the institutional findings are defensible well supported by the evidence and acceptable as a final resolution of the allegations During the oversight process ORI may need to review all substantial documentation used or prepared by the institution during the inquiry or investigation This includes grant applications publications computer files research data slides letters memoranda transcripts summaries of interviews etc ORI reviews the appropriateness and sufficiency of any analysis the institution conducted If the institution has not provided an adequate justification of how it reached its conclusions ORI may reanalyze or perform a new analysis of the research data publications or other source documents to determine whether to accept the institution s conclusions ORI frequently asks institutions to provide additional information consider additional questions or provide further analysis The oversight review usually results in agreement on the findings between the institution and ORI Occasionally ORI concludes that it is unable to base the PHS finding on the institutional finding because of differences in the definition of scientific misconduct the standard of proof or other pertinent factors Under these circumstances ORI may decline to pursue the allegation or it may refer the case to the Office of Inspector General for investigation When ORI completes an oversight review of an institutional inquiry or investigation it usually prepares an ORI oversight report that describes the institutional process and the rationale it developed for determining whether the allegation was substantiated If the allegation was not supported ORI sends a copy of the report to the institution and requests that the institution notify the respondent and whistleblower directly of the outcome of the investigation If the allegation was supported ORI may negotiate with the respondent a Voluntary Exclusion Agreement VEA in which the respondent accepts the imposition of PHS administrative actions without necessarily admitting the misconduct If such an agreement is not reached ORI recommends a finding of research misconduct and the imposition of administrative actions to the Assistant Secretary for Health for final decision programs tech assistance asp horizontal line Questions suggestions about this web page mailto rnathan osophs dhhs gov Webmaster Updated January 11 2002
