role as Nuclear Energy Lead Laboratory Key to revitalizing nuclear energy in the U S In 1999 DOE s Office of Nuclear Energy Science and Technology DOE NE designated the INEEL and Argonne National Laboratory ANL as lead laboratories for Nuclear Reactor Technology Over the past 50 years the INEEL and ANL have been world leaders in nuclear technology research and development R D In the summer of 2002 Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham announced the INEEL will serve as the nation s premier nuclear technology center The lead laboratories are chartered to Maintain world class staff and key facilities to pursue advanced nuclear reactor technology Maintain a living knowledge base Evaluate and integrate the results of R D and propose new research Stay abreast of developments associated with nuclear energy related research and Organize national and international forums to address key issues The lead laboratories were chosen for their complementary expertise and facilities INEEL has extensive expertise in light water and gas cooled nuclear systems design development and testing INEEL serves needs for nuclear regulatory and safety technical support probabilistic risk analysis nuclear engineering and design nuclear fuels development and testing and radiation measurements ANL has extensive expertise in liquid metal cooled reactors and fuel cycle analysis ANL serves needs for safety analysis nuclear engineering and design fuels and fuel cycle development and non proliferation Both lead laboratories have a strong international presence and are actively supporting DOE NE s three strategic goals Research and Development Promote the R D necessary to advance applications of nuclear technologies that improve U S energy security economic vitality and quality of life Infrastructure and Resource Management Manage the nuclear infrastructure isotopic inventories and human resources entrusted to DOE NE Quality Products and Services Provide reliable and high quality products and services that are responsive to customer needs Current activities of the lead labs are Generation IV Two major successes have been achieved in creating a next generation nuclear energy system to serve U S and world needs through the next century Technology Roadmapping INEEL and ANL provided technical and program management support to DOE NE in developing plans for a technology roadmap that includes extensive industry and international participation The roadmap analyzes and formulates R D programs for a number of promising reactor concepts Significant accomplishments were the organization of the project from diverse domestic and international views integrating the program with existing advisory groups and expertise and drafting preliminary goals for Generation IV that provide substantial advantages for nuclear energy International Forum INEEL and ANL have organized and supported DOE NE s Generation IV International Forum The Forum is composed of ten countries Argentina Brazil Canada France Japan South Korea South Africa Switzerland United Kingdom and the United States who have proclaimed their desire for Generation IV and the collaborative R D needed to achieve it Advanced Test Reactor User Facility Plan INEEL has developed a User Facility Plan for its Advanced Test Reactor ATR to enhance INEEL s capabilities to meet future research needs and attract researchers and projects with national and international recognition This plan was peer reviewed by potential sponsors and other user facility operators and was praised by DOE and potential users At this point a level of base funding is needed to complete several applications for new user facilities based on the ATR DOE Advisory Committee Participation INEEL provided substantial support to key DOE advisory committees INEEL has members on the Nuclear Energy Research Advisory Committee NERAC and the Fusion Energy Sciences Research Advisory Committee FESAC INEEL s involvement in NERAC activities included key technical support to its Isotope Research and Production Planning Subcommittee extensive efforts to assist the Long Term R D Planning Subcommittee with writing its R D Plan support and analysis for Idaho Operations Office DOE ID staff for the Technical Opportunities for Proliferation Resistant Systems TOPS Subcommittee and key technical support to the NERAC Infrastructure Roadmapping Subcommittee The lead laboratories also gave extensive assistance in developing DOE NE s strategic plans Nuclear Education Programs DOE ID and INEEL manage three of eight nuclear university programs within DOE the Nuclear Engineering Education and Research NEER program the University Reactor Instrumentation URI program and the University Fuel Assistance program NERI The INEEL is participating in five Nuclear Energy Research Initiative NERI projects that explore cutting edge R D of new reactor technologies NERI is an actively growing part of the DOE NE R D budget 7M of that amount is earmarked for a new thrust in international R D collaborations INEEL is well positioned to support this thrust Nuclear Infrastructure PEIS Support INEEL and DOE ID have supported the development of a Nuclear Infrastructure Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement PEIS by the DOE Other Initiatives Two cooperative agreements between Russia and the U S are being finalized The INEEL s lead role in the National Spent Fuel Management Program should position it to play a key role One agreement is development of spent fuel storage and waste repository options to allow Russia to stop its current practice of reprocessing civilian nuclear fuels The second is development of proliferation resistant nuclear fuel technologies The next ten years are crucial for nuclear energy in the U S Prior administration s policies have been to maintain nuclear energy as a viable option for the future without aggressive goals for performance improvements or new plant orders Meanwhile nuclear energy has weathered the uncertainties of electricity deregulation and existing plants have become a preferred investment with improved economic performance at virtually all plants and successful license extensions planned for many At the same time the growing realization of global warming has rekindled a serious need to deploy clean energy options on a global scale To meet the challenge of global warming nuclear must advance from a viable to an actively deployed option in the world and on a scale sufficient decrease carbon emissions All indications are that the promise of clean efficient nuclear energy can be realized by the renewed exploration of both traditional and non traditional nuclear systems to discover revolutionary new advances Nevertheless several difficult hurdles which cannot be ignored remain One is disposition of nuclear waste the other is public distrust regarding all aspects of nuclear energy Prof Jim Duderstadt NERAC Chairman has voiced the most pressing needs for the future of revitalized nuclear energy in terms of three basic factors the ideas people and tools needed to build the future Ideas Vigorous R D programs are needed in nuclear energy Current programs such as NERI are the birthing place for next generation technologies and need to be increased above current levels A new Generation IV R D program is needed in FY 2003 following the successful roadmap activities that will identify the most promising candidates for exploration People Substantial investments are needed in the broad spectrum of existing university nuclear programs as well as into preserving the knowledge base at the national laboratories and building the scientific research staff A new program aimed at creating a living knowledge base is proposed by the lead laboratories The program would feature the development of a core of key young staff at national laboratories who assist with the restoration and validation of valuable program data and who create a new updated archives summaries and comparisons that are of considerable value to researchers and their programs Tools A task as large as revitalizing nuclear energy requires a renewed R D investment in facilities following a time of relatively slack budgets for the U S nuclear energy infrastructure It is widely acknowledged that facilities that can test develop and demonstrate thermal and fast reactor technology over a wide range of fuel coolant and power conversion options will be needed ANL has recently had the termination account for its fast reactor program recast into a nuclear infrastructure account INEEL needs to have a similar recasting of its landlord account with an increase that can enable the creation of several user facilities based on the ATR that will serve growing needs for fuels development and testing stemming from Generation IV Contact Ralph Bennett Director 208 526 7708 cgi bin www print form pl name Ralph Bennett desc Nuclear Energy
