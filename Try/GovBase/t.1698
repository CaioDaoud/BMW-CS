sciences who wish to obtain advanced experience in an area of pharmacology or for those who are already pharmacologists to gain experience in new fields Research Research opportunities in pharmacology are broadly defined and can include for example molecular pharmacology biochemistry signal transduction mechanisms drug metabolism immunopharmacology chemistry and drug design endocrinology cell biology structural biology neuroscience gene therapy or training clinpharm html clinical pharmacology To learn more about training opportunities at NIH in clinical pharmacology see the http www cc nih
