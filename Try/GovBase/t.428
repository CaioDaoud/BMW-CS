BESS Information Page BESS being assembled in a lab BESS logo Balloon Borne Experiment with Superconducting Solenoidal Spectrometer BESS the Balloon borne Experiment with a Superconducting Solenoidal magnet is a joint project being carried out by Japanese and US scientists BESS is moving step by step toward a long duration ballooning search for antihelium nuclei in the galactic cosmic rays It has the largest geometry factor of any balloon borne magnet spectrometer currently flying and is ideally suited to statistics limited studies of Z 1 and Z 2 components identifying antiprotons measuring proton and helium spectra and separating isotopes of the galactic cosmic rays The planned effort in the USA is under the leadership of Dr Jonathan Ormes at the http pao gsfc nasa gov gsfc html Goddard Space Flight Center GSFC Other participants are Drs Mitchell Moiseev and Streitmatter at GSFC and Dr Eun Suk Seo at the University of Maryland University of Maryland There are several collaborating institutions in Japan The BESS project in Japan is under the general leadership of Prof Shuji Orito at the University of Tokyo The magnet and the detectors were designed and constructed in Japan at the KEK NASA provides the balloon flights and participates in the data analysis BESS has been described in detail elsewhere Yamamoto et al 1994 Moiseev et al 1997 The detector consists of a thin superconducting solenoidal magnet time of flight TOF scintillation counter hodoscopes inner drift chambers IDC jet type drift Jet particle tracking chamber and an aerogel Cherenkov counter which replaced outer drift chambers used in the first flights All the components are arranged in a horizontal cylindrical configuration with the IDC and Jet chambers located inside the warm bore of the magnet The instrument is being modified and improved each year The most recent configuration has a geometrical acceptance of 0 3 m2 sr aerogel Cherenkov counter with n 1 02 and a time of flight system of the 75 ps resolution capable of identifying antiprotons over the energy range from 175 MeV to 3 2 GeV BESS landed upright in brush with trees in the background BESS has had 5 successful flight campaigns in 1993 1994 1995 1997 and 1998 Currently it is being tested in beams of accelerated protons and antiprotons at KEK This represents a very important step toward improving of the precision of measuring the antiproton flux We plan to launch BESS again this summer 1999 from http www cancom net lliap lynnedo htm Lynn Lake Manitoba Canada More than 450 antiprotons were clearly identified in the first 4 flights Orito et al 1998 and about 400 more were detected in the 1998 flight The clear peak in the antiproton spectrum was reliably detected around 2 GeV with 10 precision Its position and absolute flux value agree with the Standard Leaky Box model prediction At low energy below 1 GeV we observe an excess antiproton flux more than predicted by the Leaky Box model This might indicate that our understanding of solar modulation or the galactic propagation mechanism needs to be modified or perhaps more interesting might suggest a new low energy antiproton component Novel sources such as evaporating black holes or the annihilating neutralino dark matter have been suggested The antiproton results have been published in Yoshimura et al 1995 Moiseev et al 1997 Matsunaga et al 1998 and have been presented in several major conferences and symposiums The exciting search for cosmic ray antihelium can address in a direct experimental way the question of whether or not the Universe is baryon symmetric The idea that large regions or domains of the Universe might be built of antimatter has been discussed for many years No antihelium was found in all BESS flights which set an upper limit of 1 7 x 10 6 for the antihelium to helium ratio Saeki et al 1998 However it is very problematic that a null result like this can rule out the existence of antimatter galaxies Even if they are out there producing anti cosmic rays and are somehow well separated from normal galaxies so as not to violate gamma ray limits cosmic rays at the rigidities accessible to current antimatter experiments are probably very strongly suppressed by galactic cluster and intergalactic magnetic fields Ormes et al 1997 Nevertheless we are very excited every year when we check the latest data hoping to find the first Ambassador from the Anti World The relative abundances of cosmic ray H and He isotopes were measured during the solar minimum 1995 1998 The 95 data provided the first measurement of the 3He 4He ratio near 1 GeV n during solar minimum Measured 1H 2He 3He and 4He spectra agree with the interstellar heliospheric propagation models Seo et al 1997 Based on the results obtained so far BESS is targeting the following goals for the next three years A more precise measurement of the antiproton spectrum will be made This combined with simultaneously obtained spectra of protons and helium will allow a more accurate calculation of the expected antiproton spectrum to be made for different propagation models By measuring the isotopes 2H and 3He simultaneously with antiprotons at various solar modulation levels it is possible to separate solar modulation effects especially those involving charge sign dependent terms from interstellar propagation effects Once these effects are understood and with higher statistics a more confident peek into the low energy window can be made to place more stringent constraints on new or exotic sources of antiprotons We will use accurate measurements of the H He ratio over a wide energy range over a large fraction of the solar cycle near solar minimum and both near the Earth BESS and in the outer heliosphere Voyager to test galactic propagation which includes continuous acceleration effects We will carry out the most sensitive search for antihelium that is currently envisioned as possible at the level of 10 7 from balloons In 1999 and 2000 we are planning to have 1 or 2 single day balloon flights each summer Every year improvements are made in the instrumentation In 2001 we plan to have a 3 day turn around
