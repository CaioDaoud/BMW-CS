Mission 3A began with the spectacular launch of the space shuttle Discovery on December 19 1999 at 7 50 pm EST This mission has taken on a new sense of urgency the world s most productive scientific observatory suspended operations several weeks ago because of a gyroscope failure This mission is needed to restore Hubble s ability to keep itself still enough to take scientific observations This flawless launch shows that the hard work and thoroughness of the launch team over the past six months has paid off The Hubble Space Telescope Project now stands ready to work with the flight operations team to restore the telescope to perfect operating condition This will happen through 10 days of detailed and meticulous work 24 hours a day throughout the holiday season Here are some pictures of the dedicated team that makes the Hubble Space Telescope possible Their personal sacrifices and the understanding of their families and friends are what make this project one of the most unique and successful human endeavors ever undertaken We hope you enjoy seeing some of these faces of Hubble tree Christmas Pictures more xmas jsc html More Christmas at JSC 12 26 99 stocc xmas html
