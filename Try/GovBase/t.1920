government agencies academia and other users of intelligent systems technologies Goals The mission of the Intelligent Systems Division ISD is to develop the measurements and standards infrastructure needed for the application of intelligent systems by manufacturing industries and Government agencies Our intelligent systems research and development program goals include primary bullet Open Systems Off the shelf plug and play components and software that are available from multiple suppliers primary bullet Interoperability Integration of factory floor machines operations and data primary bullet Extensibility Performance upgrades by adding sensors computing power communications and control features primary bullet Portability Software that is portable to different hardware platforms primary bullet Quality and Safety In process inspection and monitoring through sensor based control Approach By Intelligent Control researchers usually mean model based sensing or model based control and the general focus of the research community is now on Intelligent Systems rather than on limited individual aspects of sensing or control including distributed control among multiple autonomous agents or machines The basic paradigm for intelligent systems control architectures that we are pursuing in ISD at NIST is that of hierarchical control as shown in the diagram below We explicitly interpose a World Model hierarchy between the Sensor Processing Hierarchy and the Behavior Generation Hierarchy emphasizing the use of a model in sensing and in control Real Time Control System Logo We are pursuing this concept in terms of research to develop a basic understanding of the theoretical issues of intelligent control including architecture frameworks and knowledge representation in terms of tools and engineering methodologies for building real time controls for intelligent systems in terms of applications in manufacturing processes and in autonomous systems of interest to other mission agencies and in terms of standards and performance measurement techniques to promote the use and diffusion of these technologies in industry Benefits The discrete part manufacturing sector produces some 2 Trillion of goods every year This sector bears the brunt of forces of the competitive global marketplace where time to market and cost savings are basic survival issues NIST is providing necessary services for this sector in two ways L First interoperability achieving a seamless flow of data from design to the shop floor is absolutely necessary to achieve the 12 month car or plane A current NACFAM study confirms that this is the foremost strategic issue for manufacturers today and a matter of basic survival in the automobile industry which has surplus capacity worldwide NIST works with industry standards organizations and consortia to develop interoperability standards for robots machine tools and metrology equipment and uses testbeds to validate those standards and develop compliance tests Second the next twenty years will see a dramatic increase in intelligence of manufacturing process equipment on the shop floor Machines will be able to understand manufacturing processes to optimize production to work directly from product designs to sense and correct problems on the fly through embedded metrology and quality control sensors so that each and every part is made correctly without prove out test parts and to sense impending problems and call for maintenance before there is any l ost production Productivity of machine tools for example is predicted to rise by a factor of ten while accuracy is doubled NIST is working to understand the architectures and real time measurement and control needs for this future manufacturing capability to be able to provide appropriate measurements and standards to industry to support a competitive marketplace in the future Standards Partnerships with Industry NIST works with industry partners in developing standards primary bullet Open Modular Architecture Control OMAC Users Group ISO 10303 ISO 14649 and STEP Tools Inc on standards for machine tool controls primary bullet Robotics Industries Association on standards for robot controls primary bullet Metrology Automation Association CAM I DNSC and ISO AP219 on standards for metrology equipment and primary bullet American Welding Society A9 committee on standards for welding equipment interoperability Support for Other Government Agencies The leading edge of intelligent systems research is in military robotics medicine space and entertainment not in manufacturing To maintain leading edge capabilities in this field NIST supports the work of other mission agencies particularly the Army and DARPA in the development of military unmanned ground vehicles and the Department of Transportation in providing performance measures for crash avoidance systems Contact personnel wavering index htm Mr Albert Wavering Acting Division
