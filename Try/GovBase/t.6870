to the website for the 1999 South Florida Restoration Science Forum website Those who participated in the Forum Kick Off at the Embassy Suites Boca Raton on May 17 19 1999 saw displays showing the links between science and management decisions discussed how to strengthen those links and interacted with the scientists doing the work This web site houses that information plus new information that
