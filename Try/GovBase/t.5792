Microsoft Word 97 QECC Project Summary C PROGRAM FILES MICROSOFT OFFICE OFFICE html dot QECC Project Summary green diamond bar The goal of the Quantitative Evaluation of Contamination Consequences QECC project is to quantitatively relate workplace surface and airborne contamination levels both radioactive and chemical to intakes and doses The specific objectives of the project are to quantify available information that relates surface and volume contamination of equipment and materials to intakes and therefore health risks to workers and quantify how well air sampling predicts worker intakes and what factors improve or degrade the usefulness of air sampling to manage worker risks The central thrust is to compile relevant quantitative information from case histories in the scientific literature personal files and incident reports from national and international sources We are particularly interested in learning of current incidents and accidents or historical events for which adequate data are available We urge those reporting such incidents to include measurement data including the type and amount of material in process the nature extent and amounts of fixed and total surface contamination air sample results the nature of personal protective equipment in use description of work or incident and amount of time workers were present the minimum detectable amount MDA decision level DL and uncertainty for each measurement method used to estimate intakes ontakes skin contamination bioassay results nasal smear results and doses for each individual involved QECC innovates bypassing traditional risk assessment models and going directly to history advances realistic risk assessment by bounding the consequences of contamination defines the reasonably in ALARA harvests quantitative details from ORPS reports Operating Experience Summaries field personnel scientific literature and other sources to show the lessons learned We have analyzed scientific literature reports of operating experience and incidents and information about current events found in ORPS and NRC press releases Our aim is to estimate of how much dose a worker got as a result of workplace contamination based on actual occurrences rather than models The results are numerical lessons from each situation QECC is relevant to chemical and radiological exposures green diamond bar http www pnl gov Pacific Northwest National Laboratory Return to index htm QECC Home Page Contact mailto daniel j strom pnl gov Dan Strom Read about http qecc pnl gov sec priv html Security Privacy Revised July 21 2000
