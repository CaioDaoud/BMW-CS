Science Enterprise http www earth nasa gov ESE See the ESE Strategic Plan at http earth nasa gov visions http earth nasa gov visions LCLUC Goals Develop the capability to perform repeated global inventories of land use and land cover from space Develop the scientific understanding and models necessary to simulate the processes taking place Evaluate the consequences of observed and predicted changes Further the understanding of the consequences of land use and land cover changes on environmental goods and services the carbon and water cycles and the management of natural resources Improve understanding of human interaction with the environment and thus provide a scientific foundation for sustainability vulnerability and resilience of land systems and their use LCLUC Key Science Questions Where are land cover and land use changing what is the extent and over what time scale What are the causes and what are the consequences of LCLUC What are the projected changes of land use and land cover and their potential impacts What are the impacts of climate variability and changes on LCLUC and what is the potential feedback Roadmaps to Answering LCLUC Key Science Questions click
