Page last updated June 23 2003 User Policy at the Advanced Light Source Revised June 2003 1 Guiding Principles The aim of User Policy at the Advanced Light Source ALS is to provide a framework for establishing a challenging yet congenial environment where talented scientists from different backgrounds can work together in pursuit of the new scientific opportunities presented by the availability of this innovative facility User policy must address a variety of user needs and sensitivities On one hand the qualified researcher with little financial backing needs assurance of adequate access to the facility On the other hand qualified groups that make a large commitment of time and resources need some assurance of an equitable return on their investment A national facility should be accessible to all qualified researchers All proposals for research to be conducted at the ALS are evaluated based on the criteria endorsed by the International Union of Pure and Applied Physics IUPAP These criteria are detailed on the IUPAP Web site at http www iupap org statements html facil IUPAP Recommendations for the Use of Major Physics Users Facilities 2 Participating Research Teams Participating Research Teams PRTs engage in varying degrees in the funding building and operation of beamlines PRT members may be from a single institution or from a consortium of institutions Proposals to form PRTs will be reviewed for approval by the als ourorg sac html Scientific Advisory Committee SAC The term of a PRT will typically be for three years and the PRT will be expected to set aside some percentage of the available beamtime during this period for general users The actual percentage of beamtime will be based on the resources contributed by the PRT as negotiated with the ALS management The amount of beamtime set aside for the PRT and for general users will be determined with guidance from the SAC and recorded in a memorandum of understanding MOU PRT members are not eligible to apply for the general user beamtime on their own beamline unless this is specifically authorized in their MOU PRT members may however use unassigned independent investigator beamtime when it is available At the end of the three year period the PRT will be reviewed for renewal by the SAC 3 General Users formerly Independent Investigators General users are researchers who conduct experiments at the ALS but who are not members of a PRT Proposals Allocation of the beamtime for general users will be based on proposals evaluated by a als ourorg proposal panel html Proposal Study Panel PSP Proposals may be for a single experiment requiring one visit or for a program requiring multiple visits Scheduling Scheduling will be done by the ALS management in close consultation with PRT spokespersons and beamline managers Use of Endstations A beamline is considered to terminate at the exit slit or post focusing manifold of a monochromator If an experiment endstation can be easily removed from the beamline use of the endstation by other users will be at the discretion of the owner In cases where the endstation cannot be removed it will be taken that the PRT or owner has granted access to the endstation by outside users 4 ALS Policy and Procedure for Approved Programs An Approved Program AP enables an investigator or a group of investigators to receive an assured percentage of beamtime for a period of a few years to carry out an extended program of research It is generally expected that the investigator s will bring in some resources that enhance the capability of the facility The process for acquiring AP status begins with a short Letter of Interest 1 2 pages submitted by the principal investigator PI through the User Services Office for consideration by the Proposal Study Panel PSP Alternatively the PSP may solicit Letters of Interest from individuals or groups whom the panel feels have a record of outstanding proposals in the General User program The Letter of Interest should contain outline of the science to be pursued personnel involved justification for the AP status resources to be contributed beamline s and beamtime requested Based on the Letters of Interest the PSP will decide whether to encourage full proposals for granting AP status Full proposals will be a maximum of 10 pages and will contain in addition to the information in the Letter of Interest previous scientific accomplishments synchrotron track record synchrotron related publications The PSP will review the full proposals or send them out for external review and then make a recommendation to the Scientific Advisory Committee SAC to either approve not approve or not to act on each of the AP proposals Only a limited number of APs can be accommodated on a particular beamline It is therefore anticipated that relatively few full proposals will be encouraged so as to keep the chances of success relatively high The PSP recommendations will then be reviewed by the SAC for final approval The responsibility of the SAC is to ensure that the full array of APs in place across the entire facility reflects the frontier of synchrotron radiation science The ALS Director will send a letter to the PIs of successful proposals specifying the percentage of beamtime and the period of the AP The AP program will terminate at the end of the prescribed period but an additional period can be requested through another Letter of Interest and a full AP proposal 5 Special Projects Some portion of the general user beamtime will be allocated to special projects in order to meet LBNL contractual obligations such as CRADAs Cooperative Research and Development Agreements Such agreements will be monitored by the SAC 6 Director Discretionary Time Some small fraction of the available beamtime may also be designated as director discretionary time to be allocated by the ALS Division Director for Science typically for short trials deemed desirable for the development of the ALS scientific and or industrial program 6 Conformance and Performance While variances from the terms of the MOUs are acceptable subject to good faith adherence to the provisions noted in section 2 prt Particpating Research Teams the ALS management will have the right to renegotiate terms in the event of nonperformance or nonconformance by a PRT 7 Users Association and als uec index html Users Executive Committee Current and potential users of the ALS are eligible for membership in the Advanced Light Source Users Association ALSUA After nominations are made at the ALSUA Annual Meeting members will elect by mail ballot representatives to a Users Executive Committee UEC which will serve as the official voice of the user community in its interactions with ALS management The als uec charter html ALS Users Association Charter provides additional information about the membership organization and rules of the ALSUA 8 als ourorg proposal panel html Proposal Study Panels Responsibilities of the Proposal Study Panels It is the responsibility of the Proposal Study Panels PSPs to evaluate beamtime proposals from general users and make recommendations on beamtime allocation Evaluation Criteria The following criteria endorsed by the International Union of Pure and Applied Physics IUPAP in the http www iupap org statements html facil IUPAP Recommendations for the Use of Major Physics Users Facilities will be used to evaluate beamtime proposals Scientific merit Technical feasibility Capability of the experimental group Availability of the resources required Procedures The General Sciences PSP and Protein Crystallography PSP meet at least twice a year to review beamtime proposals from general users The PSP compares the individual panel members scores for each proposal discussing and resolving any large variance in scores Where appropriate the PSP provides constructive comments for beamtime proposals PSP members are required to provide a spread in scores between highest and lowest rated proposals thereby providing the basis for the beamtime allocation process The PSP is encouraged to maintain a balance in science among high and low rated proposals Multiple proposals for similar science from a single user or group of users may be treated as a single proposal Panel members who are a primary author a co author or a collaborator in a proposal under study are required to recuse themselves from the discussion and grading of the proposal Panel members are not permitted to vote or discuss proposals that are in direct competition with their own scientific program Users in disagreement with their PSP score may request in writing to the PSP Chair a review of their proposal PSP Membership PSP members are appointed by the ALS Director based on nominations submitted by the ALS Users Executive Committee Every attempt is made to have all the scientific disciplines at the ALS represented on the panel The term of an appointment to the PSP is usually three years 9 als ourorg sac html Scientific Advisory Committee A Scientific Advisory Committee SAC is appointed by the Berkeley Lab Director to advise the Laboratory through the ALS Director on current operations allocation of facility resources strategic planning budget development and other major issues The SAC also reviews proposals to establish new PRTs and special projects and monitors progress and performance of approved teams The SAC is composed of at least nine scientists knowledgeable in the areas of research relevant to the ALS and meets at least twice a year The chairs of the UEC and the PSP serve as ex officio members of the SAC Sensitive deliberations of the SAC are confidential but they are communicated in writing to the Director of the ALS and to the Director of Berkeley Lab 10 als ourorg spb html Science Policy Board A Science Policy Board SPB has been established to advise the Director of Berkeley Lab on major policy issues concerning the ALS The SPB is composed of persons distinguished by excellence of scientific accomplishment and experience in the administration of large scientific organizations The SPB meets as needed and communicates the outcome of its deliberations to the Berkeley Lab Director 11 Beamtime Charges The ALS is a national user facility funded by the Department of Energy Office of Basic Energy Science There will be no charge for beamtime used for nonproprietary experiments but DOE pricing policy will apply for experiments whose results are not intended for the open literature In addition experimenters will be required to open operating or equipment fabrication accounts to collect non beamtime related costs such as stores issues equipment purchases or fabrications performed in Berkeley Lab and ALS facilities 12 User Agreements with Berkeley Lab All ALS users conducting research at the facility will execute either a User Agreement or another available approved legal instrument for agreement with Berkeley Lab This agreement between the user s institution and Berkeley Lab will form the contractual basis covering certain laboratory administrative practices the distribution of intellectual property rights and the allocation of funds and responsibilities With respect to patent protection ALS users may in most cases receive advance rights to any inventions or proprietary data developed under the user agreement whereby the user has the option to take title to such inventions The U S Government reserves certain rights to intellectual property and those rights are outlined in the agreements as negotiated between the parties 13 Conflict Resolution Process A formal grievance mechanism exists at the ALS for the resolution of conflicts between users and or between users and the ALS Parties seeking redress or resolution of a conflict can submit a petition to the ALS Director who will if warranted appoint an ad hoc committee to review the matter under dispute The committee composed of representatives from the Users Executive Committee the Scientific Advisory Committee and the ALS will advise the Director on the fair resolution of the dispute
