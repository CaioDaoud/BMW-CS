conduct of business and for the processing of applications in the Washington Administrative Code WAC lawrule html Title 463 The Certification Process EFSEC certification is the state licensing process for the siting construction and operation of an energy project A Preliminary preliminary site study may be done prior to starting the certification process to assess whether to proceed with an application The Council is responsible for evaluating applications to ensure that all environmental and socioeconomic impacts are considered before a site is approved After evaluating an application EFSEC submits a recommendation to the Governor If the Council determines that constructing and operating the facility will produce minimal adverse effects on the environment ecology of the land and wildlife and ecology of the state waters and aquatic life then it recommends that a Site Certification Agreement SCA be approved and signed by the Governor The SCA lists the conditions the applicant must meet during construction and while operating the facility top back to top Regulatory Responsibilities The EFSEC statute directs the council html Council to regulate the construction and operation of the facility EFSEC is the state s regulatory agency that determines compliance with state laws and the terms set in the SCA EFSEC contracts with other state agencies for on site inspection The Council has the regulatory authority to enforce compliance with state laws and the conditions in the SCA through fines or by ceasing construction or operation of the project EFSEC continues this oversight responsibility through restoration of the site after the project is terminated top back to top Major Energy Facilities The major energy facilities subject to review by the Energy Facility Site Evaluation Council are Any stationary thermal non hydro power plants with electrical generating capacity of lawrule html 350 MW 350 000 kilowatts or more including associated facilities such as transmission lines in excess of 200 000 volts Energy facilities of any size that exclusively use alternative energy resources wind solar geothermal landfill gas wave or tidal action or biomass energy can opt in to the EFSEC review and certification process Floating thermal power plants of lawrule html 100 MW 100 000 kilowatts or more Crude or refined petroleum or liquid petroleum product pipelines larger than 6 inches in diameter and greater than 15 miles in length Crude or refined petroleum or liquefied petroleum facilities that can receive more than an average of 50 000 barrels per day that will be or have been transported over marine waters This doesn t apply to storage facilities unless they are part of a new energy plant or transmission facility Natural gas synthetic fuel gas or liquefied petroleum gas pipelines larger than 14 inches in diameter and greater than 15 miles in length intrastate only Liquid natural gas facilities with capacity to receive an equivalent of more than 100 000 000 cu ft per day that has been transported over marine waters Any underground natural gas storage reservoir capable of delivering more than 100 000 000 cu ft per day Refineries capable of processing more than 25 000 barrels per day of petroleum into refined product top back to top Preliminary Potential Site Study Prior to submitting an application for certification a prospective applicant may request that EFSEC conduct a Preliminary or Potential Site Study Conducting a Preliminary Site Study can help determine if there are any environmental social or regulatory hurdles that can not be overcome rendering the project unsuitable Determining this before beginning the certification process saves the applicant time and money In addition a Preliminary Site Study allows EFSEC to begin assessing what resources it will need for reviewing and processing the application A Preliminary Site Study saves prospective applicants time and expense by informing them of existing environmental conditions and enables the Council to prepare for the application and its review After receiving a request to study a potential site the Council commissions an independent consultant to study relevant site issues The study includes preparing and analyzing environmental impact information for the proposed site Any other matters the Council and the applicant believe are essential to an adequate appraisal of the potential site are also studied In conducting the study the Council cooperates with Cities county or counties in which the potential site is located Any federal state or local governmental agency that might be requested to comment upon the potential site Any municipal or public corporation having an interest in the matter The Council holds open meetings to ask the public to identify issues that should be addressed in the application A 10 000 fee must accompany an applicant s request for a Preliminary Site Study Until the Council receives this fee it will not take any action The Council applies the 10 000 fee to the study If the Council finds that 10 000 is insufficient to cover the costs of the study the Council advises the applicant and requests additional funds The study is discontinued if the applicant does not agree to pay the additional costs top back to top Certification The EFSEC certification process was designed to give applicants an opportunity to present their proposals allow interested parties to express their concerns to the Council and have the Council to address issues related to the application There are six major steps in the certification process 1 Application Submittal Application Submittal 2 Appl Application Review 3 Initial Public Hearing Initial public hearings 4 Environmental Impact Statement Environmental impact statement 6 Adjudicative Adjudicative proceedings and permits review 6 Recommendation to the Governor Recommendation to the Governor Each step has specific requirements the applicant and the Council must follow to ensure a comprehensive and balanced review of the project Many of the steps take place at the same time EFSEC project siting review flow chart EFSEC 20Process pdf PDF 1 page 1 Application Submittal Submitting an application is the first step in the EFSEC certification process An application to EFSEC must follow the Guidelines for Applications found in FILES wac 463 42 TXT Chapter 463 42 Washington Administrative Code WAC The application must be accompanied by a 25 000 fee The guidelines require the applicant to fully address more than 60 subjects dealing with environmental and socioeconomic impacts including measures the applicant will take for mitigating or offsetting impacts the project may have An applicant may request EFSEC conduct its review using an Expedited Process In an Expedited Process the Council is required to determine eligibility within 4 months of application submittal and make a recommendation to the Governor within 6 weeks of granting eligibility However to be eligible for expedited processing the Council must find that the proposed project is consistent with existing local land use ordinances and following factors are not significant enough to warrant a full review of the application Environmental impact Cost and magnitude Area potentially affected Change in use of the site One application to EFSEC was successful in meeting these criteria and after EFSEC s review was approved by the Governor 2 Application Review When an application is submitted EFSEC begins its application review EFSEC retains an independent consultant to ascertain if the information submitted in the application conforms to the guidelines in FILES wac 463 42 TXT Chapter 463 42 WAC and to prepare an Environmental Impact Statement EIS The 25 000 application fee is applied toward the cost of the independent consultant under contract to EFSEC for this review In the application the applicant commits to construct and operate the proposed facility in an environmentally safe manner and to abide by the rules and regulations that the Council will use to monitor and check for compliance with state laws The application should contain all the information and data necessary for the development of and EIS and provide the basis for the adjudicative hearing EFSEC s independent consultant will advise the Council and the applicant if additional information is needed to prepare the EIS and or commence the adjudicative hearings When the Council determines there is sufficient information regarding the proposed project it will proceed with the adjudicative hearings The Council asks the counties cities and port districts where the project is to be located to appoint representatives to sit on the Council when it considers issues within their jurisdiction State law http www leg wa gov RCW index cfm fuseaction section section 80 50 030 RCW 80 50 030 only gives voting authority to city and county representatives not to port district representatives These members serve until the proposed site is accepted or rejected 3 Initial Public Meeting No later than 60 days of receipt of the application the Council must hold an initial public meeting on the proposed project The purpose of the initial public meeting is to explain the proposed project and the Council process After the applicant has described the proposed project the Council explains the process for review determination and recommendation to the Governor The Council also allows the public to present written or oral testimony relating to the proposed project This meeting may also act as scoping meetings for the EIS The initial public hearing is held in the vicinity of the proposed project after notifying public officials publishing public notices and putting out news releases 4 Land Use Consistency Hearing Subsequent to the informational public meeting the Council must hold a land use hearing to ascertain if the proposed project is consistent with county or regional land use plans or ordinances Anyone wishing to address the Council regarding consistency with land use plans may testify at this hearing If the Council determines the project is not consistent with local land use plans the applicant can apply to the local agency for a variance to the plan or ordinance If the local agency does not grant a variance the applicant can request state preemption of the local zoning ordinance If the applicant requests state preemption an adjudicative hearing is held in order for the Council to hear testimony concerning the request If the Council approves a request the Council must give due consideration to community interests and local rules and ordinances in the recommendation to the Governor Details for this process are contained in FILES wac 463 28 TXT Chapter 463 28 WAC 5 Environmental Impact Statement The project may require a simple Environmental Checklist or most likely a more detailed Environmental Impact Statement It may fall under both state and federal jurisdiction State Environmental Policy Act SEPA For major energy facilities the Council becomes the lead FILES wac 463 47 TXT SEPA agency If the proposal is an action and not exempt from SEPA the Council asks the applicant to complete an Environmental Checklist A checklist is not needed if the Council and applicant agree that an EIS is required The applicant may also submit an Environmental Checklist with its application National Environmental Policy Act NEPA In the past EFSEC has worked cooperatively with federal agencies to develop EISs conduct hearings and publish EISs for projects that fall under both the National Environmental Policy Act and the State Environmental Policy Act EFSEC s policy is to continue to develop and conduct cooperative NEPA SEPA reviews when possible The EIS Process The Council prepares and distributes the EIS The Council retains an independent consultant to prepare the document The applicant bears the expense of the EIS preparation but the consultant works for the Council The Council can require the applicant to provide additional information that may require the applicant to conduct specific investigations The amount of time required to develop an EIS depends on If done in cooperation with the federal government the time it takes to hold informal state and federal planning sessions and develop a Memorandum of Understanding between the state and federal agencies to designate the roles of each agency in developing an environmental document Whether the information contained in the application is complete The time it takes to develop and finalize draft and final documents The public is notified when the draft EIS is ready The EIS is subjected to public review The Council holds public hearings on the draft EIS If it is a joint federal state EIS joint hearings are held At the same time the EIS is developed and related public hearings on the draft EIS are held adjudicative proceedings may take place However the adjudicative proceedings must be finalized before the Council issues the final EIS 6 Adjudicative Proceedings and Permits Review Adjudicative proceedings are held at the same time Air air and water discharge permits are developed Adjudicative Proceedings EFSEC s certification process calls for the Council to hold hearings on the proposed project to allow the applicant and opponents to present information to support their cases Council rule requires the hearings to be conducted as Adjudicative Proceedings FILES wac 463 30 TXT Title 463 30 WAC FILES wac 30 TXT The Council s Adjudicatory Proceeding is a quasi judicial process similar to courtroom proceedings where the Council hears from the official parties to the proceedings By law all state agencies with members on the Council are considered parties to any Adjudicatory Proceeding before the Council however they may not elect to participate as a party If an agency wishes to be an active participant in the proceedings the agency s Assistant Attorney General represents the agency during the proceedings The state Attorney General s Office appoints a http www wa gov ago enviro counsel html Counsel for the Environment to be a party in the proceedings representing the public and its interest in protecting the quality of the environment Other interested persons tribes groups or local state or federal agencies may petition the Council to become interveners in the proceedings The Council considers the intervener petitions and determines whether to grant intervener participation based on the project s impact on the concerns of the interveners If denied party status petitioners may ask the Council for administrative review if they disagree with the Council s decision Prehearing Conferences A series of prehearing conferences are held prior to the adjudicative proceedings to organize and schedule the hearings by subject matter The primary purpose of the prehearing conferences is to streamline the hearings as much as possible by defining focusing and narrowing the issues The Council or hearings officer uses these conferences to determine what contested issues will be heard during the adjudicative hearings the order of issues to be heard and a schedule for the hearings In that way each individual issue can be addressed in a logical and methodical manner Hearings The Council may use an Administrative Law Judge or conduct the hearings itself The Council attends the hearings but may rely on its Administrative Law Judge for procedural rulings and other legal matters during the hearings The adjudicatory proceedings are conducted in a quasi judicial manner in accordance with the Washington State Administrative Procedures Act http www leg wa gov RCW index cfm fuseaction chapterdigest chapter 34 05 Chapter 34 05 RCW Expert testimony is given and cross examination is allowed It is recommended that parties and interveners have legal counsel represent them during the hearings The testimony and exhibits introduced during these proceedings are the basis for the record the Council refers to when determining whether to recommend project approval or disapproval to the Governor Information from these proceedings is also used to determine the SCA s conditions for construction and operation of the project The applicant must meet these conditions if the Governor approves the project Air and Water Discharge Permits In tandem with the adjudicative proceedings the Council initiates its process for developing air and water discharge permits if needed Additional hearings are scheduled for developing the conditions to be set in the air and water discharge permits Discharges to the air may require the applicant to receive a Prevention of Significant Deterioration FILES wac 463 39 txt PSD permit The Environmental Protection Agency EPA has delegated responsibility for issuing the PSD to the Council The PSD permit details the components and levels of contaminants that may be discharged to the air by the project The applicant must provide evidence that the project will meet all local state and federal Clean Air Act standards before the Council will issue the permit The EPA has also granted the Council authority to issue the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System FILES wac 463 38 TXT NPDES permit for discharging wastes in the state s waters Again the applicant is required to provide evidence that any discharge to state waters will meet all the standards in the state and federal Clean Water Acts Air quality standards are set in

463 38 WAC Council Considerations When the adjudicative hearings have concluded the Council takes time to consider the information collected during the proceedings After its deliberations the Council writes an administrative order containing the Council s findings of fact conclusions of law and if it finds the project should proceed a recommendation to the Governor to approve the project The Council has the option of issuing a preliminary or draft administrative order allowing the parties to take exceptions to the findings The Council then reviews any exceptions and issues a final administrative order 7 Recommendation to the Governor If the Council determines the project should be recommended to the Governor it develops a draft Site Certification Agreement to be signed by the Governor The SCA has all of the environmental social economic and engineering conditions the applicant must meet for construction and operation throughout the life of the project The draft SCA includes any proposed PSD or NPDES permits developed by the Council as attachments If the Council determines the project should not be recommended to the Governor for approval the final order explains the Council s decision The Governor has 60 days to consider the Council s recommendation and can take one of the following actions Approve the Council recommendation and execute the draft SCA Reject
