causing dangerous warming of the earth s atmosphere Observed and projected impacts include hotter days additional smog sea level rise and a 15 to 30 percent reduction in surface water supply to California s cities and farms over this century Climate change matters to California The repercussions of a change in climate are serious They challenge the state s infrastructure investments and touch all sectors of the economy water supply agriculture forestry energy production health transportation tourism and others Climate change is driven in large part by carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases derived from fossil fuels While electricity production and industry are universally important sources transportation is the source of more than half of the fossil fuel carbon dioxide in California It is critical that the state begin to reduce the rate of growth in emissions from this sector Crucial to achieving this result is Assembly Bill 1493 authored by Assemblywoman Pavley and signed by Governor Davis on July 22 2002 This statute directs the California Air Resources Board to develop regulations to achieve maximum feasible cost effective reductions in greenhouse gas emissions from new gasoline cars and light duty trucks vehicles beginning in 2009 California is also pursuing actions related to many other aspects of climate change and can build on these to fashion a comprehensive strategy California can do more leveraging its vast intellectual and economic resources in preparing for foreseeable future impacts and on reducing greenhouse gases in the atmosphere In so doing we can create jobs export goods and train our talented workforce Responding to climate change need not be an additional burden but can in fact promote economic development ensure energy
