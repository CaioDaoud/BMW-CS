at the bottom of this page We have been honored to lead the Millennial Housing Commission during the past 17 months as we performed a thorough re examination of the federal role in meeting the nation s housing challenges at Congress request The 22 commissioners appointed to this task were drawn from across the country and from across the spectrum of housing ideologies and experience We are particularly pleased therefore to have achieved concurrence among all but one of the appointed members Click http www mhc gov rector doc here to obtain a copy of the Dissenting Statement to the Report of the Millennial Housing Commission by Commissioner Robert Rector The Commission included former elected officials participants on previous national commissions housing researchers builders managers and owners planners and public administrators and leaders of community development organizations Our findings and recommendations obviously reflect the great diversity of philosophy and experience represented but on one thing we all agree we unequivocally care about housing and some fundamental precepts First housing matters It represents the single largest expenditure for most American families and the single largest source of wealth for most homeowners The development of housing has a major impact on the national economy and the economic growth and health of regions and communities Housing is inextricably linked to access to jobs and healthy communities and the social behavior of the families who occupy it The failure to achieve adequate housing leads to significant societal costs Second there is simply not enough affordable housing The inadequacy of supply increases dramatically as one moves down the ladder of family earnings The challenge is most acute for rental housing in high cost areas and the most egregious problem is for the very poor We recognize that our country is engaged in a war that affects our vital interests and that we have experienced a serious economic downturn from which we are entering a tentative recovery There is a serious public debate as to which tax and spending policies will best support the sound fiscal management that our nation requires Even within this context resources for affordable housing provide important economic social and societal benefits The inexorable growth in the numbers of families of those working in service sectors and of immigrants seeking to take part in the American Dream coupled with community opposition to high density development the gentrification or abandonment and deterioration of an increasing percentage of our housing stock and the growing affordability gap between haves and have nots require that the Government of the United States seriously address the question of how our society can produce and preserve more housing for more American families in a more rational thoughtful and efficient way in the decade ahead As affordable housing production is increased within the context of healthy inclusive communities the economy is strengthened more families share common American values and economic opportunity is increased for many We are pleased to present the Millennial Housing Commission s recommendations which we hope will engage the elected officials of our democracy to meet these challenges CLICK http www mhc gov MHCReport pdf HERE TO VIEW DOWNLOAD FINAL REPORT IN PDF
