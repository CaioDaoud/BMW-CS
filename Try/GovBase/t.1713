Underway With over 5800 awards already made in the 2003 Assistance to Firefighters Grant Program the U S Fire Administration USFA continues to work diligently on completing the remaining 2003 awards which are expected to total around 9 500 recipients in all Also underway is the planning for the 2004 Assistance to Firefighters Grant Program which has been appropriated 750 000 000 by Congress and the President While the 2004 funds have been assigned to the Department of Homeland Security s Office of Domestic Preparedness ODP ongoing coordination meetings between USFA and ODP are already being conducted to assure a smooth and seamless transition of the Assistance to Firefighters Grant Program for 2004 Present plans are for USFA to administer the program for ODP in 2004 with very little change anticipated While it is likely that a limited number of specialized items and training activities to enhance preparedness for terrorism and WMD preparedness will be added to the list of eligible grant projects in 2004 the AFG Program will continue to maintain its major focus on enhancing basic firefighting capabilities for America s fire departments The nine national fire service organizations that have provided input and criteria guidance to USFA for previous years programs have already convened and completed their recommendations for the 2004 AFG Program With that fire service input completed actual details of the 2004 Assistance to Firefighters Grant Program are presently being developed so that the 2004 Program Guidance and Notice of Funds Availability can be ready for release in early January Since coordination meetings between ODP and USFA are continuing on a weekly basis it is anticipated that the 2004 AFG program will be able to maintain a calendar similar to previous years AFG Programs with workshops and informational sessions commencing in mid January and the application period occurring during the month of March Participating staff from both ODP and USFA remain fully committed to assuring the continued success of the Assistance to Firefighters Grant Program which passes critically needed federal dollars direct to local fire departments in order to enhance their basic capabilities top Back to the Top Residential Sprinkler Law Goes into Effect in Maryland Thanks in Part to the US Fire Administration Just four months after the US Fire Administration USFA went on the record advocating both sprinkler systems Dave Paulison was invited to celebrate and join in the signing of the new sprinkler ordinance enacted in Montgomery County Maryland thus becoming the largest jurisdiction in the nation to mandate sprinkler systems in new homes The US Fire Administrator was able to recognize the efforts of Montgomery County legislative and fire officials to enact this legislation draw attention to the proactive efforts of those involved with the new ordinance and use this opportunity to once again draw attention to the importance of residential sprinklers The Montgomery legislation requires all new single family houses to include an approved fire sprinkler system The law also requires that all property tax notices provide information about the local tax credit available for installing sprinkler systems in existing buildings that lack sprinkler systems Maryland state and county laws already require sprinkler systems in new multi family dwellings townhouses and commercial structures Sprinkler systems are an important step toward reducing the number of people in the U S who lose their lives in house fires each year some 3 000 people died in house fires in 2002 Tests of new residential quick response sprinkler systems show that sprinklers respond in as little as 35 seconds completely extinguishing a fire Sprinkler systems normally cost less than one percent of the cost of a new house similar to wall to wall carpeting Nationally no more than two percent of new residences are being protected with residential sprinkler systems The USFA believes that other counties and municipalities may be inclined to follow Montgomery County s lead as they see the positive effect of such legislation on loss of life and property due to residential fires top Back to the Top US Fire Administrator Named Fire Protection Person of the Year The Society of Fire Protection Engineers has named U S Fire Administrator R David Paulison who also serves as FEMA s director of preparedness Fire Protection Person of the Year The award presented at the society s annual banquet recognizes significant lasting achievement in fire protection Paulison was honored for his contribution to the nation in his role as USFA administrator and for his commitment to fire prevention and innovative approaches to fire safety We congratulate Chief Paulison as the recipient of this outstanding achievement award said Michael D Brown Under Secretary of Homeland Security for Emergency Preparedness and Response Chief Paulison s hard work and dedication has been well noted and appreciated within the Department of Homeland Security and I am glad that his work has received recognition outside of the agency as well top Back to the Top FEMA Announces New Fire Safety Resource to Enhance Fire Safety FEMA has joined with the Fire Safety Council FSC to address the threat of fires in residential homes The joint effort which will focus initial efforts on the 5 million American homes without smoke alarms will include a two year pilot phase with focus on public fire safety education and awareness as well as new research on fire safety technology for the home Though all of the partners have had smoke alarm installation programs a joint effort combining knowledge and experiences from these programs has never before been attempted Additionally FEMA and the FSC have launched the web site goodbye jsp url http www firesafety gov www firesafety gov to provide up to date information about program activities prevention tips and a special interactive page for children to learn about fire safety The National Fire Protection Association reports that an estimated 2 670 people died in residential fires in 2002 The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention the USFA and the Consumer Product Safety Commission were the founding FSC partners Other member agencies and organizations include the American Red Cross the Congressional Fire Services Institute the International Association of Fire Chiefs the International Fire Marshals Association the National Association of State Fire Marshals and National Fire Protection Association among others top Back to the Top FEMA and USFA Used Daylight Savings Time Change to Push Smoke Alarm Use FEMA and the USFA urged residents to replace their smoke alarm batteries and check their units on Oct 27 when clocks were turned back to end Daylight Savings Time Some 2 700 people lost their lives in residential fires in 2002 and another 14 000 were injured In many of the house fires where lives are lost an operating smoke alarm could have made a difference Studies show that a smoke alarm reduces the risk of dying in a house fire by 50 percent Residents were urged to Install smoke alarms on every level of your home especially near bedrooms Test all smoke alarms monthly Keep smoke alarms clean by vacuuming over and around them regularly As with any appliance smoke alarms wear out Replace the entire unit after 10 years or as recommended by the manufacturer Make sure you know the location of your fire department police station and hospital and post a list of emergency numbers near all the telephones Organize and practice a family fire drill top Back to the Top Homeland Security Office of Inspector General Completes Assessment of the Assistance to Firefighters Grant Program Finds Equitable and Dynamic Process The Department of Homeland Security s Office of Inspector General recently completed an assessment of the first Assistance to Firefighters Grant Program which has been providing funds to rural urban and suburban fire departments throughout the United States since 2001 I wish to thank all of those individuals including DHS FEMA and USFA staff who have helped make this program as successful as the assessment indicated said U S Fire Administrator R David Paulison But our work is not complete We will review recommendations

implementing GIS in their departments as the tool of choice for analysis and display of their departments activities reported via NFIRS then related to the geographic areas and populations they protect To assist in this USFA has released a first edition CD ROM based GIS Tutorial FA 259 This CD ROM serves as an introduction for the fire service to these technologies while offering links to more advanced information and key resources including the United States National Grid North American Datum 1983 USNG NAD83 standard the single consensus location interoperability reference standard required nationwide to make location based technologies such as Global Positioning Systems and GIS the most effective and useful they can be in terms of equipment plans communications protocols and disaster operations The NFIRS data standard used by fire departments around the USA for many years also is a great advantage when it comes to interoperable computer based technologies being able to use fire incident data to fight fire with facts Because there is a stable and long standing data content standard in place NFIRS GIS applications developed by one vendor or fire department can easily be used by and or shared with others Also included in a separate folder on the CD ROM is a video viewable on a PC with a media player called Mapping the Future of Fire provided courtesy of American Heat Primedia Workplace Learning This video shows community enterprise GIS concepts and real fire department uses for GIS on the apparatus and in the office implemented from scratch for the Wilson

Training for Emergency Responders A technical review of the devastating explosion at Concept Sciences Inc CSI in Pennsylvania which claimed five lives and caused 5 million in damage has been released The explosion in Hanover Township could be seen for seven miles produced a four foot deep crater and damaged 11 adjacent buildings to CSI which manufactured free base hydroxylamine a semiconductor cleaner The USFA review noted that it was 60 to 80 minutes into the incident before the hazardous materials team became fully operational and able to conclusively identify the product and that some emergency personnel entered the area without proper protective clothing Other lessons learned cited in the report include The incident response involved three agencies from three counties but there was no set radio frequency that was common Although more than 400 personnel responded in addition to agencies from the local state and federal level a unified incident command system and solid emergency management plan allowed the incident to be successfully managed Extreme caution must be exercised when search and rescue dogs are used in a situation involving hazardous materials Chemicals that are caustic to the respiratory tract can severely injure a dog and permanently reduce or destroy their olfactory abilities Fire investigators state police officers and coroner s personnel who responded did not have a significant amount of training in handling hazardous materials incidents and they lacked the protective clothing and respiratory devices requires to safely work an incident of this type After receiving calls of the explosion on Feb 19 1999 firefighters arrived at CSI to find a collapsed building smoke drifting from the blast site and a small fire of little significance Water was pouring from the demolished automatic sprinkler system and the area was strewn with debris and crushed cars Six people were trapped and the Pennsylvania Urban Search and Rescue Task Force from Harrisburg Pa was activated and responded The incident lasted for nearly four days The investigation into the cause of the explosion is continuing A copy of the full report is at fire service

grants for over 10 million went to fire departments throughout the U S The grants will ultimately total approximately 9500 awards worth almost 750 million in direct assistance to firefighters Since June more than 5800 fire departments have received nearly 406 million to support their role as first responders in the neighborhoods and communities they serve USFA is looking for success stories Please send your photos with captions to mailto Thomas Olshanski dhs gov Thomas Olshanski dhs gov top Back to the Top Firefighter Training Report A technical special report on the risks of firefighting training and ways to reduce deaths and injuries has been released the report underscores the inherent danger of such training but reiterated the importance of experience gained in real rather than closely controlled training fires The USFA review also highlighted the importance of following currently accepted procedures and standards to avoid training deaths and injuries and the need for instructors to avoid situations for which the students are not yet prepared The challenge is very real Since 1987 reported training related injuries have increased by nearly 21 percent In 2001 alone almost 7 000 training related injuries were reported That year a firefighter died and two were injured while participating in a live burn training situation At the same time live fire training buildings and simulators fed by propane or natural gas have many safety features but may not provide the same realism as live fire training in acquired structures according to the report The training buildings for example fail to teach students to react to the diverse conditions encountered in real fire operations In addition the need to provide training in situations other than fires such as hazardous material incidents increases the danger to participants In 1997 for example a member of a unit training to respond to a chemical incident was overcome by a nerve agent and needed to be administered an antidote to stop the seizures This special report was based on meetings informal interviews and a study of a wide array of fire training literature A copy of the full report can be

FEMA s National Emergency Training Center will kick off a new Area Warning System in December The system properly known as a Mass Notification High Power Voice and Siren System is made up of outdoor warning speakers that can provide pre recorded messages allow for live instructions and or sound alert sirens indicating that citizens need to immediately turn on their radios or televisions for emergency information Located on the southern edge of Emmitsburg just outside town limits NETC is installing the system at its facility as well We had been looking for such an opportunity and given our role in helping communities and the nation prepare for major emergencies we were delighted to join with Mayor Hoover and the town of Emmitsburg in installing a part of the system at the National Emergency Training Center said US Fire Administrator R David Paulison In the planning stages for well over a year this new system can be a powerful life saving tool Emmitsburg is the second Maryland community to have such a system LaPlata installed a system following a F 5 tornado which left a swath of deadly destruction more than a 20 miles long last year The Emmitsburg system can be activated both by the Frederick County Department of Emergency Communications which includes the county s Fire Rescue Dispatch Center as well as from the town itself The system will be tested weekly via a non audible paper test but periodic audible tests are being considered so citizens know the system is operational and what it sounds like when activated top Back to the Top Fallen Firefighter Memorial

technical review of the response to the Texas A M University bonfire collapse which killed 12 university students and graduates was released in November According to the review emergency responders dealing with such challenging emergencies must think big in terms of ordering additional resources immediately to meet possible management needs The report also showed the importance of pre incident planning In this case there had been a tabletop exercise with city and university responders just one week prior to the event and the university s emergency management service personnel had conducted a drill just two weeks before Other lessons learned cited in the report include The advantages of having electric power and hardwired telephone lines brought to the scene s command post to help with communications as the magnitude of the emergency quickly exceeded the capabilities of the emergency responder communications systems and the telecommunications system of the community and two local hospitals The need to consider redirecting non critical patients to other medical facilities in an event involving multiple casualties since the capabilities of local hospitals can be easily overwhelmed The need to provide additional staffing to hospitals which may need help in a multi casualty incident to assist with unloading patients and dealing with families and friends of the injured and The need to control rumors So much misinformation was broadcast following the collapse that two local hospitals turned off their television sets to reduce anxiety A press release sent out about the report erroneously noted that an incident command system was not in place The error was corrected in a statement issued from U S Fire Administrator R David Paulison Texas A M University is located in College Station Texas and has an annual enrollment of more than 40 000 students The university is the site of a training school for firefighters and the headquarters of Texas Task Force One a FEMA Urban Search and Rescue team As part of a 90 year old tradition 58 people were working to construct the fourth tier of the bonfire stack on the campus in the early morning hours of Nov 18 1999 The 40 foot stack consisting of some 5 000 logs collapsed without warning In addition to the 12 deaths another 27 people were injured The rescue effort began immediately as emergency personnel were on the site at the time of the collapse and lasted almost 24 hours Listening devices and search cameras were used to locate trapped victims A full copy of the report can be found at fire service techreports
