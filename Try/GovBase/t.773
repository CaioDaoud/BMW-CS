Poppe mailto lpoppe usgs gov lpoppe usgs gov The Long Island Sound estuarine system Long Island Sound LIS and the New York Bight New York Bight NYB offshore of the New York New Jersey metropolitan area are heavily used and the seafloor has been affected by human activities There has been widespread contamination of the bottom sediments and degradation of benthic habitats Currently this project is synthesizing results of earlier field and laboratory studies of the sediment dynamics geochemical processes that control the distribution of contaminants and areas of benthic habitats The project s long term goal is to develop predictive capabilities for pollutant and sediment mobility and fate that can be used to guide appropriate and sustainable use of the coastal waters of Long Island Sound

formed of water and gas It looks and acts much like ice but it contains huge amounts of methane and it exists in very large quantities in marine sediments in a layer several hundred meters thick directly below the sea floor and in association with permafrost in the Arctic It is important for three reasons 1 It may become a major energy resource 2 It has important effects on sea floor sediment stability influencing collapse and landsliding 3 The hydrate reservoir may have strong influence on climate as methane is a significant greenhouse gas This project seeks to learn to identify gas hydrate by remote sensing and to understand the processes that control methane hydrate in the natural environment such as concentration into possibly extractable accumulations change in strength of sediments and generation of overpressures processes of seafloor mobilization and processes allowing transfer of methane to the atmosphere Submerged Paleo shorelines of the U S Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico Coasts Project start date 10 01 2000 Project end date 09 30 2003 E Robert Thieler mailto rthieler usgs gov rthieler usgs gov K Scanlon Catanach mailto kscanlon usgs gov kscanlon usgs gov Steven M Colman mailto scolman usgs gov scolman usgs gov Several USGS mapping projects along the East Coast and eastern Gulf of Mexico continental shelf have discovered paleo shoreline deposits from at least three discrete sea level stillstands during the most recent deglacial episode Each stillstand was terminated by a rapid rise event Currently there are are predictions that we may be facing a more rapid sea level rise like that which characterized most of the late Quaternary This project will study seven sites of paleo shorelines having a wide range of geologic settings and different tectonic and isostatic histories with the object of learning how the modern coastal system might respond to a renewed period of rapid sea level rise South Carolina Coastal Erosion Study Phase II Project start

usgs gov rmorton usgs gov St Petersburg FL The primary goal of the USGS Coastal Erosion Study in South Carolina is to learn to predict coastal change erosion and accretion by achieving an understanding of factors that control sediment movement This work is being done in close collaboration with Coastal Carolina University and the University of South Carolina We are finding that much of the shoreline behavior on the Atlantic coast is influenced by the locations of resistant or easily eroded sediments along the shore which owe their nature to the antecedent geologic environment By using surface sediment distribution subsurface stratigraphy of the lower shoreface and inner shelf and subaerial components of the coastal system to interpret and map the pre existing coastal features a conceptual understanding of the present sediment dynamics can be seen that results from the sequence of pre existing coastal conditions Over the three years of the project the inner shelf and lower shoreface will be mapped using high resolution sidescan sonar subbottom profilers CHIRP Geopulse boomer fathometer interferometric sidescan bathymetry and sediment samples http www glaciers er usgs

1999 Project end date 09 30 2004 William P Dillon mailto bdillon usgs gov bdillon usgs gov Uri Ten Brink mailto utenbrink usgs gov utenbrink usgs gov Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands are located at an active plate boundary between the North American plate and the northeast corner of the Caribbean plate where there is a significant seismic risk Plate movements have caused large 7 5 8 magnitude earthquakes Large tsunamis have hit Puerto Rico and Hispaniola reportedly killing 1800 people in 1946 and 91 people in 1918 Knowledge of the causative mechanisms and the likely hazards of earthquakes and tsunamis will improve the safety of residents and protection of coastal resources because government agencies and the public can use the information to improve building codes encourage safer zoning and assist public education for response to hazards This project is a study of the plate motions the shallow and deep coupling between the plates mapping the resultant shallow and deep plate

250 kilometers longshore distance of the inner shelf shoreface and coastal area between Duck and Cape Lookout to 10 kilometers offshore It lies in part off the Cape Hatteras National Seashore and Pea

systematic program of measurement on Cape Cod 45 kilometers of coast and Cape Hatteras 130 kilometers of coast with intensive surveys in response to storms and regularly scheduled surveys bi weekly on Cape Cod monthly on Cape Hatteras designed to continually update pre storm information The primary objective of this project is to understand the processes causing storm induced erosional hotspots and in doing so to develop a method for predicting their locations prior to future storm impacts Secondary objectives are to provide data for evaluating the error in long term shoreline change assessments
