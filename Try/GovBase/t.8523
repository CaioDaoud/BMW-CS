to changes in travel patterns needs and emerging technologies and materials Over the years those changes have resulted from research experimentation and practical experience with the best and most effective devices and practices being implemented Because of the potential for change FHWA officials continually review and consider requests for interpretations experimentations and changes to the information contained in the MUTCD This section examines the process by which decisions are made to revise amend or create MUTCD standards Amendment Process for Revising the MUTCD When the FHWA assumed responsibility for updating the MUTCD in 1979 the agency announced that it would process all future changes to the MUTCD through notices in the Federal Register This means that before any suggested revision is accepted it must go through the 2 step Federal Register rulemaking process a process designed to ensure public involvement Notice of Proposed Amendments NPA FHWA publishes requests for changes to the MUTCD in the Federal Register to give the public an opportunity to provide comments These public comments are considered in making a Final Rule kno millennium npa htm Click here to view the kno millennium npa htm Notice of Proposed Amendments Final Ruling FR The Final Rule describes the FHWA s final decision concerning requests for changes to the MUTCD This decision can include the following adopt a change defer the change pending further research or adopt a modification to the change Based on docket comments and or other additional information received pdfs amendment pdf Click here to view a flowchart of the amendment process PDF file 6K This above process is important because it ensures that all parties have the opportunity to offer opinions and concerns about proposed changes to the MUTCD The FHWA considers all comments whether from private individuals trade organizations or the NCUTCD before issuing a Final Rule which is also published in the Federal Register Request an Interpretation If you are unclear about an existing standard or would like clarification or interpretation or a proposed or adopted amendment submit your written request to Federal Highway Administration Office of Transportation Operations HOTO 400 7th Street SW Washington DC 20590 Change or Update an MUTCD Standard If you feel that a change should be made to an existing standard in the MUTCD or you believe that there should be a new standard added submit your written request for changes for MUTCD standards to Federal Highway Administration Office of Transportation Operations HOTO 400 7th Street SW Washington DC 20590 If the FHWA concludes that the change has merit it will begin the Rulemaking Process outlined process above For additional information refer to the wording of HTM millennium 12 28 01 one general MUTCD part1 htm section1A10 MUTCD Section IA 10 Changes Interpretations and Experimentations To Conduct an Experimentation If you think you have an idea for a new traffic control device or a different application of an existing device that will improve driver safety but the device hasn t been included in the MUTCD it is possible to experiment with the device or its use This experimentation is conducted in a controlled setting All requests for experimentation should originate with the State local highway agency or toll operator responsible for managing the roadway or controlled setting where experiment will take place That organization forwards the request to the FHWA with a courtesy copy to the FHWA Division Office The FHWA must approve the experiment before it begins Requests may also be forwarded directly to the FHWA Division Office and the Division Office can submit the request to the FHWA Headquarters Office All requests must include A statement of the nature of the problem including data that justifies the need for a new device or application Describe the proposed change how it was developed how it deviates from the current standard Any illustration s that enhance understanding of the device or its use Supporting data that explains how the experimental device was developed if it has been tried the adequacy of its performance and the process by which the device was chosen or applied An agreement to restore the experimental site to a condition that complies with the provisions of the MUTCD within 3 months following completion of the experiment The agreement must also provide that the sponsoring agency will terminate the experiment at any time if it determines that the experiment directly or indirectly causes significant safety hazards If the experiment demonstrates an improvement the device or application may remain in place as a request is made to update the MUTCD and an official rulemaking action occurs An agreement to provide semiannual progress reports for the duration of the experimentation and to provide a copy of the final results to the Office of Transportation Operations HOTO within three months of the conclusion of the experiment HOTO may terminate approval of the experimentation if these reports are not provided on schedule pdfs experiment pdf Click here to view a flowchart of the experimentation process PDF file 7K A successful experiment is one where the research results show that the public understands the new device or application the device or application generally performs as intended and the device does not cause adverse conditions The experimenter must evaluate conditions both before and after installation of the experimental device and
