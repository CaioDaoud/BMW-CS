http perry geo berkeley edu seismo hayward seismicity hist 1906 html Steinbrugge Collection of the UC Berkeley Earthquake Engineering Research Center The California earthquake of April 18 1906 ranks as one of the most significant earthquakes of all time Today its importance comes more from the wealth of scientific knowledge derived from it than from its sheer size Rupturing the northernmost 430 kilometers of the San Andreas fault from northwest of San Juan Bautista to the triple junction at Cape Mendocino the earthquake confounded contemporary geologists with its large horizontal displacements and great rupture length Indeed the significance of the fault and recognition of its large cumulative offset would not be fully appreciated until the advent of plate tectonics more than half a century later Analysis of the 1906 displacements and strain in the surrounding crust led Reid 1910 to formulate his elastic rebound theory of the earthquake source which remains today the principal model of the earthquake cycle At almost precisely 5 12 a m local time a foreshock occurred with sufficient force to be felt widely throughout the San Francisco Bay area The great earthquake broke loose some 20 to 25 seconds later with an epicenter near San Francisco Violent shocks punctuated the strong shaking which lasted some 45 to 60 seconds The earthquake was felt from southern Oregon to south of Los Angeles and inland as far as central Nevada The highest Modified Mercalli Intensities MMI s of VII to IX paralleled the length of the rupture extending as far as 80 kilometers inland from the fault trace One important characteristic of the shaking intensity noted in Lawson s 1908 report was the clear correlation of intensity with underlying geologic conditions Areas situated in sediment filled valleys sustained stronger shaking than nearby bedrock sites and the strongest shaking occurred in areas where ground reclaimed from San Francisco Bay failed in the earthquake Modern seismic zonation practice accounts for the differences in seismic hazard posed by varying geologic conditions As a basic reference about the earthquake and the damage it caused geologic observations of the fault rupture and shaking effects and other consequences of the earthquake the Lawson 1908 report remains the authoritative work as well as arguably the most important study of a single earthquake In the public s mind this earthquake is perhaps remembered most for the fire it spawned in San Francisco giving it the somewhat misleading appellation of the San Francisco earthquake Shaking damage however was equally severe in many other places along the fault rupture The frequently quoted value of 700 deaths caused by the earthquake and fire is now believed to underestimate the total loss of life by a factor of 3 or 4 Most of the fatalities occurred in San Francisco and 189 were reported elsewhere Excerpted from references html ellsworth Ellsworth 1990 This
