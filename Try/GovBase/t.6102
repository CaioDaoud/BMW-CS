Advanced Light Source WHY DO SCIENTISTS USE THE ADVANCED LIGHT SOURCE A TOOL THE SIZE OF A FOOTBALL FIELD TO LEARN ABOUT STRUCTURES AS TINY AS ATOMS AND MOLECULES What s going on inside this building The ALS is a research facility used by scientists to Explore the properties of materials Analyze samples for trace elements Probe the structure of atoms and molecules Study biological specimens Investigate chemical reactions Manufacture microscopic machines The ALS produces light principally x rays with special qualities Scientists use these x rays as a tool to do their work just as dentists use x rays as a tool Many scientists working on different projects can use the ALS at the same time For example one scientist might be checking samples of mud for tiny amounts of a toxic contaminant while another might be investigating a polymer to find out how its molecules are arranged Fact X rays have shorter wavelengths than visible light But both are light also called EMSpec electromagnetic radiation Why is the ALS so large To produce light of the wavelengths and brightness that scientists want the ALS designers had to create a large machine Its largest component the storage ring has a diameter two thirds the length of a football field The storage ring is a tubular vacuum chamber made to Hold an electron beam travelling through it at nearly the speed of light Maintain the high energy of the electron beam As the electrons circle the ring they give off light The ring must be as big as it is to maintain the electron beam at 1 5 1 9 billion electron volts the energy required to produce light of the desired wavelengths and brightness For more information see ALS Components ALS Components Fact Light produced by machines that operate like the ALS is called synchrotron radiation ALS floor diagram Why is light from the ALS a useful tool The ALS produces light in the far ultraviolet and soft x ray regions of the EMSpec EMSpec2 html electromagnetic spectrum This light has wavelengths from 0 0001 micrometer to 0 1 micrometer Which object is closest in length to a micrometer micrometer html a submarine an ant the diameter of a human hair a virus Here are some reasons why light from the ALS is a good tool for exploring materials Reason 1 Light from the ALS can penetrate materials Just as your dentist uses x rays to see inside your gums scientists use the light from the ALS to look inside materials Dental x ray Why do dental x rays penetrate your gums and not your teeth Teeth html Reason 2 It is impossible to see anything smaller than the wavelength of the light you are using So to study atoms or molecules you must use light waves about their size or smaller The ALS produces light with wavelengths about the sizes of atoms molecules chemical bonds and the distances between atomic planes in crystals Atoms chemical bonds and the distances between atomic planes in crystals all measure a few angstroms about the same as the wavelengths of light from the ALS Reason 3 Photons or particles of light from the ALS have the right energies to interact with many electrons in atoms The diagram below shows what can happen when light shines on a material Electrons may absorb the photons energy and escape from the material as shown at the top of the diagram Scientists in the late 19th century observed this phenomenon and called it the photoelectric effect OR Electrons in the atoms of the material may absorb the photons energy and jump to a higher energy level When an electron does this its atom is said to be excited Soon the electron loses the extra energy and returns to a lower level a process called de excitation Often this lost energy escapes from the atom in the form of photons Excitation and de excitation are shown at the bottom of the diagram Also you may observe no interaction Can you guess why Scientists at the ALS detect and analyze the escaping electrons or photons to learn more about the structure and behavior of atoms and the materials in which they are found Analyses like these serve many purposes for example Detecting the presence and quantity of trace elements from their unique emission patterns see MicroWorlds Wetlands Selenium A Window On Wetlands Providing images that show the structure of materials see MicroWorlds Kevlar Kevlar the Wonder Material Reason 4 The ALSis one of America s brightest soft x ray sources available for researchers The x rays produced here are a hundred million times brighter than those from the most powerful x ray tube the source used in a dentist s machine High brightness means that the x rays are highly concentrated Many x ray photons per second can be directed onto a tiny area of a material left Brighter right not so bright Reason 5 Besides their brightness x rays from the ALS have other useful characteristics such as tunability near coherence pulsed nature and polarization Since the ALS produces x rays why couldn t scientists just use an x ray tube as a dentist does instead of the ALS Here are some facts ALS X Rays X Rays Produced by an X Ray Tube Penetrate matter Penetrate matter Have wavelengths near the size of atoms and molecules Have wavelengths smaller than the sizes of many atoms and molecules Have the right energies to interact with electrons in light atoms such as carbon and oxygen Have energies too high to interact with many electrons in light atoms but can interact with those in heavy atoms such as gold ALS soft x rays are brighter than any other x ray source in America similar to the light from a laser Are not bright enough for high resolution experiments more like a floodlight than a laser Are produced in tiny pulses constantly for 6 hours or more Can be produced in a single short burst i e dental x ray tube X ray tubes are found in the laboratory as well as in dental offices and continue to be used for many experiments But the ALS has advantages over x ray tubes when it comes to investigating most materials An obvious advantage is the length of time the x ray beam lasts A beam from the ALS continues for hours while the beam from an x ray tube is often limited A scientist could not use the light generated by an x ray tube for experiments that take much time for example scanning the surface of a material for impurities Also x rays from the ALS have the right energies to interact with many electrons in lighter atoms which make up most common materials Interaction must take place otherwise an experiment will not yield information X ray tubes produce photons with higher energy than those from the ALS an advantage for imaging objects made of very heavy elements such as gold Au But these energetic photons would pass right through materials made up of light atoms and not interact at all The greatest advantage of the ALS is its brightness You could compare an x ray beam from the ALS with a laser and one from an x ray tube with a floodlight While they both might deliver an equal number of photons per second those from the ALS are concentrated on a small area whereas those from the x ray tube are widely scattered A higher concentration of photons on a smaller area allows scientists to increase the specificity of their experiments They can study smaller objects or choose more specific photon energies down to tenths of electron volts to study a very specific target Activity If you could use the ALS or an x ray tube as your source of photons which would you choose to solve the following problems 1 I have a material suspected to be contaminated with small amounts of copper Cu If it is contaminated I need to know how the copper is distributed in the material Which x ray source should I use and why Dummy html 2 I need photons with an energy of exactly 285 5 eV electron volts Photons with this energy are absorbed by an aromatic group in a fiber I am studying and I want to make an image of the fiber s cross section Which x ray source should I use and why Dummy html 3 Archaeologists have found a sealed urn and suspect that it contains gold Au coins Which x ray source would I use to determine the presence of the coins and why Dummy html 4 I m a curator for a large art museum and I need to know if this urn is genuine before we purchase it from the art dealer All of the art historians say that the style of the urn and the designs painted on it are from the same time period and location as that which the dealer claims However I have reason to believe that the urn might be a reproduction from another time period The art conservation literature states that a distinguishing characteristic from this time period is the presence of manganese Mn in a layer of pigment Which x ray source should I use to determine whether there is manganese in the pigment and why Dummy html 5 I need an x ray source to determine how quickly a chemical compound found in automobile exhaust is converted to a component of smog It is suspected that this compound is converted at very fast rates in picoseconds Picoseconds are trillionths of a second Which source of x rays should I use to detect the change Dummy html 6 I fell down and I heard a crack My arm hurts a LOT Which x ray source should be used to tell if my arm is broken and why Dummy html MicroWorlds ALSTool ALS Components ALS Components MicroWorlds Contents MicroWorlds Contents http mworlds lbl gov index html Registration Comments
