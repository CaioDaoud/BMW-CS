Research Overview Safely getting people where they need to go is the Federal Highway Administration s FHWA top priority Our Nation has nearly four million miles of roadway and more drivers than anytime before The chance of being involved in a crash is always a concern FHWA s primary focus areas are bulleted item Intersections Intersections bulleted item Bicyclist Pedestrian and Bicyclist Safety bulleted item Roadside Roadside Safety bulleted item Road Run Off Road Safety bulleted item Speed Speed Management Supporting areas include bulleted item Geometric Geometric Design Laboratory bulleted item PVL Photometric and Visibility Laboratory bulleted item Human Human Centered Systems Studies bulleted item Safety Safety Management Assessments Primary Research Areas Intersections FHWA is initiating a new research focus area on intersection safety Intersection and intersection related crashes consistently make up a high proportion of total fatal crashes up to 23 percent More than 50 percent of the combined fatal and injury crashes occur at intersections AASHTO s Strategic Highway Safety Plan identifies intersect htm more Pedestrian and Bicyclist Safety Every trip begins and ends with walking This research focuses on identifying pedestrian and bicyclist problem areas developing analysis tools for planners and engineers to better understand and target problems and evaluating infrastructure countermeasures to improve pedestrian and bicycle safety pedbike pedbike htm more Roadside Safety crash index htm Centers of Excellence in Finite Element Crash Analysis about foil htm

Analysis of Roadside Hardware Features Run Off Road Safety This research emphases keeping vehicles on the roadway and minimizing the consequences of leaving the roadway Development of the http wwwcf fhwa dot gov exit cfm link http www ihsdm org Interactive Highway Safety Design Model and the research in enhanced driver visibility are key study areas This area supports the objectives of AASHTO s Strategic Highway Safety Plan Speed Management With the repeal of the NMSL there is renewed interest on how best to set and enforce speed limits Speed management is a complex issue involving engineering and behavioral factors This research is developing and testing engineering measures and technologies to manage speeds and encourage wider adoption of travel speeds appropriate for the class of road roadway design and travel conditions Supporting Research Areas Geometric Design Laboratory The mission of the about gdl htm Geometric Design Laboratory is to provide technical support to the Office of Safety Research and Development to develop the http wwwcf fhwa dot gov exit cfm link http www ihsdm org Interactive Highway Safety Design Model IHSDM a suite of software tools for the safety evaluation of highway geometric design alternatives The full two lane rural road version of IHSDM is scheduled for public release in 2002 A rural multilane version is scheduled for release in 2006 Photometric and Visibility Laboratory about pvl htm The Photometric and Visibility Laboratory PVL supports the Visibility Program at TFHRC The Visibility Program is directed towards research for near term improvement of the visibility on and along the roadway and of traffic control devices to enhance the safety of road users The Visibility Program also promotes opportunities that advance new practices and technologies to improve visibility on a cost effective basis The PVL investigates the effectiveness of innovative means of marking signing signaling and lighting through direct photometric and or colorimetric measurements and by supporting human centered studies of the effectiveness of new technologies about pvl htm more Human Centered Systems Studies Research shows inappropriate driver perceptions and behaviors are implicated in 80 percent to 90 percent of highway crashes FHWA is seeking an increased understanding and analytic description of road user needs for all roadway classifications and operating conditions including bicycle paths sidewalks and crosswalks traffic control devices and other safety countermeasures humanfac hf htm more Safety Management Assessments The primary objective of safety management is to ensure that highway safety resources are appropriately allocated to maximize the reduction of the frequency and severity of all types of highway crashes Crashes are the result of multiple errors design traffic control and user The focus of this area includes identification of safety problems development of analysis tools and knowledge
