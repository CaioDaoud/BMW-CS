Abstract of nowCOAST website nC credits htm Credits for the nowCOAST portal nC disclaimer htm Disclaimer of nowCOAST website Abstract An estuary as well as the people who live within its boundaries is affected daily by changes in weather oceanographic and river conditions The physical changes within many estuaries are monitored in real time by NOAA and other federal state and educational observing networks Future short term changes in weather and river conditions are forecasted by NOAA numerical prediction models In addition NOAA is developing the capability to forecast oceanographic conditions in estuaries and the coastal ocean To provide National Ocean Service NOS forecast model developers and the coastal community easy and centralized access to online real time physical meteorological oceanographic river and air water quality information Coast Survey Development Laboratory CSDL has developed a spatially referenced Web portal In addition to this observation data the Web portal also provides NOAA forecasts for major estuaries seaports and adjacent coastal regions as well as the Great Lakes The portal nowCOAST was constructed using ESRI s off the shelf GIS software ArcIMS NowCoast contains links to a variety of outside sources The ownership of the web sites to which the portal is linked will be clearly visible and retained by them while the integrity of the nowCoast Web portal connection will be maintained by CSDL Presently the portal provides links to oceanographic and or weather observations NOS PORTS and National Water Level Observation Network stations National Data
