which are protected from disclosure by one of the Exemptions contained in the FOIA The language of the FOIA and the FLRA s regulations governs any conflict that may arise between the guidance offered here and those provisions What should your request for information contain Your request must be in writing We do not accept telephone call requests for information You should clearly mark your envelope as a FOIA Request Your letter should identify what record or parts of a record that you are seeking as legibly and concisely as possible Describe the records in sufficient detail that they will be able to be located with due diligence Please include a telephone number where you may be reached during the day in case it is necessary to contact you to clarify your request Our experience

align left solid style line height 100 margin left 0 margin top 0 margin bottom 0 regs 1999 c2411 4 html The FOIA requires that all Federal agencies respond to requests within 20 business days Generally unlike most Federal agencies the OGC and the seven Regions do not have backlogs of FOIA requests and routinely respond to such requests in within 20 business days On rare occasions it may take longer than 20 days to respond to a request For example a request may be made for a document in a case file that no longer resides in the Regional Office In that instance it may be necessary to request that the record which has been sent to another Federal facility to be archived be returned to the Region to respond to the request This sometimes may take longer In any event the FOIA Officer will either call you to discuss this matter or send you a letter apprising you of the situation and a date which you can expect a response p align left solid style line height 100 margin left 0 margin
