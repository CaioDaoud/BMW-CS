muenchen de en aktuell html given permission for the startup of the http www frm2 tu muenchen de index en html FRM II reactor in Garching Germany after delays due to concern about the use of enriched uranium fuel The director writes that they expect now a period of 10 to 12 months for taking FRM II into full operation The first criticality is foreseen in August to September and first neutrons at the instruments are expected early autumn 2003 This period will finish with several weeks of full operation at 20 MW The following routine operation foresees a maximum of five cycles each of 52 days leading up to 260 days operation per year Wednesday April 8 2003 In a http www gnn gov uk gnn national nsf TI 15C805D19BBA41BD80256D02004ADE9A opendocument press release the UK governement announced that it had committed 100M for the construction of a http www isis rl ac uk targetstation2 second target station at the ISIS Pulsed Neutron and Muon Facility sited at the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory Lord Sainsbury the Science and Innovation Minister said This 100 million for the ISIS laboratory is a key part of our investment strategy in major facilities for scientists in this country It will keep the UK at the forefront of neutron research for many years Wednesday December 4 2002 On December 4 2002 the Governments of France Germany and the United Kingdom agreed to an extension of the 1971 Inter governmental Convention on the international research institute known as the Institut Max von Laue Paul Langevin ILL in Grenoble France for ten years The Protocol was signed in Paris by Mrs Claudie Haigner Minister delegate for Research and New Technologies and the Ambassadors of Germany and the United Kingdom in France Mr Fritjof von Nordenskj ld and Sir John Holmes It prolongs the duration of the Convention and related subsequent agreements to the year 2013 thus guaranteeing continuity in the field of fundamental and applied research with neutrons at the ILL Thursday October 17 2002 The National Research Council of Canada has announced that Dr Bill Buyers Chalk River Laboratories has been awarded a Commemorative Medal created as part of Queen Elizabeth s Golden Jubilee to honor those who have made a significant contribution to Canada The http neutron nrc cnrc gc ca news 200210buyers html NRC announcement cites his development of neutron scattering techniques for the study of magnetic phenomena in metals and insulators and for his leadership role in the Canadian neutron scattering community Tuesday September 3 2002 The Institute of Physics http physics iop org IOP Press PR7002 html has just announced that Dr Sean Langridge has been awarded the Charles Vernon Boys Prize which recognizes distinguished research in experimental physics by scientists under the age of 35 His work at both ESRF and ISIS have allowed him to develop and exploit the most modern experimental techniques in the study of magnetic materials in particular magnetic thin films Tuesday July 2 2002 The US Office of Science Technology Policy OSTP has just published a Report on the Status and Needs of Major Neutron Scattering Facilities and Instruments in the United States containing the results of an interagency working group chaired by Patrick Gallagher NIST The main recommendations as summarized by John Marburger the OSTP director are that the United States 1 focus on developing high quality instrumentation at the best sources 2 establish a framework for using interagency partnerships to develop neutron instrumentation that ensures balanced use and access 3 improve the coordination among all stakeholders in the nation s neutron facilities agencies facility management and users and 4 invest in advancing the state of the art in neutron sources and methods The 63 page report is available as a PDF file at http www ostp gov html NeutronIWGReport pdf http www ostp gov html NeutronIWGReport pdf Thursday August 9 2001 Jane Brown has been awarded the 2001 Walter H lg Prize of the European Neutron Scattering Association in recognition of her outstanding contributions to the science of neutron scattering over the last four decades In making mail archive 0555 html the announcement Prof Cywinski wrote that Professor Brown has made a significant impact upon our understanding of the fundamental magnetic properties of materials through her contributions to both the development and exploitation of polarised neutron diffraction and advanced spherical neutron polarimetry techniques for the precise determination of complex magnetic structures and spin density
