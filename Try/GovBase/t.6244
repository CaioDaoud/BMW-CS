Fermilab Proton Antiproton Collider styles css index html Home Fermilab Proton Antiproton Collider http www fnal gov Fermilab Home Page The basic idea of colliding protons p and antiprotons pbar in Fermilab was proposed in 1976 by D Cline P McIntyre and C Rubbia using its existing accelerator With the invention of beam cooling techniques S Van der Meer et al Physics Report 58 1980 73 it became possible to make colliding beams of protons and antiprotons Such a development led to build the first p pbar collider at a center of mass energy Ecm of 0 63 TeV at http www cern ch CERN and to discover the weak W and Z bosons in 1983 The weak bosons are one of four strong electromagnetic weak and gravitational force carriers which is predicted by the Standard Model periodic table of elementary particles in http txpc1 fnal gov 7Ekamon brochure pt top95 standard model gif GIF or http txpc1 fnal gov 7Ekamon brochure pt top95 standard model pdf PDF or http txpc1 fnal gov 7Ekamon brochure pt top95 standard model ps PostScript the theory of elementary particles and forces that determine the fundamental nature of matter and energy With the development of superconducting accelerator magnets it became possible to extend the energy reach in collisions upto 2 TeV at Fermilab The Fermilab Tevatron collider is currently the world s highest energy accelerator colliding antiprotons with protons at Ecm 1 8 TeV The first collisions were produced and 23 of them were detected in October of 1985 The Tevatron performance has evolved to reach the instantaneous luminosity of 2 x 1031 cm 1s 1 or a collision rate of 1 MHz with production of approximately 1000 pairs of pt top95 collision gif top t and antitop tbar quarks leading to the http www fnal gov pub top95 discovery of the top quark by the http www cdf fnal gov CDF and http www d0 fnal gov DZero collaborations in 1995 The top quark as the partner of the bottom quark that was discovered at Fermilab in 1977 has been a missing link and is required if the Standard Model is correct The Tevatron is being upgraded to provide 2 TeV collisions with a peak luminosity of 2 x 1032 cm 1s 1 or 10 MHz for Run II 2001 2003 to increase the discovery potential of the Higgs boson required by the Standard Model and Supersymmetry Top Prepared by Teruki Kamon December 7 1999 Last Update April 7 2000
