Sengers Johanna Maria Henrica Levelt Sengers Scientist Emeritus Chemical Science and Technology Laboratory Physical and Chemical Properties Division Johanna Anneke Levelt Sengers a native of the Netherlands received a PhD in physics at the University of Amsterdam and joined the National Bureau of Standards presently NIST in 1963 She works in the area of the thermodynamics and properties of fluids and fluid mixtures in the region around their critical points She served as a Group Leader from 1978 1987 became a NIST Senior Fellow in 1984 and retired in 1995 She presently holds Scientist Emeritus status at NIST Dr Levelt Sengers expertise is in the application of the critical point scaling laws to fluids of industrial importance such as water and steam in electric power cycles She is a past President of the International Association for the Properties of Water and Steam IAPWS and the US national representative to IAPWS on behalf of ASME She and her colleagues have published thermodynamic data correlations for ethylene water and steam and other fluids of industrial interest With her collaborators she has worked on the laws governing the behavior of dilute mixtures near critical points and on criticality of ionic fluids on which she published a recent review She has written tutorial chapters on the properties of supercritical fluids as solvents and she coorganized the first NATO Summer School on Supercritical Fluids in 1994 Her current interests focus on the history of her field in the Netherlands around 1900 On this topic she published the book How Fluids Unmix in 2002 Dr Levelt Sengers is a member of the National Academy of Engineering and the National Academy of Sciences and a correspondent of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences She is a Fellow of APS AAAS and IAPWS She holds an honorary doctorate from the Technical University of Delft Netherlands She is the recipient of the Department of Commerce Silver medal 1972 and Gold Medal 1978 and is the North American recipient of the 2003 L Or al UNESCO Women in Science Award Selected Publications Levelt Sengers Johanna and Levelt Antonius H M Diederik Korteweg pioneer of criticality
