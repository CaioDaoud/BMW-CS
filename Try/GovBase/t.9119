Rockville MD Westat Inc Keywords Survey estimates estimation methods sampling errors measurement errors non sampling errors estimation issues Alternate Contact Person Mary Collins SESTAT Survey NSRCG Abstract The NSRCG and IPEDS both produce estimates of the number of graduates and number of degree awards by race Comparing the estimates from 1991 through 1994 showed that the total number of graduates from each survey differed by 4 to 5 percent for bachelor s degree recipients and 10 to 15 percent for master s degree recipients This paper examines the reasons for these differences including differences in the design or reporting procedures used in the two surveys It also attempts to quantify the amount of difference that may be attributable to each cause The main topics of discussion include differences in the survey s target populations data collection methods and statistical procedures The investigation reveals that the NSRCG and IPEDS estimates are comparable when adjustments are made for differences in target populations and for the sampling errors of the NSRCG estimates http srsstats sbe nsf gov docs research 1 41 pdf 1 41 pdf Burns Genny 1996 1993 National

done as part of the 1993 NSCG dealing with sample frame issues It involved a followup study of 78 respondents who switched from Science and Engineering S E status to non S E status and vice versa during a reinterview of NSCG 93 participants Based on the results of the reinterview it was estimated that 6 6 percent of the non S E respondents in NSCG 93 would switch to S E if reinterviewed which could lead to undercoverage in NSCG 95 During the followup study several switchers were contacted for a brief interview to evaluate the accuracy of the undercoverage estimate The responses of the switchers were also examined to determine if there were any patterns in reporting responses that might suggest problems with questionnaire wording http srsstats sbe nsf gov docs research 1 51 pdf 1 51

as part of the 1993 NSCG dealing with sample frame issues During NSCG 93 about 8 5 percent of the respondents were classified as out of scope because they had not earned a bachelor s degree or higher by 1990 This was cause for some concern as the NSCG 93 sample was drawn from a set of persons in the 1990 decennial census who reported having received a bachelor s degree or higher A sample of 300 out of scope cases were contacted for followup interviews in 1995 to determine how many were misclassified in 1993 An examination was also made of the unusually high percentage of cases with no bachelor s degrees that were completed by Field Representatives FRs during NSCG 93 Even after excluding the work done by FRs and accounting for 20 percent of the followup respondents saying they had earned bachelor s degrees by 1990 the no bachelor s degree rate of 6 1 percent was still higher than the results of the Census content reinterview survey of the 1990 decennial census http srsstats sbe

one of a group of special research projects done as part of the 1993 NSCG dealing with sample frame issues During NSCG 93 all respondents that were classified as out of scope because they were not living in the United States during the reference week were permanently dropped from the NSCG sample due to the poor prospects and high costs of completing future interviews This followup study interviewed 100 persons classified as out of scope during the NSCG 95 study to determine how many people would have been eligible to participate in NSCG 95 Based on the results of the followup it was determined that permanently excluding out of scope individuals contributed a maximum of 34 percent to NSCG 95 undercoverage http srsstats sbe nsf gov docs research 1 71 pdf 1 71 pdf Finn Michael and Baker Joe G 1996 Reconciling Estimates of U S Doctorates Oak Ridge TN Oak Ridge Institute for Science and Education Keywords Population coverage educational and occupational definitions Alternate Contact Person Nirmala Kannankutty SESTAT Surveys NSCG SDR Abstract This investigation addresses differences in estimates of U S doctorates from the NSCG and SDR The authors address problems associated with definitions of eligible persons respondent misrepresentation inflation of educational credentials and differences in the treatment of various fields of study and occupations that bear on eligibility The authors address the question of the degree of discrepancy attributable to these measurement problems but note the inability to quantify the contribution of each with any degree of confidence Note This report led to the understanding that in the NSCG93 some doctors of medicine MDs had incorrectly reported their degrees in the Doctorate i e PhD degree category The 1993 NSCG data was then re edited to insure that respondents working as physicians had their degree recorded as a Professional Degree e g MD rather than a Doctorate In addition labeling on later SESTAT surveys was changed to make the Doctorate Professional degree distinction clearer to respondents http srsstats sbe nsf gov docs research 1 81 pdf 1 81 pdf Hicks Lloyd and Moore Thomas F III 1996 Quality of

information address checks analysis of bad name cases Alternate Contact Person Nirmala Kannankutty SESTAT Survey NSCG 93 Abstract This paper reports on two investigations of the quality of the initial names and addresses used for NSCG 93 The first study examines the quality of locating information that was obtained from various locating services based on the initial address provided The second study examines several demographic variables to determine if any subdomains experienced a disproportionately large number of unmailable cases due to bad names The distribution of bad name cases is compared to that of the final NSCG sample for five variables highest degree occupation age sex and a special NSF variable that incorporates race ethnicity disability status citizenship status and place of birth It was found that the distribution of bad name cases was statistically different from the distribution of the NSCG 93 final sample for all variables except sex 2 Sample Design http

SESTAT Surveys New Entrants NSRCG NSCG SDR Abstract As part of a major survey redesign effort undertaken by the National Science Foundation in the 1990s it was necessary to develop integrated sampling goals and principles for the survey system and to overcome previously experienced sampling problems This paper examines the survey sampling frames and coverage as well as changes made to each of the three component surveys on science and engineering graduates and personnel It also discusses sample design goals and issues and sample allocation guidelines that were used in the 1993 SESTAT surveys

cooperation rates nonresponse bias data quality Alternate Contact Person Dave Edson Survey population Three year old retired CPS sample of college educated people Abstract This paper discusses a 1992 pretest for the NSCG Using four treatment groups the goal of the study was to determine the effect of questionnaire length and the use of incentives on the cooperation rate reducing S E bias data quality and commitment One of the four groups received a long form version of the questionnaire and a 5 check in the first mailing A second group also received the long form version of the questionnaire but without the monetary incentive The other two treatment groups received shorter questionnaires without any financial incentives The authors found that without an incentive questionnaire length is inversely proportional to the cooperation rate They also determined that using an incentive could significantly increase the cooperation rate for a mail survey with one mailing The results also showed that data quality was not affected by questionnaire length or use of an incentive S E bias was only marginally reduced by using incentives and commitment to being contacted for followups increased with questionnaire length and the use of incentives http srsstats sbe nsf gov docs research 3 51 pdf 3 51 pdf Moonesinghe Ramal Mitchell Susan and Pasquini Daniel 1995 An

case and length of the field period for SDR 93 In order to conduct the study the SDR 93 sample was divided into three groups foreign mailing addresses were excluded Group 1 received a first class mailing followed by priority mail in the second wave of mailings Group 2 received two waves of first class mail followed by a priority mailing Group 3 received three first class mailings All three mailing methodologies yielded comparably high response rates so the authors dedicate most of their discussion to a comparison of tradeoffs between costs and fielding time Based on the findings it was

Alternate Contact Person Dave Edson SESTAT Surveys NSRCG NSCG SDR Abstract This paper examines the creation of generalized variance functions GVFs for each domain of interest in SESTAT This global approach produced well predicted variance estimates but could only provide standard errors for the combined SESTAT data set The researchers sought to improve on this model by combining three survey specific GVFs to form an integrated GVF This integrated GVF was used to predict standard errors for the component surveys and provided improved standard error prediction over the global model However since the global model provided GVFs of acceptable quality and was simpler to use it was adopted for SESTAT variance approximation http srsstats sbe nsf gov docs research 4 41 pdf 4 41 pdf Hicks Lloyd

probing affect whether the respondent provided a correct response and respondent requests for repetition and clarification The analysis also includes a special look at employment and education questions with less than 85 percent in the asked and answered only category The authors identify the general types of questions with higher than average rates for problem codes They also acknowledge that the positive results obtained during this study may be due in part to the fact that both the interviewers and the respondents knew the interview was being taped It is recommended that the study

Barbara Lepidus 1996 Reducing Mode Effects in Mark All That Apply Questions Published in Proceedings of the Section on Survey Research Methods Alexandria VA American Statistical Association Keywords Primacy effects recency effects mode effects question format Alternate Contact Person Dave Edson SESTAT Survey NSCG 93 Abstract This paper explores the extent to which mode effects in Mark All That Apply questions are reduced when such questions are reformatted to require a yes or no response after each response category The authors compare mail and telephone data from six questions that were rewritten using the yes no format to see if these revisions reduced or eliminated primacy effects on mail questionnaires and recency effects on telephone questionnaires They also examine the positioning of the questions within the surveys and performance measures used to evaluate the success of the yes no format in reducing mode effects The results show that the yes no format minimized primacy and recency effects but another mode effect emerged when the questions were administered by telephone there was an overall increase in the average number of yes responses The results also show that question position in the questionnaire and the number of response categories did not fully explain the modal differences in the total number or proportion of yes responses However when the authors used cognitive burden and an index combining position number of response categories and cognitive burden they found these measures to be positively correlated with larger differences by mode This suggests that reformatting may have had less of an effect on questions that were more difficult to answer 8 Research in Survey and Data Quality Coding Evaluations http srsstats sbe nsf gov docs

Alternate Contact Person Mary Collins SESTAT Survey NSRCG 95 Abstract This report discusses the best coding process used to evaluate the accuracy of respondent selected occupation codes during the 1995 National Survey of Recent College Graduates It includes an overview of the different CATI occupation coding methods that were used during survey administration and the occupational worksheet generated to examine the occupation code selected for each occupation reported The report also includes a comparison of changes made to self selected codes by coding method as well as a comparison of the time it took to code an occupation by coding method http srsstats sbe nsf gov docs research 8 41 pdf 8 41 pdf Hardy Linda P and Eisenhower Donna L 1994 Developing Methods for Collecting and Coding

data collection Alternate Contact Person Nirmala Kannankutty SESTAT Surveys NSRCG NSCG SDR Abstract This paper reviews traditional methods used to collect occupational data and research done on their applicability to the SESTAT population and collection It analyzes open ended and structured types of question formats and the types of errors associated with each It also explains the development of NSF s Best Coding process which attempts to mitigate the errors found in these data collection methods During best coding coders use all relevant data captured on the questionnaire to correct respondent errors NSF also developed occupational coding sheets coder reference materials and coder training procedures for use during the best coding process The end results of the redesign effort were to revise the open ended questions and occupation list Finally the paper discusses initial reports on the functioning of the new coding system and plans for further analysis http srsstats sbe nsf

coding accuracy error rates error factors problematic occupation codes self code agreement Alternate Contact Person Nirmala Kannankutty SESTAT Survey NSCG 95 Abstract This report provides an overview of the estimates tabulated from the NSCG 95 coding process Data for the evaluation were obtained from the Coding Quality Control operation This Quality Control QC process involved two production clerks double coding a fraction of the education and occupation responses obtained during the survey process The coders did not know whether they were assigning best codes or a QC code to an individual case The authors begin by estimating the index of reliability based on expected and observed agreements between the two coders and the ratio of disagreement to total cases coded The authors then examine the reliability of coding an occupation S E or non S E for major and minor groups The authors also examine the reliability of three digit codes and the error rates associated with the coding process They also identify problematic occupation codes Error factors providing a measure of how much a published estimate may have over or underestimated the proportion in a particular occupation category is also considered Finally the authors discuss estimates of self code related measures 9 General and Other SESTAT Research http srsstats sbe nsf gov docs research 9 31 pdf 9 31 pdf

American Statistical Association Keywords Quality profile SESTAT research and evaluation program Alternate Contact Person Nirmala Kannankutty SESTAT Surveys NSRCG NSCG SDR Abstract This paper focuses on the on going SESTAT research and evaluation program that was established in the early 1990 s It discusses the rationale behind having such a program and the main goals and features of the research and evaluation program The authors also review the factors considered when choosing SESTAT research and evaluation projects They highlight research activities that were conducted prior to the 1993 data collection and conducted concurrently with the 1993 data collection as well as future and continuing research and evaluation projects The authors also discuss how the results of the research and evaluation projects were used to improve future survey instruments and explore identified problems In conclusion the authors state that the NSF SESTAT program has benefited from the program of research and evaluation and that this program will continue in the future http srsstats sbe nsf gov docs research 9 41 pdf 9 41 pdf Shettle Carolyn 1992 What Happens When Your Surveys Need a Radical
