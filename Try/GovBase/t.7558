Page Message from the Director I am pleased to have been selected to serve as the Director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse NIDA and to have the opportunity to share with you my vision for the Institute over the next several years As a component of the National Institutes of Health NIDA has the critical role of supporting high quality research across a broad range of disciplines to reduce drug abuse and addiction and its related consequences NIDA also has the responsibility for ensuring that research findings are rapidly and effectively translated and disseminated to practitioners It is with the pursuit of fulfilling this dual mandate that I assume my new leadership role at NIDA It is an extraordinary time for science with discoveries occurring at unprecedented speed Breakthroughs in technology that were once in the realm of science fiction are allowing us to advance our understanding of the brain at an increasingly rapid pace Every day diseases that were previously little understood such as obesity diabetes mental illnesses and now addiction are being conquered by science Every advance that has been made from the most basic finding about genes receptors and reward circuitry to the development of new pharmacological and behavioral therapeutic interventions leads us to new questions that are starting to target the complex interactions between environmental social variables and genetic molecular processes in drug addiction NIDA will take full advantage of the explosion of knowledge that is occurring in the technology and biological research arena from the Human Genome Project to the use of neuroimaging and 3 dimensional brain mapping models to harness and use these tools and discoveries to bring the Nation even better prevention and treatment interventions We will focus on piecing together one of the most critical puzzles in almost every disease model the link between genes and the environment By determining the genetic and environmental factors that make some individuals more vulnerable to drugs of abuse than others we can develop new strategies for prevention early detection and treatment that are tailored to the needs of the individual Additionally NIDA will tap into what we ve come to learn from cognitive neuroscience to develop improved prevention and treatments models which is especially relevant as we look for ways to address vulnerable populations like children and adolescents and individuals who suffer from other illnesses By melding our understanding about drug craving and reward for example with our growing knowledge about behavioral and pharmacological approaches we will have new models to rethink how to best translate our basic knowledge of addiction into clinical progress As we continue to develop and test what I hope to be many new interventions we will look for both established and new ways to inform both clinical practice and public health with the latest science based findings and treatments We will collaborate with federal and private partners to harness resources and skills We will look to invigorate the medical profession to become more involved in drug abuse issues through clinical training efforts and by fostering new partnerships with physicians clinical specialists nurses psychiatrists psychologists sociologists and biotechnology pioneers among others to ensure the application of research knowledge into improved medical care I look forward to working with the research community the staff at NIDA the National Advisory Council on Drug Abuse other federal and local government agencies health professionals health services providers the private sector policy makers members of the public and constituent organizations to help shape NIDA s research agenda I also welcome the opportunity to work with the NIH Director Dr Elias Zerhouni and the other Institutes at NIH to pursue collaborative activities like the NIH Roadmap Project which I believe will systematically change how we do research I am also committed to ensuring that NIDA maintains the comprehensive research portfolio that is needed to deal with the many facets of the drug abuse and addiction problem including preventing new HIV infections and other blood borne diseases such as hepatitis C I know there will be many challenges along the way but with the support and guidance of those committed to this issue I will welcome and learn from them Sincerely Nora D Volkow M D Director 8830 times since 6 4 03 About NIDA Contents about welcome mission NIDA Movie1 html NIDA s Mission about welcome
