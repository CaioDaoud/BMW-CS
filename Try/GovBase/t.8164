OSEI Guagua Pichincha 1999 OPERATIONAL SIGNIFICANT EVENT IMAGERY Special Coverage Guagua Pichincha Guagua Pichincha Special Coverage Guagua Pichincha Special Coverage Background Guagua Pichincha is a stratovolcano which is located just 13 kilometers 8 miles west of Quito the capital of Ecuador The volcano had minor eruptions in 1981 1982 1997 and 1998 but the last major eruption occurred in 1660 when the city of Quito was blanketed with 30 centimeters 1 foot of ash On the afternoon of October 5 1999 Guagua Pichincha erupted sending large amounts of ash over and onto Quito The ash caused severe air quality problems and forced the closing of all commercial airports in and around the city Two days later the volcano erupted again this time in the morning OSEI provided full product coverage of both events including still images and movie loops of both eruptions Guagua Pichincha Volcano Eruption Special Coverage OSEI Products The Operational Significant Event Imagery support team created the following products which show the October 5 1999 eruption thumbnails below have been cropped from original image Guagua Pichincha Special Coverage Events Volcano Ecuador 1999 VSHguagua278 G8 jpg Guagua Pichincha Volcano Eruption Events Volcano Ecuador 1999 VSHguagua278 N4 jpg Guagua Pichincha Volcano Eruption Events Volcano Ecuador 1999 VSHguagua278 G8 avi Guagua Pichincha Volcano Eruption GOES 8 image of the initial ash cloud moments after the 10 5 99 eruption NOAA 15 image taken shortly after the eruption showing a comparison of the ash cloud in multispectral false color imagery and split window channel differenced imagery 10 frame GOES 8 AVI format movie showing the region from one hour prior to eruption through the eruption itself The movie encompasses 4 75 hours at half hour intervals from 17 15 through 21 45 UTC The OSEI team also produced three products showing the October 7 eruption Events Volcano Ecuador 1999 VSHguagua280 G8 jpg Guagua Pichincha Volcano Eruption Events Volcano Ecuador 1999 VSHguagua280 N5 jpg Guagua Pichincha Volcano Eruption Events Volcano Ecuador 1999 VSHguagua280 G8 avi Guagua Pichincha Volcano Eruption 5 panel GOES 8 image showing the progression of ash from the eruption NOAA 15 image taken shortly after the eruption showing a comparison of the ash cloud in multispectral false color imagery and split window channel differenced imagery 7 frame GOES 8 AVI format movie showing the region from a half hour prior to eruption through the eruption itself The movie encompasses 3 hours at half hour intervals from 11 45 through 14 45 UTC Volcano Links Events Volcano Other OSEI volcano products http www ssd noaa gov VAAC Volcano Ash Advisoy Center http www volcano si edu gvp world volcano cfm vnum 1502 02 Global Volcanism Program Guagua http www volcano si edu gvp Global Volcanism Program Main http www pgd hawaii edu Hawai i Institute of Geophysics and Planetology
