volunteers contribute thousands of hours each year to help HVO s staff monitor the active volcanoes of Hawai i and conduct research on various aspects of Hawaiian volcanism The volunteers in turn gain experience working on active volcanoes and participating in scientific research collecting and analyzing data building and installing instruments for experiments and volcano and earthquake monitoring taking photographs and conducting surveys and working on team or individual research projects http hvo wr usgs gov volunteer 19991118 CH 180380 large jpg Volunteers help install a tiltmeter into a

Hawai i s active volcanoes and natural beauty make the volunteer positions very popular and highly competitive HVO provides free lodging for as many as 7 volunteers at a time in a fully furnished house about 4 km from the Observatory Volunteers staying in our guest house must be willing to work for at least three months on a full time basis Transportation is provided between the house and HVO

the field sometimes in remote areas of Hawai i Volcanoes National Park and other parts of the Big Island For these positions volunteers often must hike several kilometers over rough and irregular ground in hot humid conditions or sometimes in raw bone chilling cold and wet weather high on the volcanoes Also some of the field sites are near active fumaroles and many sites are intermittently swept by the plume of sulfur dioxide gas from the Pu u O o vent the noxious plume poses a health hazard by aggravating preexisting respiratory ailments for more information about the plume see http
