component of the http www fgdc gov clearinghouse clearinghouse html National Spatial Data Infrastructure NSDI It provides a pathway to find information about geospatial or spatially referenced data available from USGS The USGS node actually encompasses a distributed set of sites organized on the basis of the USGS s four principal data themes The first Geography offers the familiar USGS topographic maps and other geographic products that have long been associated with USGS These products typically are of general use across many disciplines for basemaps and other purposes As Geographic Information Systems have come to play an increasingly important role in science however the biology geology and water disciplines also have produced important geographic data sets related to their themes These thematic products are best found by discipline Discipline Resources Available http mapping usgs gov Geography Here you will find links to the National Map topographic maps orthophoto quadrangles geographic names satellite imagery and photo archives and many other mapping products in digital and paper forms http www nbii gov Biology The National Biological Information Infrastructure NBII links diverse high quality biological databases information products and analytical tools maintained by NBII partners and other contributors in government agencies academic

other data sets on topics such as aquifer characteristics evapotransporation climate and agricultural chemical usage Searching for Data You can also search for data sets using the http clearinghouse1 fgdc gov FGDC Clearinghouse The clearinghouse lists more than 260 nodes serving spatial metadata The FGDC search allows you to query all nodes or to limit your search to particular nodes The principal

set you want we strongly recommend that you examine the http www fgdc gov publications documents metadata metabroc html metadata files associated with the data set The metadata often provides important information for using the data set Some data sets are available online at no cost For others you may need to set up an account to pay a distribution fee Some data sets are not online and you will be instructed how to order a compact disk or a tape USGS data sets also are available through many http rockyweb cr usgs gov acis bin querypartner cgi business partners Viewing Data Many data sets now are viewable through http mapping usgs gov partners viewonline html on line applications USGS digital data products are designed to be read and used by geographic information systems GIS image processing systems or similar computer applications If you are not using one of the on line applications then you will need to obtain appropriate software from commercial or other sources in order to use any geospatial data that you purchase or download from the USGS More information about geographic information systems can be obtained from the http www ncgia ucsb edu pubs publications
