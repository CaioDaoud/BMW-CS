that a There is a national interest in the effective management beneficial use protection and development of the coastal zone b The coastal zone is rich in a variety of natural commercial recreational ecological industrial and esthetic resources of immediate and potential value to the present and future well being of the Nation c The increasing and competing demands upon the lands and waters of our coastal zone occasioned by population growth and economic development including requirements for industry commerce residential development recreation extraction of mineral resources and fossil fuels transportation and navigation waste disposal and harvesting of fish shellfish and other living marine resources have resulted in the loss of living marine resources wildlife nutrient rich areas permanent and adverse changes to ecological systems decreasing open space for public use and shoreline erosion d The habitat areas of the coastal zone and the fish shellfish other living marine resources and wildlife therein are ecologically fragile and consequently extremely vulnerable to destruction by man s alterations e Important ecological cultural historic and esthetic values in the coastal zone which are essential to the well being of all citizens are being irretrievably damaged or lost f New and expanding demands for food energy minerals defense needs recreation waste disposal transportation and industrial activities in the Great Lakes territorial sea exclusive economic zone and Outer Continental Shelf are placing stress on these areas and are creating the need for resolution of serious conflicts among important and competing uses and values in coastal and ocean waters g Special natural and scenic characteristics are being damaged by ill planned development that threatens these values h In light of competing demands and the urgent need to protect and to give high priority to natural systems in the coastal zone present state and local institutional arrangements for planning and regulating land and water uses in such areas are inadequate i The key to more effective protection and use of the land and water resources of the coastal zone is to encourage the states to exercise their full authority over the lands and waters in the coastal zone by assisting the states in cooperation with Federal and local governments and other vitally affected interests in developing land and water use programs for the coastal zone including unified policies criteria standards methods and processes for dealing with land and water use decisions of more than local significance j The national objective of attaining a greater degree of energy self sufficiency would be advanced by providing Federal financial assistance to meet state and local needs resulting from new or expanded energy activity in or affecting the coastal zone k Land uses in the coastal zone and the uses of adjacent lands which drain into the coastal zone may significantly affect the quality of coastal waters and habitats and efforts to control coastal water pollution from land use activities must be improved l Because global warming may result in a substantial sea level rise with serious adverse effects in the coastal zone coastal states must anticipate and plan for such an occurrence m Because of their proximity to and reliance upon the ocean and its resources the coastal states have substantial and significant interests in the protection management and development of the resources of the exclusive economic zone that can only be served by the active participation of coastal states in all Federal programs affecting such resources and wherever appropriate by the development of state ocean resource plans as part of their federally approved coastal zone management programs 1452 Congressional declaration of policy Section 303 The Congress finds and declares that it is the national policy 1 to preserve protect develop and where possible to restore or enhance the resources of the Nation s coastal zone for this and succeeding generations 2 to encourage and assist the states to exercise effectively their responsibilities in the coastal zone through the development and implementation of management programs to achieve wise use of the land and water resources of the coastal zone giving full consideration to ecological cultural historic and esthetic values as well as the needs for compatible economic development which programs should at least provide for A the protection of natural resources including wetlands floodplains estuaries beaches dunes barrier islands coral reefs and fish and wildlife and their habitat within the coastal zone B the management of coastal development to minimize the loss of life and property caused by improper development in flood prone storm surge geological hazard and erosion prone areas and in areas likely to be affected by or vulnerable to sea level rise land subsidence and saltwater intrusion and by the destruction of natural protective features such as beaches dunes wetlands and barrier islands C the management of coastal development to improve safeguard and restore the quality of coastal waters and to protect natural resources and existing uses of those waters D priority consideration being given to coastal dependent uses and orderly processes for siting major facilities related to national defense energy fisheries development recreation ports and transportation and the location to the maximum extent practicable of new commercial and industrial developments in or adjacent to areas where such development already exists E public access to the coasts for recreation purposes F assistance in the redevelopment of deteriorating urban waterfronts and ports and sensitive preservation and restoration of historic cultural and esthetic coastal features G the coordination and simplification of procedures in order to ensure expedited governmental decisionmaking for the management of coastal resources H continued consultation and coordination with and the giving of adequate consideration to the views of affected Federal agencies I the giving of timely and effective notification of and opportunities for public and local government participation in coastal management decisionmaking J assistance to support comprehensive planning conservation and management for living marine resources including planning for the siting of pollution control and aquaculture facilities within the coastal zone and improved coordination between State and Federal coastal zone management agencies and State and wildlife agencies and K the study and development in any case in which the Secretary considers it to be appropriate of plans for addressing the adverse effects upon the coastal zone of land subsidence and of sea level rise and 3 to encourage the preparation of special area management plans which provide for increased specificity in protecting significant natural resources reasonable coastal dependent economic growth improved protection of life and property in hazardous areas including those areas likely to be affected by land subsidence sea level rise or fluctuating water levels of the Great Lakes and improved predictability in governmental decisionmaking 4 to encourage the participation and cooperation of the public state and local governments and interstate and other regional agencies as well as of the Federal agencies having programs affecting the coastal zone in carrying out the purposes of this title 5 to encourage coordination and cooperation with and among the appropriate Federal State and local agencies and international organizations where appropriate in collection analysis synthesis and dissemination of coastal management information research results and technical assistance to support State and Federal regulation of land use practices affecting the coastal and ocean resources of the United States and 6 to respond to changing circumstances
