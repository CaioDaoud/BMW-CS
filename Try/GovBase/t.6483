conducts pinniped and seabird research in Arctic sub Arctic and Antarctic marine ecosystems The underlying objectives of this research are to determine what factors are primarily responsible for influencing the population dynamics of polar pinnipeds Current studies focus on feeding ecology reproductive success growth and condition demography abundance prey availability and environmental conditions Sub Arctic research is focused on harborseals htm Alaska harbor seals throughout their entire geographic range Research on arctic htm Arctic ice seals ringed bearded spotted and ribbon seals include surveys behavioral studies utilizing satellite linked transmitters and monitoring of subsistence harvests by Alaska Natives Studies of Antarticecosys htm Antarctic ecosystems have been under way for more than a decade but have shifted from fur seal and seabird investigations to work more focused on ice seals which provides valuable ecological comparisons with Arctic ice seal studies These research projects are designed to detect significant changes in pinniped status and trends and the ecosystems of which they are a part and to distinguish between changes due to commercial fisheries and those due to natural causes The three principal research areas within the Polar Ecosystems Program are harborseals htm Alaska harbor seals arctic htm Arctic ice seals Antarticecosys htm
