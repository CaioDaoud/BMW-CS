Summary Website Last updated 4 8 03 Purpose This web page has been put together to help potential cgi LAPB homepage cgi LAPS users and provide consistent information with regard to LAPS frequently asked questions FAQs Most of this information is already available via the web through our frd laps software README html README file However due to the increasing number if inquiries with regard to LAPS details a webpage that focused on the FAQs from interested users was deemed appropriate As inquiries are fielded by our LAPS staff we intend to update this page as often as needed This page also contains valuable links to a number of information sources that will help answer LAPS related questions Topical index System 20Requirements System Requirements Data 20Specific 20Information Data

Disclaimer Disclaimer Inquiries Inquiries LAPS System Requirements What are typical disk space requirements for input data and generated output The current Colorado and AWIPS LAPS domain size 61x61x21 Typically generates approximately 380 400 Mbytes of data per 24 hours We purge LAPS hourly retaining in most cases 24 hours worth of information Some files are maintained longer i e LAPS soil moisture lsm files are kept for 48 hours This requirement scales upward or downward depending on domain size A typical file one time s output for one 3 d field consumes 316892 bytes How much machine memory does LAPS need The current version of LAPS requires approximately 256 Mbytes of RAM primarily for its satellite interface If you don t run LAPS with satellite data less than 128 Mbytes of RAM are required We are working on a future release that will enable it to run with satellite data and require less than 128 Mbytes of RAM Data specific information What data formats are used in LAPS http www unidata ucar edu packages netcdf index html NetCDF or ASCII data are used for output and most internal data storage This way all data files are machine independent How does LAPS interface to my local datasets Each local installation requires unique routines to access local data These local routines are the responsibility of the user and are linked and become part of the LAPS ingest software What satellite data does LAPS use Currently LAPS uses GOES image data visible plus IR channels 3 4 and 5 and GOES sounder channels The current satellite for which an interface exists using the OPTRAN forward model is GOES 8 now off line GOES 9 now serving W Pacific GOES 10 Current US western satellite GOES 12 As of April 1 the US eastern satellite Currently GOES 12 support is under construction Bosnia prototype What are the data sets used in the Bosnia demonstration The following datasets are used in the Bosnia prototype at AFGWC RAOBs Surface data SAOs NOGAPS forecasts background Platforms What platforms has LAPS run on To date LAPS has run on Sun SunOS v 4 3 1 Solaris is planned later this year IBM AIX v 2 3 AFGWC has this running under AIX v 4 but we have not yet tested this at FSL HP HP UX v B 10 20 DEC VAX VMS original version no longer supported LINUX 6 2 and higher PGF90 compiler only We plan to port to SGI IRIX64 v 6 2 Dec Alpha OSF1 v 4 0 How much computer time is needed to run LAPS On our Sun 670 SunOS v 4 3 1 one LAPS cycle for the Colorado 61x61x21 domain takes roughly 10 15 minutes 9 5min Avg 7 294x10 3 sec gridpoint On our IBM 590 AIX v 2 3 one ROC domain cycle 125x105x21 takes between 6 16 minutes 9 3min Avg 2 024x10 3 sec gridpoint Misc How many lines of code does LAPS contain LAPS contains approximately 180 000 lines of FORTRAN and 34 000 lines of C code There are additional lines for scripts Make files and the like but this give you a rough estimate This figure does not include any model code e g RAMS or MM5 this is strictly analysis code Is LAPS Y2K Compliant The latest information on this is can be found on our y2k laps 2000 html Y2K page What is newLAPS During 1997 LAPS was recast into a more user friendly configuration format This new system comes with an auto configure feature that will examine your system to see what operating system you have what compiler settings are required where special libraries exist and if they don t it will let you know to get them before you proceed and then it allows you to specify directory paths for different aspects of the system Data binaries and source code can be separated to different user defined paths The makefiles are automatically configured for your system and the system builds NewLAPS also contains better terrain data than Old LAPS 30 second for the entire globe What software is used to visualize LAPS IDL is now used for most web graphics A plotting program using NCAR graphics is supplied with LAPS and is also used for some web graphics What are the critical datasets for LAPS Basically you need Background data generally forecasts from a large scale forecast model mandatory for upper level output LAPS has used the following forecast models to supply background information RUC ETA AVN NOGAPS Surface data mandatory for most upper level output What happens if data sets fail to arrive in time for inclusion in a given analysis run LAPS is robust However given less data the analysis will be less and less accurate It will run until the surface or background fields are not available Does LAPS use 3D Var three dimensional variational analysis techniques Not at this time However some aspects of LAPS utilize 1D var surface temperature gradients from satellite data upper level humidity adjustment from satellite data complete with forward model We are pursuing an upgrade to 3Dvar and this is one of our current interests What does Hot Start mean Hot start is a jargon term that basically means the diabatic initialization of the model is achieved within the initial conditions provided by LAPS to a model Thus the model has no inherent spin up when it begins since the mass fields are all in balance guaranteed by the LAPS balance modules What are the characteristics of the terrain data that LAPS comes with OldLAPS terrain file covers the entire globe with 30 second resolution over most of the continental United States 10 minute resolution of the rest of the world NewLAPS terrain covers the entire globe 30 second resolution full coverage even Antarctica Additional information More information can be found under our readme file frd laps
