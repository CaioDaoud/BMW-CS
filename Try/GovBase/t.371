encompasses over 5000 square miles stretching along 300 miles of coastline from Marin County in the north to San Luis Obispo County in the south This proximity to the coastline makes the Sanctuary vulnerable to pollution problems in the watersheds html watershed areas that drain to it including contaminants such as sediments nutrients fecal bacteria pesticides oil grease metals and detergents Recognizing that water quality is key to ensuring protection for all Sanctuary resources a Memorandum of Agreement was signed in 1992 by eight federal state and local agencies agreeing to work together to develop a Water Quality Protection Program WQPP for the Sanctuary Today the WQPP is a partnership of comm html 25 federal state and local agencies public and private groups dedicated to protecting and enhancing water quality in the Sanctuary and its watersheds Using a collaborative approach involving key stakeholders in each issue four detailed plans have been completed To learn more about the recommendations and how we and our partners are implementing each of the four plans urban html urban runoff Urban Runoff marinas html marina Marinas and Boating monitoring html monitoring

harbormasters and environmental organizations on the siting of pumpout facilities for oily bilgewater in local harbors technical trainings for harbor staff and educational outreach to boaters The largest and most recent plan addresses polluted runoff from over 4000 square miles of ag html agriculture and rural lands It includes a unique agreement with the Farm Bureaus representing the region s extensive agricultural community to establish industry led networks to improve soil nitrate and pesticide management practices Initial implementation of this plan has included establishment of farmer led erosion and nitrate control projects in five watersheds The effort has also generated substantial additional funding from the USDA to our partners the Natural Resources Conservation Service the University of California Cooperative Extension and local Resource Conservation Districts to bring on a team of experts to help carry out the plan and conduct technical outreach to farmers on conservation measures Public outreach and education is a key factor in the success of the WQPP Various wqnewsletter html water quality education materials and programs have been developed including posters brochures watershed models and displays teacher training workshops slide presentations and videos The WQPP is continuing to focus on expanding implementation of all the plans with its partners
