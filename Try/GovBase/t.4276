Commerce for Intellectual Property and Director of the U S Patent and Trademark Office USPTO has announced that he intends to leave his post on January 9 2004 Under Rogan s direction the USPTO has improved in every aspect of its operations Early in his tenure Rogan who has headed the agency since December 2001 launched a five year 21st Century Strategic Plan that is revolutionizing the U S patent and trademark systems The House Commerce State Justice and Judiciary Appropriations Subcommittee report for USPTO s 2004 budget notes that this plan calls for some of the most sweeping changes to the patent review process in 200 years and the committee supports these recommendations During his two short years at the helm of the USPTO Rogan changed the culture of the agency by making quality

examiners and managers as well patent attorneys and agents have the requisite knowledge skills and abilities to produce top quality examination results Rogan also established a comprehensive quality assurance program for patents and trademarks that mandates quality reviews throughout the examination process main homepagenews bak09dec2003 htm Read more http www uspto gov main newsandnotices htm
