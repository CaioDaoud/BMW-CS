March 19 2003 Major goals of the Building and Fire Research Laboratory BFRL are to improve the productivity of the U S construction industry which now faces stiff competition from overseas firms and to reduce the human and economic losses resulting from fires earthquakes winds and other hazards Through performance prediction and measurement technologies as well as technical advances the laboratory works to improve the life cycle quality of constructed facilities Its products are used by those who own design construct supply and provide for the safety or environmental quality of constructed facilities additives air conditioning air handling unit algorithms alternative refrigerants average cost pricing BACnet beams benefit cost analysis binary mixtures Boiteux model bridges
