Diversity In Law Firms main css The U S Equal Employment Opportunity Commission Diversity In Law Firms U S Equal Employment Opportunity Commission 2003 Executive Summary Since 1975 the representation of women African Americans Hispanics and Asian Americans as professionals in larger Legal Service firms has increased substantially Women increased from 14 4 percent in 1975 to 40 3 percent in 2002 African Americans from 2 3 percent to 4 4 percent Hispanics from 0 7 percent to 2 9 percent Asians from 0 5 percent to 5 3 percent There were parallel increases in J D degrees from 1982 to 2002 Women receiving law degrees increased from 33 percent in 1982 to 48 3 in 2002 African Americans from 4 2 percent to 7 2 percent Hispanics from 2 3 percent to 5 7 percent Asians from 1 3 percent to 6 5 percent Firm characteristics such as size number of offices locations prestige and earnings rankings appear to have more effect on the proportion of minority legal professionals than the proportion of women legal professionals However both the proportion of women and the proportion of minorities are significantly higher in firms with more offices Minority legal professionals are likely to be associated with firms in the top ten legal markets cities and in firms ranked in the top 100 on the basis of prestige and or earnings Large nationally known law firms generally have a higher proportion of women and minorities than other types of law firms There is also less variation in the proportion of women and minorities among these large nationally known law firms In comparing associates and partners in a sample of large law firms women African Americans Hispanics and Asians all have lower odds of being partners than White males Table of Contents intro Introduction changes

Methodological Appendix Comparison of EEO 1 and NALP Surveys Methodological Appendix ref Selected References Introduction Purpose The purpose of this report is to examine the employment status of women and minorities at law firms required to file EEO 1 reports An employer is required to file an EEO 1 report if it employs 100 or more employees Therefore this study covers law firms which would be characterized as medium to large Specifically it examines employment status in a general sense to display the changes in the employment of minorities and women as attorneys since 1975 It also looks at the organizational characteristics of firms to explore the variations in the current employment of minorities and women Finally a major issue in law firms the prospect of becoming a partner is examined empirically to determine the relative likelihood of women and minorities being partners The Legal Profession The importance of the legal profession in today s society is unquestionable Lawyers are often powerful players in social economic and political circles and as women and minorities become an increasing part of this profession their ability to obtain public and private influence is increasing 1 L awyers are very often key players in designing and activating the institutional mechanisms through which property is transferred economic exchange is planned and enforced injuries are compensated crime is punished marriages are dissolved and disputes are resolved The ideologies and incentives of the lawyers engaged in these functions directly influence the lived experience of Americans including whether they feel fairly treated by legal institutions p 346 2 However perhaps more important than the influence of attorneys is the central role they play in maintaining social stability The persuasive power of law as a tool to change or eliminate certain or nonproductive behavior must in part be attributable to the respect and acquiescence afforded to the law and lawyers by those subject to it Hence the development of law and its practice as a noble profession rather than as a trade or occupation p 1022 3 More specifically Patterns of stratification with the legal profession are important in their own right but they are of particular concern to legal scholars and legal educators because principles of inequality among lawyers may suggest much about whether access to justice in our society is fairly distributed If race gender and social class are determinants for entry into the profession and for the attainment of certain positions within the profession it may imply that these same attributes affect the sorts of treatment individuals will receive by legal institutions in part because they do not have access to lawyers who share a similar social background Nelson 1988 p 368 4 Social scientists have researched many aspects of American law firms including size geographic location hiring and promotion patterns legal specialties profitability and client characteristics Several themes emerge from this literature Public Sector Employment Many studies find that women and minorities are likely to hold jobs in the public sector For example Payne and Nelson 2003 in a study of the Chicago bar as of 1995 report that 20 7 percent of white women lawyers were employed by government or the judiciary compared to 7 6 percent of white men The percentages for African American lawyers and Hispanic lawyers in government and the judiciary are even higher 43 8 percent and 37 5 percent respectively See their Table 2 2 5 Private Sector Employment Almost all studies find a substantial increase in the employment of women and minorities in private sector law firms For example in a study of ninety seven elite law firms in Chicago Los Angles New York and Washington Elizabeth Chambliss 1997 states that the lawyers who work in elite law firms historically have been white Protestant men who graduated from prestigious law schools such as Harvard Columbia and Yale As recently as 1970 women and people of color were almost completely excluded Since 1970 the gender and race composition of elite law firms has changed considerably at the associate level By 1980 23 2 of the associates in the sample were women by 1990 36 2 of associates in the sample were women Although the level of racial diversity is much lower it too has increased By 1980 3 6 of associates in the sample were minorities by 1990 6 5 of associates were minorities pp 695 696 6 Information on Minorities As a general rule the available literature tends to focus more on women than minorities in the legal profession 7 Increasing Focus on Mechanisms Although many of earlier studies concentrated on broad questions about the distribution of women and minorities across different sectors of the legal profession recent studies are increasingly examining employment practices in large private law firms Examples follow Attrition8 The 2003 NALP Foundation Study of entry level hiring and attrition9 concluded that Compared to men as a whole male minority associates were more likely to have departed their employers within 28 months 29 6 percent vs 21 6 of men overall and were far more likely to have departed within 55 months of their start date 68 percent minority males departed vs 52 3 percent of men overall Female minority associates departed their law firm employers at somewhat greater rates than women as a whole with the differential widening as the years in the job increased Nearly two thirds 64 4 percent of female minority associates had departed their employers within 55 months compared to just over half 54 9 percent of women overall p 23 10 Earnings An examination of pay differences among University of Michigan Law School graduates by Noonan Corcoran and Courant 2003 compared male female differences in earnings 15 years after graduation for two cohorts 1 men and women who graduated from law school between 1972 and 1978 and 2 men and women who graduated from law school between 1979 and 1985 We find that the gender gap in earnings has remained relatively constant 15 years after graduation women in both cohorts earn approximately 60 of men s earnings Penalties to part time work and career interruptions11 also remain steady While within occupation sex segregation has declined over time sex differences in hours worked have increased and assume a more prominent role in explaining the sex gap in lawyers earnings p 1 12 Promotion A study of eight large New York corporate law firms describes the traditional up and out system of promotions to partner as follows Women have fared poorly under the up and out system Using data supplied by the firms and the Martindale Hubbell Law Directory we tracked cohorts of first year associates in the eight firms in periods beginning in 1973 74 and 1985 86 for a ten year period to see how many associates had been elevated to partner The last cohort those hired in 1985 86 were followed until 1994 For each cohort except the first where one quarter of women associates five of twenty made partner men associates gained partnership at a higher rate than women For the entire period 19 362 of 1878 of men attainted partnership while only 8 60 of 754 of women made partner p 358 13 Research Methodologies Most studies of legal employment have relied on public data sources or individual interviews with attorneys With several notable exceptions e g the continuing studies of the Chicago bar14 there have been relatively few systematic large scale sampling studies of American lawyers Perhaps the most promising future development is the work currently being done by the After the JD AJD study One of the strengths of the AJD study is the broad range of organizations supporting the project In addition to the National Science Foundation the AJD project obtained funding from a number of organizations interested in legal education and the profession including Access Group American Bar Foundation Law School Admission Council NALP and NALP Foundation National Conference of Bar Examiners and the Open Society Institute The AJD project is based on a two stage scientific sampling design that first selects among geographic areas and then selects individual attorneys within those areas The sample population consists of persons who first became members of a state bar in calendar year 2000 and who graduated from law school in the period July 1 1998 through June 30 2000 Approximately 9200 individuals received an initial questionnaire sent in March 2002 and a sample of these about 20 are currently being interviewed face to face Respondents will be re contacted five and ten years after their admission to the bar The forthcoming results of the AJD project will provide a rich and unparalleled source of data on attorney careers including first job after law school and all subsequent jobs as well as detailed descriptions of the current job such as partnership status hours worked and time devoted to different legal specialties The next section will examine trends in the legal profession over time Various data sources are considered The Current Population Survey covers attorneys data from the American Bar Association covers prospective attorneys as reflected in law degrees conferred and the EEO 1 covers a range of legal professionals that are predominately attorneys but other job titles such as non lawyer accountants as well Despite the diversity of data sources most of the trends suggest a uniform pattern of increased growth in the participation of women and minorities in the American legal profession Changes in the Employment of Women and Minorities Three different data sources are used to examine how the employment of women and minorities in the legal professional has changed over time These three data sets provide different perspectives on the employment of attorneys The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission s EEOC s own EEO 1 report is used to reflect employment in large private law firms Private employers with 100 or more employees are required to file annual EEO 1 reports with EEOC They are also required to file separate reports for each of their establishments with 50 or more employees By and large when companies in the Legal Services industry file such reports the professional job group provides a fairly representative index of diversity among associate attorneys 15 Due to the filing threshold of 100 employees the EEO 1 data best captures the employment practices of large private firms Of course not all lawyers are employed by these types of organizations Therefore a second data set the Current Population Survey16 was used to obtain a perspective on the more general labor market for attorneys Finally to obtain a sense of the availability of women and minority attorneys data on law degrees J D degrees conferred is examined 17 Two different time periods are examined For EEO 1 data it is possible to construct a relatively long time period from 1975 to 2002 Due to the limitations of the other data sets the period from 1982 to 2002 is examined when using all three types of data FIGURE 1 EMPLOYMENT OF WOMEN EEO 1 1975 2002 YEAR 1975 1982 1987 1992 1997 2002 WOMEN PERCENT 14 4 32 6 35 9 37 38 1 40 3 Women In 1975 women represented just 14 4 percent of all professionals in the legal services industry based on their filing of EEO 1 reports By 2002 this figure increases dramatically to 40 3 percent See Figure 1 It is interesting to compare these results to the percent of women receiving law degrees and the percent of women lawyers in the entire workforce as reflected in the Current Population Survey See Figure 2 Figure 2 Comparisons of Degrees Conferred EEO 1 Employment and Current Population Survey Data for Women 1982 1987 1992 1997 2002 LEGAL PROFESSIONALS EEO1 32 6 35 9 37 38 1 40 3 LAWYERS CPS 13 8 19 6 21 4 26 6 29 2 JD DEGREES 33 40 42 7 43 8 48 3 In 1982 the percent of women reported as professionals in Legal Services on the EEO 1 is nearly identical to the percent of women receiving law degrees in that year However by 2002 the employment of women as professionals in these larger law firms is eight percentage points below degrees conferred Employment of women lawyers reported in the Current Population Survey falls behind both the employment of women professionals in legal services as reported on the EEO 1 and law degrees obtained by women Rates of change were computed for women over this time period in order to obtain a better sense of the relative differences over time Because the raw numbers in the three data sources differ in magnitude the percentages are used to compute these rates The percent of women professionals in legal services on the EEO 1 increased by 23 6 percent during the period while the rate of change for J D degrees conferred was 46 4 percent CPS employment of women attorneys exhibit a rate of change of 112 percent over the period This suggests the employment of women in the larger law firms required to file EEO 1 reports may not have kept pace with law degrees obtained by women or the employment of women attorneys in the general work force Despite this the employment of women in these firms remained higher than in the more general work force Minorities African Americans represented 2 3 percent of these employees in 1975 and 4 4 percent in 2002 However the percent of Asian professionals in Legal Services reported on the EEO 1 exceeds African American professionals by 2002 Starting at just 0 5 percent in 1975 Asians represent 5 3 percent in 2002 Hispanics increased from 0 7 percent to just less than 3 percent Native American Alaskan Natives are poorly represented among these workers See Figure 3 Figure 3 EEO 1 Employment by Race Ethnicity 1975 2002 YEAR 1975 1982 1987 1992 1997 2002 ASIAN PERCENT 0 5 1 2 1 5 2 4 3 6 5 3 AFRICAN AMERICAN PERCENT 2 3 2 9 2 8 3 1 3 9 4 4 HISPANIC PERCENT 0 7 1 1 1 2 1 7 2 3 2 9 NATIVE AMERICAN PERCENT 0 0 0 2 0 1 0 1 0 2 African Americans As Figure 4 shows law degrees earned by African Americans appear to consistently exceed the employment of African Americans as professionals in Legal Services in large private law firms EEO 1 data and as lawyers in the general work force CPS data Figure 4 Comparisons of Degrees Conferred EEO 1 Employment and Current Population Survey Data for African Americans YEAR 1982 1987 1992 1997 2002 LEGAL PROFESSIONALS EEO1 2 9 2 8 3 1 3 9 4 4 LAWYERS CPS 2 7 3 2 7 2 7 4 6 JD DEGREES 4 2 4 6 5 2 7 7 2 Further unlike the employment patterns for women the proportion of African Americans employed as lawyers in the general labor market and as professionals in law firms as captured by the EEO 1 data is fairly consistent However there is a slight difference in the manner in which these rates have changed over time At the beginning of the period African Americans make up 2 9 percent of professional employment in the EEO 1 reports filed by Legal Service firms and climb to 4 4 percent in 2002 In the general work force figures captured by the CPS African Americans start lower in 1982 at 2 7 percent and at the end of the period reaches 4 6 percent which slightly exceeds the EEO 1 figure Rates of change based on these percentages reflect the same dynamics but produce much larger disparities in rates of change From 1982 to 2002 the African American percentage of EEO 1 reported professionals in legal services increased 51 7 percent and employment of African American attorneys in the general work force increased at a rate of 70 4 percent The increase in EEO 1 employment of African Americans as professionals in Legal Services did not keep pace with the change in law degrees earned by African Americans a rate of change of 71 4 percent but the CPS based rate of change and degrees conferred is similar Thus changes in the employment of African American professionals in private sector firms required to file EEO 1 reports lagged behind their increase as lawyers in the general work force and in their increased rate of receiving law degrees over the past twenty years Hispanics In 1982 Hispanics were earning law degrees at a rate 2 3 percent exceeding their representation as professionals in Legal Services and as attorneys in the general work force By the end of the period this disparity continues However the more interesting change for Hispanics over the last twenty years is their slow but steady growth in the large law firms required to file EEO 1 reports Although still a relatively small portion of professionals at 2 9 percent the rate of change over the period was high at 163 percent This exceeded their growth in obtaining degrees 148 percent and was much larger than their growth as attorneys in the general work force of 72 percent See Figure 5 Figure 5 Comparisons of Degrees Conferred EEO 1 Employment and Current Population Survey Data for Hispanics YEAR 1982

2002 the percentage of Asian professionals in Legal Services 5 3 percent as reported on the EEO 1 exceeds the percentage of African Americans 4 4 percent Current Population Survey data on the general work force is not available for Asians Degrees conferred to Asians also increases during the twenty year study period In 1982 just 1 3 percent of all law degrees are awarded to Asians but by 2002 they earn 6 5 percent of all degrees See Figure 6 Figure 6 Comparisons of Degrees Conferred and EEO 1 Employment Data for Asians YEAR 1982 1987 1992 1997 2002 LEGAL PROFESSIONALS EEO1 1 2 1 5 2 4 3 6 5 3 JD DEGREES 1 3 1 8 3 2 5 9 6 5 Over the past twenty years the rate of change for the percent of Asians reported as professional by Legal Service firms on their EEO 1 reports is 341 percent The increase in law degrees earned by Asians is even higher at 400 percent Native Americans Over the past twenty years the proportion of Native Americans receiving law degrees and reported as professionals by Legal Service firms on their EEO 1 report has increased but still remains less than one percent By 2002 Native American represented 0 2 percent of the relevant professional work force and 0 7 percent of law degrees conferred Summary Since 1975 the representation of women African Americans Hispanics and Asian Americans as professionals in the larger Legal Service firms that are required to file EEO 1 reports has increased substantially Even greater has been the increase in law degrees earned by minorities Paralleling the finding regarding increased employment among large law firms are increases in the employment of these groups as attorneys in the general work force Law Firm Organizational Characteristics This section examines some issues related to firm size and geographic location that can be studied with the 2002 EEO 1 data on professionals in private legal service firms The basic research problem can be posed as follows There has been a substantial increase in the size of law firms over the last thirty years As summarized by Chiu and Leicht 1999 Law firms grew dramatically in size and number In the early 1960s there were 38 firms with 50 or more lawyers In 1991 there were 751 firms with more than 50 lawyers and 13 of all lawyers were employed in firms with at least 50 lawyers up from 5 in 1980 p 569 18 Given this growth in the demand for new lawyers and the increased number of women and minorities graduated from law schools many observers predicted that larger law firms should have a higher proportion of women and minorities than smaller and medium sized law firms Yet the empirical results are somewhat mixed Among lawyers in private practice the Payne and Nelson study 2003 Table 2 2 of the Chicago bar in 1995 finds a higher percentage of white women attorneys than African American attorneys working for firms with 100 or more lawyers 44 9 percent and 28 0 percent respectively 19 For the 1990s cohort of Michigan Law School graduates Lempert Chambers and Adams 2000 Tables 11 and 14 find significant differences in the proportion of white and minority alumni taking first jobs in firms with 151 or more lawyers 55 9 percent and 35 7 percent respectively but no significant differences between white and minority alumni in holding current jobs in firms with 151 or more lawyers 37 9 percent and 31 0 percent respectively Chiu and Leicht 1999 p 569 report that in Chiu s 1996 analysis of the 1990 National Survey of Lawyers Career Satisfaction women were more likely to work in large law firms than men but this difference was not statistically significant once years since graduation was controlled The Chambliss study of elite law firms 1997 Tables 11a and 11b finds a statistically significant negative relationship between firm size the proportion of female partners but no statistically significant relationship between firm size and the proportion of female associates The 2002 NALP summary data on Women and Attorneys of Color at Law Firms20 suggests that law firm size is more strongly related to the percentage of minority associates than the percentage of women associates The overall percentage of minority associates in the 2002 NALP survey is 14 3 percent which varies from 10 1 percent in law firms with less then 100 attorneys to 16 9 percent in law firms with 501 or more attorneys The overall percentage of women associates is 42 4 percent which varies from 40 6 percent in firms with less than 100 attorneys to 43 4 percent in firms with 251 to 500 attorneys These relationships are examined in greater detail using the 2002 EEO 1 data 21 The following organizational characteristics of law firms are likely to be important factors and are used in this analysis Total Number of Offices Per Law Firm in the 2002 EEO 1 Survey Total Employment of EEO 1 Legal Professionals in All Offices22 Geographic dispersion as measured by the Total Number of U S Census Divisions where the the Firm has Offices23 Firm Cited in Top 100 Ranking of Law Firms by Either Prestige or Partner Profits24 Proportion of Total Legal Professions in the Top Ten Legal Markets25 Presence of at Least One Firm Office in a U S Southern State26 The first three explanatory variables number of law offices per firm total number of legal professionals and total number of census divisions covered by the firm are highly interrelated 27 To simplify the analysis we treated the number of offices per firm as a surrogate measure of firm size and created three sub categories firms with a single office 319 out of 553 or 57 7 percent firms with two or three offices 142 out of 553 or 25 7 percent and firms with four or more offices 92 out of 553 or 16 6 percent The firms with a single office average 86 9 legal professionals firms with two or three offices average 204 7 legal professionals and firms with four or more offices average 454 7 legal professionals The Table 1 shows the relationship between the number of offices per firm and other firm characteristics 28 Because the focus on this analysis is on firm characteristics average or mean of firm percentages are used to better reflect individual firm characteristics Table 1 Relationship Between the Number of Offices per Firm and Other Explanatory Variables EEO 1 Data Percentages Law Offices Per Firm Firm in Top 100 Prestige Profits Rankings Total Legal Employees in Top Ten Legal Markets One or More Southern Offices One Law Office 5 0 37 9 29 5 Two Three Law Offices 19 0 49 0 57 7 Four or More Law Offices 48 9 59 3 79 3 The number of law offices per firm is closely associated with the other organizational characteristics The greater the number of law offices per firm the greater the proportion of firms ranked among the top one hundred law firms and the greater the proportion of legal employees located in the top ten legal markets 29 The average percentage of firms ranked in the top one hundred by prestige and earnings increases from five percent in law firms with a single office to 48 9 percent in firms with four or more offices Likewise the average percent of legal employees in the top ten legal markets increases from 37 9 percent in law firms with a single office to 59 3 percent in firms with four or more offices It also should be noted that law firms with four or more offices are highly likely to have at least one office in a southern state Essentially it appears that the firms with four or more offices represent relatively large national and in some cases international law firms many of whom are well known and highly regarded within their field The firms with fewer offices are likely to be smaller regional firms that serve a more limited client base To examine the diversity characteristics of different types of law firms we analyzed the following proportions 30 Proportion of Women Legal Professionals in All Offices of a Law Firm Proportion of Minority Legal Professionals in All Offices of a Law Firm Table 2 summarizes both the total percentage and the average percentage of women and minority legal professionals by type of law firm Table 2 Professionals by Type of Firm EEO 1 Data Total Percentages Average of Percentages Law Offices Women Minorities Women Minorities One 38 0 9 6 37 7 9 1 Two or Three 39 0 13 5 38 2 11 8 Four or More 41 7 13 8 41 6 13 2 Probability 0 0169 0001 Total percentages combine all employees in all firms together The average of percentages is the mean percentage of minorities and women at each individual firm While these numbers are very similar the latter is more appropriate for capturing firm behavior In Table 2 the average percentages for women and for minorities are larger in law firms with four or more offices than in law firms with a single office but these proportional differences for minorities shows greater statistical significance than the proportional differences for women 31 The average percentage of women increases from 37 7 in law firms with a single office to 41 6 in law firms with four or more offices The probability of observing overall differences in the average percentage of women is about two chances out of one hundred 0 0169 32 Likewise the average percentage of minorities increases from 9 1 percent in law firms with a single office to 0 13 2 percent in law firms with four or more offices The probability of observing overall differences in the average percentage of women is about one chance out of ten thousand 0 0001 33 Thus minority legal professionals are more likely to be found in the largest law firms and the average percentage of minorities tend to vary more by the type of law firm measured by number of offices than does the percentage of women 34 The employment of minorities is more varied across firms than the employment of women even when controlling for number of firm offices 35 This suggests that minority legal professionals might be concentrated in certain firms Perhaps equally important these variations for both women and minorities decline when the number of law firm offices increase The percentages of women and minorities tend to be somewhat more uniform among those firms with four or more offices while the percentages of minorities and women changes from firm to firm when those firms have just one office 36 The relationships between the proportion of minority and women legal professionals in a firm and firm characteristics are examined in greater detail Regression analyses are computed separately for law firms with one office two or three offices and four or more offices Given the importance of number of offices this is done to gain insights into what characteristics influence the proportion of minorities and women when number of offices is held constant Table 3 summarizes the regression results for women 37 Firm characteristics used as explanatory variables appear to have relatively little effect on the proportion of women legal professionals within the different types of law firms There are no statistically significant relationships 38 for either law firms with two or three offices or law firms with four or more offices The only statistically significant relationship is represented by a single explanatory variable for law firms with one office In law firms with one office there is some indication that women legal professionals are less likely to be found in law firms located in the Southern Census Region a standardized parameter value of 0 134 and a T probability value of 0 018 Table 3 Regression Results for Women Law Firms with One

there are strong effects from both location in a top ten legal market and a top 100 ranking for either prestige or profits per partner Minority legal professionals are more likely to be located in law firms with a large proportion of professional employees in the top ten legal markets a standardized parameter value of 0 230 and a T probability value of 0 013 They are also more likely to be associated with law firms ranked in the top100 law firms by prestige or profits per partner a standardized parameter value of 0 252 and a T probably value of 0 012 The ability of firm characteristics to explain the proportion of minority legal professionals is much weaker for firms with four or more offices Taken as a whole the examined firm characteristics has limited value in explaining or predicting the proportion of minorities probability of 0 040 Further the strongest single effect proportion of legal employees in the top ten legal markets is not significantly different from having no effect In essence then minorities are more likely to be employed in firms with more offices Their employment increases in firms with two or three offices when these firms exhibit characteristics associated with firms with more offices location in large markets and top 100 rankings For single office firms location in a large market increases minority employment Generally speaking firm characteristics used in this study appear to have more effect on the proportion of minority legal professionals than the proportion of women legal professionals In addition it should be noted that the relative size of a law firm that is the total number of legal professionals has little or no effect on diversity proportions within the different types of law firms as defined by the number of offices Perhaps the most important result concerns the absence of explained variations in diversity proportions among law firms with four or more offices The large nationally known law firms generally have a higher proportion of women and minorities than other types of law firms and there appears to be substantial amount of uniformity within this group at least for the variables measured in this study 39 Summary An examination of the 2002 EEO 1 data on legal professionals in private law firms has several broad implications for civil rights enforcement In large national law firms the most pressing issues have probably shifted from hiring and initial access to problems concerning the terms and conditions of employment especially promotion to partnership In smaller regional and local law firms questions about the fairness and openness of hiring practices probably still remain particularly for minority lawyers The next section will examine some general characteristics of promotion patterns in large private law firms Status Within the Firm Partners and Associates A major issue in law firms generally is the movement from an associate attorney to a partner Beckman and Phillips explain promotion to partner not only involves the greatest increase in income within the law firm but the partnership includes membership to a professional elite with access to substantial social and political capital Nelson 1988 More generally partners of large corporate law firms are among the elite class in the U S Mills 1956 Smigel 1969 Domhoff 1998 Given the power and influence that accompanies large law firm partnership women s and minorities attainment within law firms has larger societal ramifications for access and opportunities Hagan and Kay 1995 p 6 40 This promotion takes on special meaning for women and minorities since the decision is often viewed as being subjective and thus subject to non relevant factors such as race ethnicity or gender41 p 521 Dixon and Seron describe decision making in law firms Partners in firms typically rely on centralized informal collective decision making through consensus of the partners rather than decentralized formal rule bound decision making via bureaucratic processes p 389 42 The study Perceptions of Partnership The Allure and Accessibility of the Brass Ring found gender and race ethnic disparities in the perception regarding equity in the opportunity for advancement to partnership With respect to the partnership decision when examining survey responses from associates in firms with more than 100 employees 74 3 percent of male associates felt opportunities were equally available to all but only 50 0 percent of women associates felt that way Similarly 70 2 percent of non minority associates in these type of firms felt opportunities for partnership were equal but only 30 8 percent of minority associates have the same perception 43 There are few data sources that allow the comparison of associates and partners Such detailed data is not collected on the EEO 1 or relevant Current Population Survey or Census data The National Association of Legal Placement NALP however conducts an annual survey of law firms to obtain information about their work forces which includes race ethnic and gender data by partner and associate job categories A copy of the form used to collect this information can be found in Appendix A This published data44 was utilized to examine the relationship between associates and partners In order to analyze the NALP data it was necessary to enter the data manually from the hard copy directory Therefore a sample of firms was utilized The EEO 1 data base was used to select the sample firms The sample was drawn from a population of all headquarter facilities in the Legal Service industry filing EEO 1 reports in 2002 There were 1 231 total establishments but just 508 headquarters reports from which the sample could be drawn Seeking at least a ten percent sample and recognizing that not all firms that file an EEO 1 report would necessarily file a report from the NALP a random sample of 125 was drawn from the EEO 1 data subset 45 Of these 33 were not included in the NALP Directory making the actual sample size 92 An odds ratio is computed and tested to examine the relationship between partner and associate 46 Comparisons are drawn between the control group of White men and the various groups of interest women African Americans Hispanics and Asians The odds ratio is based on the odds of White males being partners based on their employment as associates divided by the odds of the group of interest for example women being partners based on their employment as associates 47 When two groups have the same odds of being selected the odds ratio will be equal to one Based on the equation applied here the more the odds ratio exceeds one the more likely it is that White males will be partners The lower the odds ratio below one the more likely that the group of interest for example women will be partners The test here is not the probability that a female associate will become a partner necessary data is not available for that analysis Rather it is the chance that given a group of associates and attorneys in a firm a particular woman is a partner Thus the longevity of partners and historical lack of women and minority associates may produce odds that are different than a woman or a minority s odds of becoming a partner Nevertheless this odds ratio as applied here provides an insight into the status of women and minorities in these firms Also given the time required to become partner of five to nine years p 528 48 there has been some time for women and minorities participating in the large growth of law degrees obtained as discussed in a prior section to become partners Odds ratios are computed for each of the sample firms Table 5 displays the results when examining women attorneys The average number of women and White male associates in the sample firms are nearly identical 37 68 for women and 37 60 for White men However the mean number of White male partners far exceeds the mean number of women partners at 12 71 percent The mean odds ratio for this comparison is 5 330 clearly not even odds for the two groups There was only one instance where the computed odds ratio was at even odds 1 or lower The average sampled firm would require another 11 women partners to make the proportion of women partners match the proportion of female associates Table 5 White Male Attorneys and Women Attorneys Sample Private Law Firms Label

same as newly hired associates Due to the recent increase in women and minorities in the legal profession one would expect their experiences to be more limited than their White male counterparts For example in 1988 the median age reflecting experience for male attorneys was 42 but just 34 for women p 375 49 Further it does not account for variations in the frequency of partnership decisions However these results are not necessarily inconsistent with empirical research that controls for such factors For example Hull and Nelson report that C ontrolling for seniority and a wide range of other potentially relevant variables women s odds of working as law firm partners are less than one third of men s odds Because firm partners command the most money and prestige in the profession women occupy a distinctly unequal position among lawyers p 250 50 Table 6 displays the results for African American attorneys The mean number of African American associates in the sample firms is 4 413 and the mean number of African American partners is 1 076 The odds ratio does not approach the even odds of one On average it would require another African American partner at each sample firm to make the proportion of African American partners match the proportion of African American associates Of the 92 sample firms 87 94 57 percent have an odds ratio greater than one Table 6 White Male

Because the federal government does not collect data on disabled individuals employed in the legal profession the NALP data provides a unique opportunity to compare the status of disabled attorneys to non disabled attorneys This analysis summarized in Table 9 resembles those provided for other groups but the comparison group is not White males but all attorneys other than those reported as being disabled The mean number of disabled associates in the sample firms is 0 0761 and the mean number of disabled partners is 0 120 The odds ratio is very close to one at 1 226 Unfortunately given the

compared to Associate Professors to parallel the Associate to Partner decision Table 10 summarizes the results It was not possible to replicate the exact methodology utilized above because the level of detail in the data does not allow comparison groups based on White males Therefore women were compared to men and race ethnic groups were compared to White professors Data regarding disability was not available Table 10 Odds Ratios for Assistant and Associate Professors of Law GROUP ODDS RATIO ACTUAL EXPECTED WOMEN 1 07605 526 533 031 NATIVE AMERICAN 1 31538 13 14 389 ASIAN 1 06585 41 41 886

market competition and qualifications for the promotion from Assistant to Associate law professor seems likely to approximate that found in the movement from associate to partner in private law firms Summary Using an odds ratio to compare different gender and race ethnic groups chances of being partners in a sample of law firms suggests disparities between their odds and those of White men The group with the lowest probability of being partners is Asians with a mean odds ratio of 7 3 The second lowest group is African Americans 6 9 followed by women 5 3 and Hispanics 4 2 The relatively high standard deviation for these measures as shown in Table 5 through Table 9 suggests that not all firms within the sample behave the same so that some firms exhibit more equitable rates Additional

Employment Opportunity Commission Washington D C Methodological Appendix Comparison of EEO 1 and NALP Surveys The EEO 1 Survey of Establishments in Private Industry is designed to cover a wide range of industries and job groups To evaluate the accuracy of the EEO 1 information for law firms we compared the 2002 EEO 1 data for selected law firms to the 2002 2003 National Association for Law Placement NALP Directory of Legal Employers The analysis in this methodological appendix focuses on two main topics the extent of agreement or disagreement in estimating the total number of attorneys and the extent of agreement or disagreement in estimating the proportion of women and minorities In particular we compare the EEO 1 professional job group for legal services establishments to the NALP data on attorneys paralegals and other professionals Before examining the results we briefly summarize the instructions provided to EEO 1 and NALP respondents EEO 1 and NALP Survey Instructions The written EEO 1 survey instructions provide general descriptions of job group positions but they do not provide explicit instructions on the employees of legal services establishments Professionals Occupations requiring either college graduation or experience of such kind and amount as to provide a comparable background Includes accountants and auditors airplane pilots and navigators architects artists chemists designers dietitians editors engineers lawyers librarians mathematicians natural scientists registered professional nurses personnel and labor relations specialists physical scientists physicians social scientists teachers surveyors and kindred workers 52 For firms with multiple offices law firms are expected to follow the general EEO 1 instructions for establishments at different locations That is employment information on the main headquarters office is reported regardless of size Non headquarter offices with a minimum number of 50 or 100 employees should provide separate reports for each location In addition firms supply a consolidated report aggregating all offices together including offices with less than 50 total employees The NALP instructions include detailed definitions for selected types of law firm employees For example senior attorneys are defined as lawyers who were hired for a partnership track position but did not or have not yet become partners and who remained at the firm whether or not your firm refers to them by another name or lawyers who were hired for full time non partner positions Staff attorneys are defined as lawyers hired as non partnership track associates or for a fixed term of employment sometimes referred to as contract attorneys The terms partner member associate and paralegal are apparently undefined The information on hours worked is limited to full time partnership track associates but it is not clear whether the demographic information on associates includes part time employees The official supplying the information is asked whether the information reflects one office only or multiple offices It should be noted however there is no guidance about the minimum size required for reporting purposes nor is there a specification of what constitutes an office potentially a problematic issue for firms with multiple locations in the same city Comparison Sample To compare the corresponding information from the EEO 1 and NALP surveys we retrieved all establishments from the 2002 EEO 1 Survey with a Standard Industrial Classification code of 81 Legal Services a total of 1 231 establishments This sample did not include Hawaii as race ethnic data is not collected there We restricted the population to 782 establishments by only including those with more than one hundred total employees and more than fifteen professional employees Finally we restricted the analysis to headquarters firms only excluding all auxiliary field units From this universe of 508 establishments we drew a random sample of 125 establishments from the 2002 EEO 1 survey By matching firm names and address we were able to identify 92 law firms in the 2002 2003 NALP Directory of Legal Employers using NALP data as of February 1 2002 This represents 73 percent of the original sample and 18 percent of the EEO 1 reporting firms meeting the criteria for analysis Since NALP is a fee charging listing service designed to provide information to potential job seekers it seems likely that the unmatched firms either had other means of recruiting attorneys or chose not to hire attorneys in 2002 2003 Comparative Measures The EEO 1 survey provides three basic ways of measuring the total number of professional employees the total number of professional employees at the firm s headquarters the total number of professional employees in the firm s field units and the total number of professional employees overall For present purposes we concentrated on the first and third measures the headquarters report hereafter HD and the overall consolidated report hereafter CN We compared the HD and CN figures from the EEO 1 survey to seven potential measures of professional employment in the NALP survey the total number of associate attorneys53 the total number of non partner attorneys including associates of counsel senior attorneys and staff attorneys the total number of non partner attorneys plus non lawyer professionals such as economists accounts and lobbyists the total number of non partner attorneys plus non lawyer professionals and paralegals the total number of all attorneys including partners and non partners the total number of all attorneys plus non lawyer professionals such as economists accountants and lobbyists the total number of all attorneys non lawyer professionals and paralegals For each law firm we computed the absolute difference between the EEO 1 numbers and each of the NALP numbers producing a total of fourteen comparisons seven HD measures and seven CN measures We then identified the comparison that produced the smallest absolute difference and calculated a discrepancy proportion using the appropriate EEO 1 base either HD or CN Appendix Table 1 Hypothetical Example Hypothetical Example of Discrepancy Calculations Between EEO 1 and NALP EEO 1 Total Headquarter Professionals HD 157 EEO 1 Total Consolidated Professionals HD 181 NALP Categories

Professionals Paralegals 120 37 61 All Attorneys 119 38 62 Attorneys Other Professionals 151 6 30 Attorneys Professionals Paralegals 170 13 11 Appendix Table 1 provides an example of these discrepancy computations for a hypothetical law firm According to Appendix Table 1 the smallest HD discrepancy is a difference of six employees for the NALP category all attorneys plus other non lawyer professionals The proportional disagreement for the smallest HD discrepancy is 0 038 6 157 The smallest CN discrepancy is a difference of eleven employees for the NALP category all attorneys plus non lawyer professionals and paralegals The proportional disagreement for the smallest CN discrepancy is 0 061 11 181 Since the HD proportional disagreement of 0 038 is less than the CN proportional disagreement of 0 061 the overall proportional disagreement between the EEO 1 and NALP data sources is 0 038 The closest fit to the EEO 1 HD data would be assigned to the NALP data for all attorneys plus non lawyer professionals 54 Comparative Results for the Number of Law Firm Employees Appendix Table 2 summarizes the overall proportional disagreement between the EEO 1 and NALP data sources Appendix Table 2 Proportional Disagreement Between Data Sources Quartile Statistics Overall Proportional Disagreement 25 Percent Quartile 0 017 50 Percent Quartile 0 036 75 Percent Quartile 0 074 The median or fifty percent value is 0 036 Approximately one half of the observations fall within the range of 0 017 First Quartile to 0 074 Third Quartile The average proportional disagreement which is strongly influenced by extreme values is 0 054 with a standard deviation of 0 066 In a preliminary examination of these results eleven of the law firms with the largest discrepancies were reviewed in detail to determine if there were any systematic reasons for the differences Many of the differences appear to be consistent with the EEO 1 reporting requirements For example Law Firm A Disparity appears to be due to the combination of two offices in the sample city for the NALP survey but not the EEO 1 survey When the EEO 1 reports for two offices are grouped together the total number of EEO 1 professionals is within 4 6 percent of the NALP report for total attorneys and other professionals combined Law Firm B Although the NALP entry indicates that a collective form was used the NALP counts appear to come from a single office If the NALP entry is compared to the corresponding EEO 1 report for a single establishment and partners are eliminated from the NALP entry the NALP results are within 5 8 percent of the EEO 1 results Law Firm C The revised difference reduces to 6 7 percent if partners reported to NALP are not included Law Firm D Combining associates of counsel and other non lawyer professionals results in an exact match with the EEO 1 data Law Firm E The NALP data and the EEO 1 data can be made consistent under the following conditions The total number of professionals reported to the EEO 1 appears to equal the total number of Of Counsel Associates Staff Attorneys and Other Professionals reported to the NALP if one subtracts 22 technical workers on the EEO 1 report from the 32 other professionals on the NALP report We suspect that the firm includes technical workers in its NALP report because there is no technician category on the NALP The remaining firms with outlying discrepancies either cannot be readily explained or they may be law firms that incorrectly classify summer law students as professional employees Generally speaking the total number of professional employees reported to the EEOC is a fairly accurate proxy for the relative size of a law firm The correlations between the total number of professional employees in the EEO 1 survey and the number of attorneys in the NALP sample range from 0 516 to 0 813 The EEO 1 measure of professional employees has a 0 516 correlation with the NALP measure of total partners a 0 813 correlation with the NALP measure of total associates and a 0 781 correlation with the NALP measure of total attorneys all three correlations have probability values less than 0 0001 While the EEO 1 figures for professional employees is related to attorneys in a firm the figure lacks reliability as a measure for attorneys There are three main reasons for this reliability issue First some firms as noted above hire professionals other than attorneys While a small proportion of the professional work force it prevents exact tracking of attorney employment Second firms did not appear to be consistent in the manner in which they report partners In examining data from individual firms it is apparent that some include partners in their EEO 1 reporting and others do not Third some firms appear to include paralegals as professional employees on their EEO 1 report Appendix Table 3 Matching NALP Employment to EEO 1 Organizational Unit Report Type Organizational Unit Agreement percent Consolidated CONSOL 29 31 52 Headquarters HDQRT 63 68 48 Total 92 100 00 Perhaps the best way to see the attorneys plus others aspect of the EEO 1 data is to examine the discrepancies with the NALP data Approximately two thirds of the NALP law firms 68 5 percent are most closely matched to the EEO 1 headquarters data rather than the EEO 1 consolidated data This suggests that a majority of NALP respondents are reporting information based on a single location 55 See Appendix Table 3 Appendix Table 4 summarizes the assigned reasons for the EEO 1 and NALP discrepancies The rows identify the EEO

83 The columns identify the corresponding NALP data source job combination that produces the smallest discrepancy with the EEO 1 information The results can be interpreted in several different ways For many firms the total number of professional employees reported to the EEOC closely resembles that total number of attorneys reported to the NALP Combining all the attorney reasons together that is associates only non partners and all attorneys about two fifths of the law firms 40 92 or 43 5 percent report a similar number of employees on both surveys Within the combined attorney group the total number of attorneys is the dominant reason for reduced discrepancies 26 of 40 followed by the total number of non partners 12 of 40 In very few firms 2 2 percent does the EEO 1 professional category and the NALP associate attorneys category coincide In addition to lawyers a substantial number of law firms appear to include other selected occupations in the EEO 1 professional job group Non lawyer professionals such as accountants are unevenly distributed across law firms One quarter of the firms have no non lawyer professionals but the upper ten percent of the firms have 32 or more non lawyer professionals The median number of non lawyer professionals is seven employees per firm Grouping attorneys and other professionals together about three fifths of the law firms 56 92 or 60 9 percent report a similar number of total employees on both surveys The remaining law firms appear to classify paralegals as professional employees The median number of paralegals is 25 employees per firm The combined category of attorneys non lawyer professionals and paralegals constitute about two fifths 36 92 or 39 1 percent of the reasons for reduced discrepancies These results probably reflect the legitimate disagreements about controversies surrounding the terms legal secretary legal assistant and paralegal In summary it appears that the EEO 1 professional category is composed predominantly of attorneys with substantial number of law firms including non lawyer professionals and or paralegals About three fifths 57 92 or 62 0 percent of the law firms appear to report various combinations of all attorneys including both partners and associates to the EEOC and about two fifths 35 92 or 38 0 percent report various combinations of associate attorneys to the EEOC Diversity Results This section examines the relationship between diversity proportions for law firms in the EEO 1 survey and diversity proportions for law firms in the NALP survey Appendix Table 5 summarizes the overall proportion of women and minorities for law firms in the 2002 EEO 1 survey Appendix Table 5 Proportion of Women and Minorities Employed Sample versus Total EEO 1 Source Total Women Total Minorities Total Professionals Proportion Women Proportion Minorities All Law Firms 40 739 12 955 101 080 0 403 0 128 Random Sample 5 454 1 595 13 064 0 417 0 122 The first row represents all law firms in the 2002 EEO 1 survey a total of 1 231 observations and the second row represents the law firms in random sample with corresponding values in the NALP survey a total of 92 observations The proportions of women and minorities from the two EEO 1 sources have similar values between 0 403 and 0 417 for women and between 0 122 and 0 128 for minorities This suggests that the random sample accurately reflects the proportion of women and minorities among EEO 1 law firms as a whole The next two tables summarize the proportion of women and minorities in the 2002 2003 NALP survey organized by associate and partner attorneys Appendix Table 6 examines summary data for all firms while Appendix Table 7 only looks at the sample of NALP reporting firms used in this report Appendix Table 7

110 556 Again the proportions of women and minorities from the two NALP data sources are in close agreement Notice that EEO 1 proportions generally track the NALP proportions for associates rather than the NALP proportions for partners or for associates and partners combined together Comparing population values the EEO 1 and NALP proportional differences among associates are approximately 0 02 0 021 0 403 0 424 for women and 0 015 0 128 0 143 for minorities The corresponding proportional differences among partners are 0 240 0 403 0 163 for women and 0 091 0 128 0 037 The corresponding proportional differences among associates and partners combined are 0 096 0 403 0 307 for women and 0 032 0 128 0 096 for minorities Appendix Table 8 Partners and Associates for Sample NALP Reporting

proportions for professionals appear to be in general agreement with the NALP diversity proportions for associate attorneys Given that approximately two thirds of the law firms appear to be reporting EEO 1 professional data for partners and associates combined why are the EEO 1 diversity proportions substantially higher than the NALP diversity proportions for partners and associates combined There are no conclusive answers to these questions but the following tables are instructive Appendix Table 9 is restricted to the fifty nine sampled law firms reporting similar employee numbers on both the EEO 1 and the NALP surveys defined as proportional disparities of 0 05 or less It compares the imputed discrepancy categories derived from the NALP data to the EEO 1 diversity proportions for women and minorities The first row represents sampled law firms with associate and non partner discrepancy explanations associate only non partner non partner plus other professionals and non partner plus other professionals and paralegals The second row represents sampled law firms with partner and non partner discrepancy explanations all attorneys all attorneys plus other professionals and all attorneys plus other professionals and paralegals That is the first row excludes partner attorneys and the second row includes both associate and partner attorneys The NALP results would suggest that the diversity proportions should be higher for EEO 1 responses that exclude partners than for EEO 1 responses that include partners Consistent with the NALP results the diversity proportions for the first row are higher than the diversity proportions are for the second row The proportions of women are 0 463 and 0 375 respectively and the proportions of minorities are 0 151 and 0 116 respectively Since some of the law firms classified as non partners probably include paralegals and other professionals in their EEO 1 reports the diversity proportions for non partner respondents on the EEO 1 survey should also be higher than the diversity proportions for pure associates reported to the NALP This expectation is generally confirmed especially for the proportion of women For sampled law firms classified as non partner respondents the proportion of women is 0 463 on the EEO 1 survey compared to a proportion of 0 428 among associate attorneys on the NALP survey Likewise the proportion of minorities is 0 151 compared to 0 146 among associate attorneys on the NALP survey These results suggest that discrepancy categories derived from a comparison of total number of employees on the two surveys are also plausible or at least potential explanations for the diversity proportions in the sampled law firms Appendix Table 9 Sampled Law Firms with Proportional Differences of 0 05 or

partners associates and paralegals in the EEO 1 professional category As described earlier the NALP data reports employment totals for a wide range of occupational groups but it only reports diversity numbers for selected occupational groups partners associates summer students and auxiliary attorneys The EEO 1 survey does not differentiate among different types of professional employees that might be present in law firms Based on household occupation data from the 2002 Current Population Survey CPS we made rough estimates for the missing NALP diversity proportions among non lawyer professionals and paralegals and then used these NALP diversity estimates to predict the overall diversity proportions among EEO 1 professional employees Specifically we proceeded as follows The sample was limited to law firms with minimal discrepancy proportions i e discrepancy proportions of 0 05 or less a total of fifty nine law firms The EEO 1 diversity proportions were computed using the appropriate baseline assigned by the discrepancy measure either the proportion of headquarters professionals or the proportion of consolidated professionals Because of time limitations the NALP category of senior attorneys of counsel etc was eliminated Diversity proportions for the NALP category of non lawyer professionals were estimated by averaging the 2002 CPS data for accountants and economists an average proportion of 0 570 for women and 0 076 for minorities Diversity proportions for the NADP paralegal category were estimated by the 2002 CPS data for legal assistants proportions of 0 822 and 0 181 for women and minorities respectively The remaining NALP categories were based on the actual NALP sample data for partners and associates The overall NALP diversity was calculated using the appropriate discrepancy category for the sampled firm For example law firms classified as non partners plus non lawyer professionals were based on the actual number of NALP women and minority associates plus the estimated number of women and minorities among non lawyer professionals In a similar fashion law firms classified as all attorneys plus non lawyer professionals and paralegals were based on the actual number of women and minorities among partner and associate lawyers plus the estimated number of women and minorities among non lawyer professionals and paralegals We then compared the predicted diversity proportions obtained from the combination of actual and estimated NALP data to the actual diversity proportions in the EEO 1 data The objective of this exercise was to assess the reasonableness of the NALP data as a proxy for the different types of legal sub groups likely to be present in the EEO 1 data If we could show that the NALP diversity estimates closely approximated the EEO 1 diversity proportions we then have a basis for extrapolating the NALP occupational allocations to the EEO 1 data As expected the NALP diversity estimates derived from the appropriate legal sub groups provide a close approximation to the diversity proportions reported to the EEOC The EEO 1 proportion of women is 0 4023 compared to an NALP estimate of 0 3826 a difference of 0 0197 The EEO 1 proportion of minorities is 0 1246 compared to an NALP estimate of 0 1152 a difference of 0 0094 Neither of these proportional differences is statistically significant Based on the NALP sample the corresponding EEO 1 submissions are on average likely to be composed of the following legal sub groups in Appendix Table 10 The third column shows the proportion of different legal sub groups in the NALP sample The fourth column shows the average proportion of women within these sub groups The fifth column combines the information on sub group proportions and average proportions of women to estimate a weighted average proportion of women for each sub group The results suggest that about three fourths 75 86 percent of the professional employees reported to the EEOC are either partner or associate attorneys Associates form the largest legal sub group in the EEO 1 42 0 percent followed by partners 33 8 percent paralegals 16 9 percent and non lawyer professionals 7 3 percent Appendix Table 10 Average Proportion of Women by Job Sub Groups NALP Sample Group Proportions Average Proportion Women Estimated Weighted Average Partners 4 047 0 3382 0 163 0 0551 Associates 5 031 0 4204 0 424 0 1783 Other Professionals 868 0 0725 0 570 0 0413 Paralegals 2 022 0 1690 0 822 0 1389 Total 11 968 1 0000 0 4136 Although these sub group percentages are only rough approximations the estimated weighted averages help to explain why the overall EEO 1 diversity proportions tend to track the NALP diversity proportions for associate attorneys Although non lawyer professionals and paralegals are the smallest legal sub groups they each have a relatively high proportion of women and minorities Combined together the weighted average for women among non lawyer professionals and paralegals 0 1802 is almost equal to the weighted average among associate attorneys 0 1783 Likewise the weighted average for minorities among non lawyer professionals and paralegals 0 0434 is almost equal to the weighted average among associate attorneys 0 0600 Thus on average the relatively small number of women and minority partners is counter balanced by a combination of other legal sub groups that are similar to associate attorneys in terms of overall contributions to the proportion of women Put another way the EEO 1 data seems to provide a fairly accurate surrogate measure of diversity among associate attorneys at least in the current time period not because the EEO 1 data is a strict measure of associate employment but because the mixture of attorneys plus other occupations produces diversity proportions much closer to the proportions for associate attorneys than the proportions for all attorneys partners and associates pooled together Summary Although the relationships between the EEO 1 and NALP surveys are complex and tenuous two general principles seem evident First because the EEO 1 professional category seems to be composed predominantly of attorneys combined with selected other legal sub groups the EEO 1 data provides a fairly accurate index of a relative firm size but it is not a reliable guide to the actual number of partners and associates in any given law firm Second the particular mixture of legal sub groups covered in the EEO 1 survey appear on average to provide a plausible indicator of diversity among associate attorneys but they do not appear to be representative of diversity among partner attorneys or partner and associate attorneys combined Finally the measurement problems reviewed in this appendix suggest that the available information on law firms would be greatly improved if all of the organizations responsible for collecting data on law firms could reach a consensus on the appropriate measurement standards to be applied to law firm surveys For example the NALP survey provides detailed information on specific legal sub groups such as partners associates and senior attorneys but respondents appear to need more guidance on the appropriate definition of a law firm s office especially when multiple offices are located in the same geographic area Likewise the EEO 1 survey provides fairly detailed definitions for law firm locations but respondents appear to need more guidance on how to allocate specific legal sub groups among the EEO 1 job groups Hopefully this appendix has suggested various ways in which the available law firm surveys can be compared and contrasted to yield insights that might not be evident from any given survey taken by itself SELECTED REFERENCES Beckman Christine M and Damon J Phillips

methodological appendix provides analyses comparing EEO 1 reports to a sample of law firms It specifically examines the relationship between the EEO 1 professional job group and more detailed job titles in law firms While reliability problems are documented a relationship between the professional EEO 1 job group and the associate job title is suggested For the purpose of this report law firms are defined based on the Standard Industrial Classification code for Legal Services A parallel code exists for the North American Industrial Classification System The EEO 1 reports used in this report did not include those from Hawaii as race ethnic data is not collected there 16 Current Population Survey data is a national monthly survey of approximately 60 000 households conducted by the Bureau of the Census for the Bureau of Labor Statistics The data used is Household Data Annual Averages Employed Persons by Detailed Occupation Sex Race and Hispanic Origin The 2002 data is available at http

on the website http www nalp org nalpresearch mw02sum htm www nalp org nalpresearch mw02sum htm 21 Readers are reminded that the EEO 1 survey uses a broad definition of professional employees that covers attorneys as well as other non attorney legal occupations For the reasons described in the appendix it appears that the EEO 1 data on legal professionals provides a fairly representative index of diversity among associate attorneys Readers are also reminded that because of establishment size limitations the EEO 1 survey not provide information on solo practitioners or relatively small law firms Therefore this report examines relative variations in firm size within a group of medium to relatively large law firms 22 The total number of EEO 1 legal professionals for this purpose represents the sum from all reporting establishments with a common headquarters number and is not necessarily equivalent to the consolidated totals discussed in the methodological appendix 23 For a list of the states in each of the nine Census Bureau divisions see the description on the website http www bls gov help def la htm www bls gov help def la htm 24 The list of the top 100 law firms ranked by profits per partner was taken from The American Lawyer November 2002 The list of the top 100 law firms ranked by prestige was taken from The Top 100 Most Prestigious Firms 2002 The Vault 2002 Firms on either list were assigned a value of 1 otherwise a value of 0 25 The top ten legal markets were estimated by aggregating the number of EEO 1 legal professionals by city and then ranking the cities by the proportion of all legal professionals in the 2002 EEO 1 survey The top ten cities encompassing approximately 60 percent of all legal professions in the 2002 EEO 1 survey were New York Washington DC Chicago Los Angeles Boston San Francisco Philadelphia Houston Dallas and Atlanta 26 Southern states were defined by the Census Bureau South Region covered the states of Delaware District of Columbia Florida Georgia Maryland North Carolina South Carolina Virginia West Virginia Alabama Kentucky Mississippi Tennessee Arkansas Louisiana Oklahoma and Texas This variable is used to capture the higher availability of minorities particularly African Americans in this area 27 The correlations among these three variables range from 0 739 to 0 820 A multivariate factor analysis not reported here suggests that these three variables should be treated as a single factor 28 The variations in these average proportions are all statistically significant with F probability values of 0 002 or less 29 These proportions are the mean of each firm s proportion 30 It should be noted that the diversity percentages reported here are summary measures computed by summing all establishments with a common EEO 1 headquarters number Since EEO 1 data is not collected from non headquarter offices with less than 50 total employees these percentages are not equivalent to the consolidated figures on legal professionals discussed in the appendix 31 The F probability values were computed with angular transformations of the proportional diversity values Angular transformations are designed to achieve a constant error variance i e they reduce the likelihood of a wider range of errors around 0 5 than around 0 01 or 0 99 See for example the discussion of variance stabilizing transformations font family Times New Roman in Michael font family Times New Roman O Finkelstein and Bruce Levin Statistics forLawyers 1990 p 441 32 Using the Tukey Studentized Range Test the comparison between firms with a single office and firms with four or more offices 0 039 is statistically significant at the 0 05 level but none of the other law firm comparisons i e between single offices and two or three offices and between two or three offices and four or more offices are statistically significant at the 0 05 level 33 Using the Tukey Studentized Range Test all of the law firm minority comparisons are statistically significant at the 0 05 level except for the comparison between law firms with two or three offices and law firms with four or more offices 34 These EEO 1 results are generally consistent with the 2002 NALP results 35 This is based on an examination of variations in the proportion of minorities and women among different firms When the mean values of two groups are unequal variations around the mean are usually measured by a coefficient of variation expressed as a percentage computed as the standard deviation divided by the mean For example in Table 2 the average proportion of women in single office firms is 0 377 the standard deviation is 0 13225 making the coefficent of variation 0 3504 0 13225 0 377 or 35 percent The higher the coefficient the greater than the relative dispersion around the mean or average value The coefficients of variation for women range from 20 percent to 35 percent and the coefficients of variation for minorities range from 46 percent to 85 percent 36 Specifically for the percentage of women the coefficient of variation decreases from 35 percent in firms with a single office to 20 percent in firms with four or more offices For the percentage of minorities the coefficient of variation decreases from 85 percent in firms with a single office to 46 percent in firms with four or more offices 37 The F probability value shows the statistical significance of the overall regression equation The standardized parameter value shows the relative strength and direction of each explanatory variable ranging from 1 strong positive effect to 1 strong negative effect The T probability values show the statistical significance of each explanatory variable controlling for the effects of the other variables in the equation The dependent variables that is the variables that are being explained or predicted by the regression equation are the proportions of women and minority legal professionals in a law firm standardized by angular transformations 38 Statistical significance level used here is a probability value less than or equal to 0 05 39 The best fitting models in this study minority proportions for law firms with one office and two or three offices have adjusted R squared values of 0 124 and 0 185 respectively This suggests that there may be other explanatory variables not available in the EEO 1 survey that need to be considered e g firms with different types of legal specialties such as bankruptcy criminal practice tax law corporate mergers etc For a major study of elite law firms that uses

upper right box labeled Demographics the other in a matrix containing counts by gender and minorities We retained both measures and compared each measure separately to the NALP data For the purpose of computing overall discrepancy statistics we used the associate sub total that produced the smallest discrepancy 54 This discrepancy measure compares the relative proportion of EEO 1 and NALP employees and therefore may be subject to random fluctuations especially for small numeric differences Other discrepancy measures incorporating estimates of measurement and sampling error between the two data sources could yield different discrepancy assignments For example the effective dates of the two surveys are likely to produce different employment totals reflecting the timing of new hires and terminations particularly in cases of high turnover We have not attempted to set a threshold for distinguishing between significant and insignificant discrepancy values 55 NALP respondents were asked whether the information provided was for one law office only or multiple law offices We compared the NALP responses collective form equals N and Y to the designations of headquarter and consolidated discrepancies used in this study The two measures of office aggregation levels are not strongly related About one half of the consolidated designations 48 3 percent had a collective form value of N and about two fifths of the headquarter designations 42 9 percent had a collective form value of Y The likelihood that differences of this magnitude could have arisen by chance is 0 502 using a two sided Fisher s Exact Test 56 See for example the discussions under the heading Definition of a Paralegal on the website for the National Federation of Paralegal Associates Inc www paralegals org 57 Readers are reminded that the discrepancy reasons were assigned on the basis of numeric differences between the EEO 1 and NALP surveys In the absence of interviews with the responding officials there is no conclusive way to determine how law firms allocated employees among the different EEO 1 job groups 58 The Z score for women is 0 2197 a two sided probability value of 0 826 and a Z score for minorities is 0 3294 a two sided probability value of 0 742 59 Readers are reminded that the estimates for the average proportion of women among non lawyer professionals and paralegals are based on the 2002 CPS data rather than the NALP sample It also should be noted that the NALP predictions described above used the actual diversity numbers for partners and associates in each law firm rather than overall averages This page was last modified on October 22 2003 index html Link to home page of EEOC web site Home index html Link to home page of EEOC web site Return to Home Page
