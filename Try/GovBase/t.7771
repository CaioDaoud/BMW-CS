levels and it has been shown that the earlier drug use is initiated the more likely a person is to develop drug problems later in life note1 1 Youth substance abuse can lead to many other problems including the development of delinquent behavior anti social attitudes and health related issues These problems not only affect the child but can also influence the child s family community and ultimately society note2 2 Prevalence Estimates According to the http www samhsa gov oas nhsda htm 2002 National Survey on Drug Use and Health 11 6 percent of youths age 12 to 17 reported current use of illicit drugs in 2002 Approximately 30 of youths reported using an illicit drug at least once during their lifetime and 22 2 reported using an illicit drug within the past year Marijuana was the major illicit drug used for this age group with 8 2 of youths being current users note3 3 Percent of Persons Aged 12 to 17 Reporting Illicit Drug Use 2002 Percent of high school stuents reporting drug use Drug Type Lifetime Past Year Past Month Any Illicit Drug 30 9 22 2 11 6 Marijuana and Hashish 20 6 15 8 8 2 Cocaine 2 7 2 1 0 6 Crack 0 7 0 4 0 1 Heroin 0 4 0 2 0 0 LSD 2 7 1 3 0 2 PCP 0 9 0 4 0 1 Ecstasy 3 3 2 2 0 5 Inhalants 10 5 4 4 1 2 Methamphetamine 1 5 0 9 0 3 According to the http www monitoringthefuture org Monitoring the Future Survey in 2002 past month use of any illicit drug was highest for twelfth graders 25 4 followed by tenth graders 20 8 and was lowest among eighth graders 10 4 Twelfth graders on average had higher percentages of use on all drugs when compared to eight and tenth grades In 2002 lifetime prevalence of use of illicit drugs for eighth tenth and twelfth graders was 24 5 44 6 and 53 0 respectively note4 4 Percent of high school students reporting drug use 2002 Percent of high school stuents reporting drug use Student Drug Use Eighth Grade Tenth Grade Twelfth Grade Past month use 10 4 20 8 25 4 Past year use 17 7 34 8 41 0 Lifetime use 24 5 44 6 53 0 By eighth grade 47 of youth report having tried alcohol more than just a few sips and 21 3 say they have already been drunk at least once About one third of eighth graders 31 4 have tried cigarettes A surprisingly large number of eighth grade students 8 7 say they have tried amphetamines 2 8 say they have used amphetamines in the prior 30 days The large number of students who have already begun use of the so called gateway drugs tobacco alcohol inhalants and marijuana suggests that a substantial number of eighth grade students are already at risk of proceeding further to such drugs as LSD cocaine amphetamines and heroin note5 5 According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC http www cdc gov mmwr preview mmwrhtml ss5104a1 htm 2001 Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System YRBSS 42 4 of high school students surveyed nationwide used marijuana during their lifetime Overall male students 46 5 were significantly more likely than female students 38 4 to report lifetime marijuana use Nationwide 9 4 of students had used a form of cocaine e g powder crack or freebase during their lifetime 14 7 of students had sniffed glue breathed the contents of aerosol spray cans or inhaled paints or spray to get high during their lifetime Overall male students 3 8 were significantly more likely than female students 2 5 to report lifetime heroin use 9 8 of students had used methamphetamine during their lifetime note6 6 Consequences of Use Persistent substance abuse by young people often leads to academic difficulties health related problems including mental health poor peer relationships and involvement with the juvenile justice system Additionally there are consequences for family members the community and the entire society note7 7 Mental health problems including depression developmental lags apathy withdrawal and other psychosocial dysfunctions are frequently linked to substance abuse among adolescents Substance abusing youth are at higher risk than nonusers for mental health problems including depression conduct problems personality disorders suicidal thoughts attempted suicide and suicide Marijuana use which is prevalent among youth has been shown to interfere with short term memory learning and psychomotor skills Motivation and psychosexual emotional development also may be influenced note8 8 Substance abuse among youth has also been strongly linked to delinquency Arrest adjudication and intervention by the juvenile justice system are eventual consequences for many youth engaged in alcohol and other drug use Substance abuse does not directly cause delinquent behavior and delinquency does not directly cause alcohol and other drug use However the two behaviors are strongly correlated and often bring about school and family problems involvement with negative peer groups a lack of neighborhood social controls and physical or sexual abuse note9 9 Drug Episode A drug related ED episode is an ED visit that was induced by or related to the use of drug s Drug Mention A drug mention refers to a substance that was recorded during an ED episode Because up to 4 drugs can be reported for each drug abuse episode there are more mentions than episodes The http www samhsa gov oas dawn htm Drug Abuse Warning Network DAWN study reports the number of people seeking emergency department ED treatment related to illegal drug use or non medical use of legal drugs ED episodes for persons ages 12 to 17 increased from 82 904 during 1999 to 97 029 during 2002 Of the 97 029 episodes in 2002 marijuana was mentioned 18 845 times cocaine was mentioned 3 497 times methamphetamine was mentioned 1 230 times and heroin was mentioned 813 times note10 10 According to the 2001 DAWN Mortality data drug abuse deaths among adolescents were rare Descendents under the age of 25 accounted for less than 20 of DAWN cases across the 42 metropolitan areas and accounted for 10 or less of all drug abuse deaths in about half of participating metropolitan areas note11 11 Treatment Treating youth for substance abuse can be complicated The normal factors that must be considered when admitting an individual to substance abuse treatment include determining the severity of the substance use cultural background and presence of coexisting disorders In addition treatment programs dealing with youth must consider the individual s age level of maturity and the family and peer environment of the youth note12 12 Adolescent treatment admissions admissions between the ages of 12 to 17 to treatment facilities in the U S increased 38 percent between 1992 95 000 admissions and 2000 131 176 admissions Marijuana admissions grew from 23 in 1992 to 62 during 2000 Seventy one percent of adolescent admissions were male but this proportion was heavily influenced by marijuana admissions where 76 were male The male to female ratio was closer for other substances About half 51 of adolescent admissions to treatment in 2000 were referred by the criminal justice system Seventeen percent were self or individual referrals and 11 percent were referred through schools note13 13 Arrests and Adjudication According to the Federal Bureau of Investigation s http www fbi gov ucr ucr htm Crime in the United States there were 116 781 juveniles under the age of 18 arrested for drug abuse violations in 2002 note14 14 According to
