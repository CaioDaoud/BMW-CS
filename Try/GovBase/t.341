temporal resolution of both Landsat Thematic Mapper referred to as Landsat TM or TM which have been collected since 1983 and landsat html Landsat MSS data is about two weeks The TM data have a spatial resolution of 30 meters compared to 75 meters for the MSS and six rather than four spectral bands three visible bands blue green and red versus two for the MSS data plus a near infrared and two mid infrared bands versus two near infrared for the MSS Therefore more detailed regional and local eolian erosion vulnerability image maps can be generated using the TM data However like the MSS data its temporal resolution of about two weeks makes the data not very useful for monitoring and detecting active dust storms Also because of the relatively high spatial resolution of the TM data compared to GOES SeaWiFS and WiFS detailed analysis of vegetation dynamics at dust source sites can be made In the deserts with the two week revisit time and commonly cloud free conditions it is usually not diffcult to find multitemporal TM data for change analysis between different years and or seasons to evaluate vegetation changes caused by climate variations at both regional and relatively local scales This type of multitemporal vegetation change analysis is an important part of this project Landsat TM Characteristics Spatial Resolution 30 m Spectral Resolution 3 visible 1 NIR 2 mid IR

represents land surface conditions during a dry season in a dry year The data are being used to compare with a digital image mosaic generated using 1992 Landsat TM images which represents land surface conditions during a wet season in a wet El Ni o year The wet year image mosaic was generated using Landsat TM images collected during April 1992 graphs precip 9297 html Figure 1 lower left shows the

issues including those dealing with vegetation change and the transport of fine sediments we are also using the image maps to extract information about soil types vegetation cover and surface armouring protection The spatial resolution of the mosaics is 30 meters Landsat TM bands 2 4 and 5 were used to generated the color composite shown on the left In order to better show the land surface information in both bright and dark regions on a single product a large spatial filter was applied to the data Click the 1997 Landsat TM image mosaic thumbnail image upper left to view the mosaic at
