Web aspects Distributed Collaboratory Experiment Environments The fusion of computers and electronic communications has the potential to dramatically enhance the output and productivity of U S researchers A major step toward realizing that potential can come from combining the interests of the scientific community at large with those of the computer science and engineering community to create integrated tool oriented computing and communication systems to support scientific collaboration Such systems can be called collaboratories From National Collaboratories Applying Information Technology for Scientific Research Committee on a National Collaboratory National Research Council National Academy Press Washington D C 1993 The DCEE program has made several significant contributions to making this vision a reality The draft final report of the DCEE program now replaced by the DOE2000 program is available at the http www itg lbl gov DCEE DCEE hompage The ALS Spectro

Increasingly their value will come from their connectivity and from users ability to find and share resources over the networks High performance has a synergistic effect when teamed with this connectivity The ability to use high speed networks to transparently provide distributed computing and collaboration depends on technology advances in several areas of software and hardware Throughout the industrialized world massive efforts are underway in government laboratories universities and corporations to help this field progress and reap its rewards Our contributions center around experiments that are driven by imaging applications strategic collaborations made possible or made better by networking and high speed distributed computing The fields that benefit range from health care to the quest to develop fusion energy Research Collaboration Program This program of collaboration between LBNL and http www cite cnpq br CNPq Brazil was established via a http www itg lbl gov
