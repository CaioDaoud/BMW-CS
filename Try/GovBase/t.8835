Safe Maritime Navigation HOME SAFE MARITIME NAVIGATION co ops html The IMGSRC images backgrey gif ALT Back BORDER 0 Back The goal is to revolutionize virtually all aspects of marine transportation operations by providing accurate and timely navigation information translating into cost savings from more efficient ship routing and transit timing safer entry to and exit from port and accurate spatial reference data Ships have doubled in length width and draft in the past 50 years and seagoing commerce has tripled Every day more than 100 tank ships and thousands of other vessels transit U S ports carrying half the nation s petroleum and more than 99 percent by weight of its foreign trade And each day there are nearly 4 groundings collisions rammings of commercial vessels One third could be avoided by the use of electronic charts a loss saving of 3 6M each day Electronic chart systems could realize benefit cost ratios of 6 1 from safety benefits alone 1 Comparing technologies the costefx html cost effectiveness of electronic charts is six times better than that for double hull vessels and at least the same order of magnitude as the use of vessel traffic service systems To reduce navigational risks maintain safety preserve the environment and spur economic growth the navigational services provided by NOS are being improved Better electronic charting capabilities will reduce the number of accidents that are due to human error Real time access such as that provided by the National Water Level Observation Program and the national network of Physical Oceanographic Real Time Systems in major U S harbors to present and short term forecasted water level tidal and current data will allow U S port authorities and shippers to make sound decisions regarding the off loading and on loading of materials and ship movement along the coast This is the CO OPS contribution If an accident occurs nevertheless resulting in an oil spill for instance these data will enhance response capabilities And there are many ways in which improved navigational information will support NOAA s environmental stewardship mission For example precise coastal maps and water level information provide the basis for flood warnings and making policy decisions about coastal zone management including the appropriateness of waterfront development Envision merchant naval fishing and recreational vessels safely plying U S coastal waters electronically guided by space based navigation and advanced information technologies The new technologies will foster long term economic vitality natural resource management and pollution prevention While maritime commerce will always be hazardous the new technologies promise to significantly reduce the risk of accidents and spills footnote 1 Kite Powell H L Jin D Expected Safety Benefits and Costs of Electronic Chart Systems for Commercial Shipping in U S Waters A Working Draft June 1995 Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute co ops html CO OPS Homepage d ports html PORTS tp4days html Predictions data res html Water Level Obs bench html Benchmarks faq1 html Frequently Asked Questions usmap html Station Products pub html Publications opsdinf2 html CO OPS Info prodinfo html Product Info Revised April 1998
