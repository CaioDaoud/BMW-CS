the cohort in units of 15K will be named accordingly NIA 30K cDNA clone set etc and distributed as ready Distribution will take place to about 10 designated locations world wide The centers who receive sets of clones have agreed to redistribute them to at least 8 other groups end users on demand as a condition of acceptance These centers would have to notify us of redistributions but there is no requirement for our permission or approval End users are allowed to produce and distribute microarrays but are not permitted to redistribute the NIA 15K clone set The conditions for the distribution of the microarrays and or clone sets are as follows Distribution schedules will be determined by the centers and subsequent end users All centers and end users will be allowed to charge nominal fees in order to recover costs of materials shipping and handling Each center and end user should keep an updated record of who has received clone sets microarrays and should provide us a copy

be exerted on how the clones and microarrays are used However to ensure that data obtained with the clones are cumulative for all publicly available efforts the individual names of clones must be maintained in any report and in database entries It would also be preferable for the NIA set to be treated as such no clones should be substituted in the NIA array and when single or multiple clones are rearrayed with others they must retain their names and be credited to the NIA set Whenever clones are used in reports our original paper should be cited http lgsun grc nia nih gov cDNA keyprofile
