Deceiving Saddam Deceiving Saddam Was the New York Times an unwitting collaborator in Pentagon misdirection By Richard A Muller http www technologyreview com articles print version wo muller061303 asp Technology for Presidents June 13 2003 On Feb 2 2003 the New York Times and other papers leaked the Pentagon s plan for the imminent invasion of Iraq It called for unleashing 3 000 precision guided bombs and missiles in the first 48 hours of the opening air campaign an effort intended to stagger and isolate the Iraqi military and quickly pave the way for a ground attack to topple a government in shock some experimental weapons are expected to be used including high powered microwave weapons that could flash millions of watts of electricity to cripple Iraqi computers and equipment I was fascinated by the plans and horrified by the leak The Times had given away the most valuable information that Saddam Hussein could possibly want The Iraqis now knew how to prepare and they did that by hunkering down to counter the coming shock and awe They would fight the battle in same way the great boxer Muhammad Ali did as his career waned rope a dope absorbing blows until the tormenter grew tired Only it didn t happen After a small aerial attack on Baghdad that may or may not have killed Saddam the military thrust ground troops rapidly and deeply into Iraq The Iraqis were caught off guard as their southern oilfields were suddenly seized I sat mesmerized as CNN s live video carried me rapidly over kilometers of desert From the TV screen I could estimate the speed of the tanks and I could see that they would arrive in Nasiriyah within a few hours Saddam could see that too unless he had shielded his satellite TV dishes to prevent destruction from the threatened high powered microwave attack that never materialized But he couldn t get his troops to Nasiriyah in time to stop the Americans from taking a key and undefended bridge across the Euphrates Reporters asked Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld when the shock and awe would come Soon he replied Why had the military changed its battle plan they asked Because of the opportunity Pentagon briefers replied The putative decapitation had supposedly created disarray in the Iraqi military so a last minute change made sense I m skeptical of this explanation My guess is that the Pentagon just didn t want to admit that it had purposely leaked a discarded battle plan to the Times and that its publication had successfully tricked the Iraqis into preparing for the wrong attack The art of deception has a long history in war and has often proven as important as the size of a force its level of training and the state of its weaponry General Norman Schwarzkopf made good use of deception in Gulf War I According to Jon Latimer s fascinating 2001 book Deception in War Schwarzkopf s commanders used press briefings to describe in detail how amphibious landings would be managed giving the impression without directly lying that the invasion would come not by land but by sea Psychological Operations pamphlets put into bottles that floated to the enemy held shore had cartoons depicting a Tidal Wave of Marines Their nominal purpose was to intimidate the Iraqi troops their real purpose was subtly to confirm the mistaken belief that the main attack would be amphibious Then at the last moment 100 000 U S ground troops made a massive westward move covering 600 kilometers of territory that had been cleared of potential Bedouin spies Operation Hail Mary hit the Iraqis on their relatively unprotected western flank and then circled around to attack them from behind The art of deception in other venues is known as magic Its fundamental principle is misdirection A magician suddenly appears with much noise and fanfare in the rear of the auditorium While everyone turns his assistants walk an elephant into the previously empty cage on stage unnoticed by the distracted audience A fascinating example not mentioned in Latimer s book comes from the initial years of World War II Unbeknownst to the Germans or even to the Americans the British had made a working radar system that could alert them to Nazi airborne attacks As a result whenever and wherever enemy pilots reached the shores of England they were met by British airplanes The Germans concluded that the British had thousands of airplanes defending the coast when in fact there were only hundreds As a result of this deception Hitler held back the massive airborne attack that could have overwhelmed Britain early in the war Misdirection is most effective when it makes uses of the habits and prejudices of the intended victim To help keep radar secret and therefore far more potent the British spread a wonderful rumor They leaked word that their pilot s performance was enhanced by excellent night vision due in turn to a diet heavy in carrots Even though it was utter nonsense the story had the required verisimilitude since carrots are rich in Vitamin A and Vitamin A deficiency is a leading cause of a disease known as night blindness But the idea that extra doses of Vitamin A improve vision in healthy people is a myth one perpetuated by my own mother when I was a child and I suspect even by today s parents I have never seen this carrot deception story in print I learned it from Luis Alvarez who had invented a radar landing system and had traveled to Britain during the war to teach the airmen how to use it I later verified the story with R V Jones Churchill s chief science advisor during WWII when I had the opportunity to have dinner with him shortly before his death in 1997 Tom Nixon a professional magician friend of mine is invariably asked after his performance How did you do that Tom whispers in response Can you keep a secret The expectant reply is invariably Yes Tom then says with a smile So can I Every magician including amateurs such as me learns that when magic is explained it loses its magic When a spectator learns how easily he was fooled he feels foolish possibly disappointed and often annoyed In contrast magic unexplained can confer power Magicians have often worked their way to positions of great influence The Greek priestesses of Delphi employed numerous tricks and illusions now uncovered at the ruins of the Temple of Apollo that gave them enormous influence in the ancient world Magicians were high in the court of Pharaoh but they were defeated by the miracles magic of the Jewish leader Moses James Randi following in the tradition of Houdini exposed many religious charlatans who use magic tricks and phony healings to convince followers that donating money will give access to God The art of deception can amplify power and that is why its study is a key part of military training Did the Department of Defense deliberately deceive the New York Times Were the leaked invasion plans a purposeful misdirection If so don t expect the Pentagon to confess Such an admission would make the Times look foolish The admission might even tarnish the military victory given its quickness the public might feel that such lying even about war was unnecessary and unfair And candor now could make it tougher for the military to use similar deception in the future Richard A Muller a 1982 MacArthur Fellow is a physics professor at the University of California Berkeley where he teaches a course called Physics for Future Presidents Since 1972 he has been a Jason consultant on U S national security His historical novel The Sins of Jesus is about misdirection used 2000 years ago
