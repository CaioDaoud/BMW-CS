Budget Future Future Directions Training NIH Research Training Programs UGSP Programs for Undergraduate Students Predoc Programs for Predoctoral Students LRP Programs for Physicians and Postdoctoral Researchers Information Additional Information Overview The National Institutes of Health NIH one of the world s premier centers for biomedical research lies at the heart of Federal efforts to support and stimulate research aimed at improving health and fighting disease The mission of NIH is to uncover new knowledge that will lead to better health for everyone NIH works toward its mission by Conducting research in its own laboratories Supporting the research of scientists in universities medical schools hospitals and research institutions in the United States and throughout the world Training research investigators Promoting the communication of medical information and research findings NIH accomplishes its mission by conducting and funding both basic and clinical research Basic research involves the fundamental studies of molecules genes proteins cells tissues and organisms that lead to a better understanding of the workings of our natural world Basic research may not have an immediate payoff but it can help us understand the underlying principles of how biological systems function This sets the stage for later medical advances that depend on this basic understanding of biology Clinical research focuses on developing and testing new approaches to the prevention diagnosis and treatment of disease Together basic and clinical research are our most powerful weapons against disease and disability Approximately 10 percent of the NIH budget funds research conducted through the NIH Intramural Research Program The intramural program supports more than 2 000 research projects conducted by more than 4 000 doctoral level scientists at NIH NIH s main campus is located in Bethesda Maryland The intramural program also has laboratories at other locations in Maryland Frederick and Baltimore and in other States including the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences in Research Triangle Park North Carolina the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases Epidemiology and Clinical Research Branch in Phoenix Arizona and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Rocky Mountain Research Station in Hamilton Montana The bulk of the NIH budget approximately 82 percent is invested in the extramural program which supports research through grants and contracts at more than 2 000 research institutions throughout the United States and abroad The rewards of this investment have come in the form of scores of scientific discoveries that are already helping researchers and physicians better understand prevent and treat cancer diabetes heart disease and neurological disorders as well as AIDS and other infectious diseases A small sampling of some of the research advances made in recent years through the intramural program the extramural program and collaborative efforts is outlined below Recent Major Advances Human Genome In February 2001 scientists throughout the world achieved a monumental milestone they sequenced nearly all of the 3 billion or so base pairs that make up the human genome the DNA contained in all the human chromosomes in each cell of the human body This feat was achieved through the Human Genome Project an international consortium of scientists from the Unites States England Japan Germany France and China The researchers published a draft sequence of the human genome that represents an exact order of four nucleotide bases that comprise the base pairs within DNA The draft sequence represents more than 90 percent of the total human DNA sequence In addition to determining the sequence of the human genome the international consortium published a nearly complete physical map of the human genome The sequence reveals the order of bases along a DNA strand whereas the genome map shows the position of the genes within the genome The project turned up a few surprises For example scientists found that the human genome contains far fewer genes than previously predicted Instead of the 100 000 genes thought to exist the human genome contains only about 35 000 genes Researchers also found that the human genome contains much more junk than previously realized About half of the genome consists of stretches of DNA that do not code for any proteins The findings are already changing the face of genetics throughout the world For example tens of thousands of new genes have been identified from the human genome sequence including more than 30 genes that play a role in human disease Scientists are also using the information to examine patterns of genes expressed under certain conditions such as cancer With research contributions from both extramural and intramural scientists the Human Genome Project which was funded in large part by NIH completed the sequence and mapping of the entire human genome in 2003 Cancer DNA Microarray Technology Physicians treating cancer patients have long been baffled by a mystery of sorts Among patients who seem to have similar symptoms with the same type and stage of cancer some respond to standard therapies and are cured while others fail to respond and die But new research reveals that cancer cells that appear similar through a microscope may be quite different on a molecular level Researchers at NIH and their collaborators have recently developed a powerful technique that can distinguish between different types of closely related cancers The technique known as DNA microarray technology anchors thousands of specific known DNA sequences to a grid on a silicon microchip Researchers can then bind complementary sequences of unknown genes that are expressed in a cell or tissue to evaluate the pattern of gene expression from a patient s cells Different subtypes of cancers can have different patterns of gene activation that are characteristic of that cancer subtype Understanding these subtle differences may help physicians develop better ways to understand prevent and treat different cancers Breast Cancer Physicians treating patients with breast cancer have long sought a better way of distinguishing hereditary forms of breast cancer from sporadic forms of the disease Approximately 5 percent of women with breast cancer inherit genetic mutations that predispose them to the disease whereas women with sporadic breast cancer accumulate genetic changes over time that can eventually lead to cancer Hereditary breast cancers are often more aggressive affect women at younger ages and may require a different course of treatment Over the past decade researchers discovered that mutations in two genes BRCA1 and BRCA2 give rise to most cases of hereditary breast cancer However the genes are very large and it is difficult to pinpoint the genetic mutations that are triggering disease Researchers at NIH s National Human Genome Research Institute turned to DNA microarray technology to see if different types of breast cancer cells express different patterns of genes The researchers analyzed the expression of more than 6 000 genes from breast cancer cells and found clear differences between hereditary and nonhereditary breast tumors The researchers found that the pattern of genes activated was different among tumors with BRCA1 BRCA2 and sporadic mutations The researchers distinguished the three categories of tumors by analyzing 50 or 60 specific genes Understanding how the activation of these subsets of genes results in different paths of cancer development may help researchers develop new targets for treating and preventing breast cancer Childhood Cancers Physicians also have difficulty distinguishing four types of closely related childhood cancers neuroblastoma rhabdomyosarcoma non Hodgkin s lymphoma and Ewing s sarcoma Under the microscope cells from these four cancers appear very similar and are difficult to differentiate Because of their similarity these cancers are sometimes misdiagnosed and not treated appropriately Researchers at NIH collaborated with investigators in Sweden to study these cancer cells using DNA microarray technology They were able to distinguish the cancers from each other by analyzing the expression of a set of 93 genes Forty one of these genes were not previously known to be involved in the development of the cancers The researchers hope that studying these genes will help them better understand the biology of these cancers and possibly serve as targets for developing new cancer drugs Ovarian Cancer Early detection is a critical concern for treating women with ovarian cancer More than 80 percent of patients are not diagnosed until the cancer has progressed to later stages when they have a less than 20 percent chance of surviving for 5 years In contrast patients who are diagnosed at early stages have a 95 percent survival rate at 5 years NIH researchers and their collaborators have developed a new test that can detect ovarian cancer even at early stages The scientists combined another cutting edge technology called proteomics with sophisticated artificial intelligence computer programs Whereas gene chip technology assesses gene expression in cells proteomics examines cells for the presence of particular proteins The scientists used computers to study the patterns of proteins present in samples from known cancer patients then looked for these same patterns in unknown samples The test was able to correctly identify all samples from patients with stage I ovarian cancer The proteomic test can be used to detect ovarian cancer and potentially other cancers as well using a blood sample from a finger prick Researchers believe the technology will go a long way toward helping women combat this devastating disease Prostate Cancer Gene Discovered Approximately 16 percent of American men will develop prostate cancer sometime in their life Scientists have been searching for the genetic mutations that cause prostate cancer for several decades This year researchers at NIH and their collaborators discovered a new gene on chromosome 1 linked with an inherited form of prostate cancer The gene which codes for a protein called Ribonuclease L RNASEL is mutated in some families with a history of prostate cancer The RNASEL protein plays a role in targeting damaged or abnormal cells for programmed cell death The mutated cells may become cancerous when this normal way of ridding the body of damaged cells is inactivated RNASEL is probably just one of several proteins that contribute to prostate cancer Novel Anti Cancer Drug Discovered Until recently most cancer patients have had to endure painful rounds of chemotherapy drugs aimed at killing their cancer cells The problem with most chemotherapy drugs is that they also kill normal cells and cause debilitating side effects The strategy has been able to give enough drug to kill the cancer but not enough to kill the patient and hope that the cancer does not recur For years researchers have been searching for drugs that will specifically target cancer cells without harming normal cells or the patient In May 2001 the FDA approved the use of a member of a new class of anti cancer drug Gleevec to treat chronic myelogenous leukemia CML Gleevec produced dramatic results in an early phase clinical trial in which normal blood counts were restored in 53 out of 54 patients given the drug The drug developed by the pharmaceutical company Novartis is the first of a new generation of anti cancer drugs that specifically target a protein known to contribute to the development of cancer CML is caused by the translocation of a piece of chromosome 22 which fuses to chromosome 9 A gene called bcr is broken off of chromosome 22 and fused to a second gene called abl on chromosome 9 This fusion creates a new gene called bcr abl that codes for a protein that belongs to a class of proteins known as tyrosine kinases Tyrosine kinases play important roles in regulating cell growth but bcr abl causes cells to divide uncontrollably leading to leukemia Gleevec specifically blocks the action of the bcr abl protein in leukemia cells but does not affect normal cells In a recently completed Phase II study of Gleevec designed to test both the safety and the efficacy of the drug 454 patients with CML who had not responded to standard therapy took Gleevec on a daily basis After 18 months 95 percent of the patients were alive and 89 percent were free of disease progression NIH has funded much of the basic research that led to the discovery of Gleevec and is continuing to support and coordinate clinical trials of the drug Currently clinical trials are being held to test the long term effects of Gleevec in CML patients as well as the effect of Gleevec in patients with other types of cancer including glioblastomas and sarcomas AIDS Research HAART When AIDS first appeared in this country and throughout the world the disease was a virtual death sentence Although there is still no cure researchers have made great strides in developing treatment regimens to combat the devastating disease Over the past several years an AIDS treatment strategy called highly active anti retroviral therapy HAART has proven remarkably successful in reducing HIV levels and preventing the progression of AIDS in HIV infected patients Many patients have experienced a reduction in HIV to undetectable levels in the blood However the therapy which consists of combinations of three or four potent anti retroviral drugs can be toxic difficult to adhere to and prohibitively expensive NIH researchers recently studied the feasibility of cycling on and off these medications The researchers showed that this approach called structured intermittent therapy appeared to effectively control HIV replication while reducing some of the side effects of HAART The study involved 10 patients who had been receiving daily HAART During the study patients received a four drug regimen of the anti HIV drugs stavudine lamivudine indinavir and ritonavir administered twice a day for a period of 7 days followed by a 7 day period with no drugs This on off cycle was repeated 16 34 times or 32 to 68 weeks The researchers found that study patients had no significant increases in the amount of HIV in their bodies and no reduction in CD4 T cells important immune cells that are typically depleted in HIV infected patients The researchers also found that patients on structured intermittent therapy had reduced serum cholesterol and triglyceride levels Typically HAART therapy increases serum cholesterol and triglyceride levels which can contribute to heart problems in patients The success of the initial pilot study has prompted larger clinical trials of structured intermittent therapy The researchers hope that the approach could reduce the side effects and high costs of HAART which have impeded its widespread use particularly in underdeveloped nations where more than 95 percent of HIV infected individuals live HIV Vaccine Development As a result of new scientific findings and new funding in the area of HIV vaccines many new approaches are being pursued from the basic research level through vaccine product development In the past several years investigators have determined that several AIDS vaccine strategies have been able to decrease the level of the virus that was established shortly after challenge in animal models Even though these vaccines have not been totally effective in preventing virus infection the concept that control of viral load may be an equally important vaccine outcome has been recognized because of data that suggest that partners of HIV infected subjects become infected far less frequently when there is a reduced level of HIV transmission In November of 2002 NIH s Vaccine Research Center VRC launched a Phase I clinical study of a novel DNA vaccine directed at the three most globally important HIV subtypes or clades The vaccine developed by VRC incorporates HIV genetic material from clades A B and C which cause about 90 percent of all HIV infections around the world This is the first multigene multiclade HIV vaccine to enter human trials and marks an important milestone in the search for a single vaccine that targets U S subtypes of HIV as well as clades causing the global epidemic Reducing Mother to Child Transmission In 2002 alone approximately 800 000 children worldwide became infected with HIV through mother to child transmission with more than 90 percent residing in resource poor countries A regimen of the HIV drug AZT administered to the mother during labor and to the infant during the first week after birth reduces the infection rate but AZT is expensive and requires multiple doses due to its short half life A recent NIH funded study by Ugandan and U S researchers found that two doses of the inexpensive antiviral drug nevirapine NVP one dose to the mother and one to the child reduced HIV transmission by 41 percent over infants and mothers who received an AZT regimen At 18 months 25 8 percent of children in the AZT group were infected with HIV compared with 15 7 percent in the NVP group yielding a difference of 41 percent when a time variable is considered The cost savings of using nevirapine in the study were substantial approximately 70 times less than the AZT treatment Heart Disease The scientific mainstream has long believed that certain types of cells once destroyed are gone forever For decades physicians have been telling their patients that heart muscle damaged during a heart attack cannot be repaired or regenerated But two recent studies now challenge the longstanding dogma NIH funded researchers in collaboration with researchers at NIH in Bethesda discovered that bone marrow cells can develop into cardiomyocytes and replace damaged heart muscle in mice The researchers induced myocardial infarction or heart attack in mice by ligating or tying off the left main coronary artery a major blood vessel to the heart They then injected bone marrow cells into the wall bordering the damaged heart muscle The bone marrow cells were selectively enriched for a type of bone marrow progenitor cell with a high capacity to develop into a variety of cell types The researchers found that the injected cells homed in on the damaged tissue and regenerated new myocardium which occupied 68 percent of the damaged portion of the heart muscle 9 days after injection The results indicate that bone marrow progenitor cells can replace dead or damaged myocardial cells with functioning living tissue The results indicate that the heart is much more resilient than previously realized Diabetes Diabetes Prevention The Diabetes Prevention Program DPP a multi center study sponsored by NIH and conducted at clinics throughout the country ended a year early when it showed that lifestyle changes can delay and possibly prevent the onset of type 2 diabetes Seventeen million people in the United States have diabetes today Type 2 diabetes the most common form occurs mostly in people who are older overweight sedentary and have a family history of diabetes African Americans Latinos and Native Americans have an especially high risk of developing type 2 diabetes Diabetes greatly increases the risk of heart disease kidney disease stroke eye disease and nerve damage In fact it is the main cause of kidney failure limb amputation and new onset blindness and a main cause of heart disease and stroke Diabetes which is characterized by high blood glucose levels is usually preceded by pre diabetes People with pre diabetes have blood glucose levels that are higher than normal but not high enough to be considered diabetic Physicians and researchers have long known that regular exercise and changes in diet can lower blood glucose levels in people with diabetes The DPP asked whether modest weight loss achieved with these same lifestyle changes or a glucose lowering medication could delay or even prevent the onset of diabetes The researchers randomly assigned 3 234 overweight volunteers with pre diabetes to one of three groups Lifestyle modification through diet and exercise with the aim of reducing weight by 7 percent Treatment with the drug metformin an oral medication used to treat type 2 diabetes A control group receiving a placebo in place of metformin The results showed that people in the diet and exercise group who lost 5 7 percent of their weight lowered the incidence of diabetes by 58 percent Metformin reduced the incidence of diabetes by 30 percent Among volunteers over the age of 60 diet and exercise reduced the incidence of diabetes by 71 percent In addition to delaying or preventing the onset of diabetes diet and exercise also restored normal blood glucose levels in many people with pre diabetes The researchers plan to continue to monitor study participants to see whether diabetes can be delayed beyond the 3 year followup period in the study Islet Transplantation and Stem Cells Type 1 diabetes or juvenile onset diabetes results from the loss of the insulin producing islet cells of the pancreas For unknown reasons the body s immune system destroys its own islet cells and patients are unable to produce insulin Without insulin the cells of the body cannot function Researchers would like to find a way to replace the insulin producing cells of the pancreas in patients with type 1 diabetes They are finding new hope in islet transplantation Researchers are trying to determine whether the procedure can restore natural insulin production in patients with type 1 diabetes Despite its promise however islet transplantation cannot be adopted for widespread use until two major obstacles are overcome the severe shortage of donor islets and the need for immunomodulatory drugs that safely prevent rejection NIH is addressing the inadequate supply of islets by establishing a Beta Cell Consortium to pursue methods for growing an unlimited quantity of functional insulin secreting beta cells Studies on immune tolerance which would permit transplantation without the need for chronic immunosuppressive drugs are focusing on the problem of rejection of transplanted tissue In related work NIH is funding research resources such as islet isolation centers to obtain human islets from donor pancreases for use in islet transplantation studies as well as research to find ways to prevent the immune system from rejecting the transplanted islets Stem cell research may also provide methods for developing a renewable supply of islets Recently scientists at NIH induced mouse stem cells to develop into insulin producing islet clusters similar to those found in the pancreas The researchers started with embryonic stem cells of mice The stem cells spontaneously form aggregates called embryoid bodies which contain all three primordial germ layers The researchers then selected a subpopulation of cells that express a specific neural marker After subjecting the cells to a five stage culturing technique the cells formed islet like pancreatic clusters The cells responded to normal glucose concentrations by secreting insulin and survived when transplanted into mice Researchers hope that this technique may lead to a way to develop insulin producing cells for people with type 1 diabetes Neurological Disorders Spinal Cord Injury Each year approximately 100 000 Americans suffer an injury to the spinal cord often causing paralysis muscle atrophy breathing difficulties and chronic pain An estimated 200 000 individuals in the United States live day to day with the devastating consequences of such injuries Recently NIH supported researchers found that delayed treatment of spinal cord injury may improve recovery In the study rats given an experimental combination therapy consisting of fetal spinal tissue transplants and nerve growth factors neurotrophins several weeks after their spinal cords were severed showed dramatically greater re growth of nerve fibers and recovery of function than rats treated immediately after injury The finding suggests that the window of opportunity for treating spinal cord injury may be wider than previously anticipated Earlier studies in animals have shown that fetal tissue transplants and neurotrophins can improve re growth of injured neurons in the adult spinal cord and that some injured neurons can re grow even after long periods of time However this study is the first to show that spinal cord regeneration is actually improved when treatment is postponed until most of the initial injury related changes in the rat spinal cord have taken place and the surrounding environment has stabilized Translational Research The Neurodegeneration Drug Screening Consortium a novel partnership between the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke and three voluntary health organizations was created to identify drugs that may be useful for treating neurodegenerative disorders Recently the group met to discuss results of the initial phase of the program a large scale 6 month project in which investigators from 26 laboratories tested 1 040 compounds They used 29 different assays to identify possible effects of the drugs on cell death protein aggregation and other processes linked to neurodegenerative diseases Most of the tested compounds had previously been approved by the FDA for use in treating other disorders FDA approved drugs generally have advantages over newly identified compounds because they are already on the market and have undergone years of testing in humans More research is needed before the tested compounds can be considered for clinical trials in patients with neurodegenerative disorders Muscular Dystrophy In a recent NIH supported study scientists identified a new kind of genetic problem that underlies a common neuromuscular disorder called facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy FSHD The study showed that deletion of repetitive DNA sequences in people with FSHD causes overactivity in nearby genes The finding solves a decades old mystery about the causes of this disorder and may ultimately lead to the first effective treatments The researchers found that abnormally short strings of repeated DNA sequences on chromosome 4 interfere with the function of a protein complex that controls nearby genes leading to overactivity of several genes that may play a role in FSHD This type of genetic problem has never before been identified in a human disease FSHD is the third most common inherited neuromuscular disorder affecting one in every 20 000 people Symptoms include progressive muscle degeneration that primarily affects the face shoulder blades and upper arms Despite intensive efforts researchers have been unable to identify any genes that are altered in this disorder Scientists can now focus on identifying which genes on chromosome 4 contribute to FSHD and how to regulate gene activity Deafness Gene Discovered NIH researchers in collaboration with 21 other scientists in this country Pakistan and India have discovered a gene that when mutated causes two forms of deafness in both humans and mice The gene called TMC1 for transmembrane cochlear expressed gene is located on chromosome 9 in humans and codes for a protein that is thought to affect the function of cochlear hair cells Hair cells convert sound vibrations into electrical signals that are transmitted to the brain One type of dominant hearing loss called DFNA36 develops when one parent passes along a dominant mutation of TMC1 Although the child will have normal hearing early on severe deafness will generally occur by the age of 30 A recessive form of deafness called DFNB B11 appears to be caused by a different mutation of TMC1 A child who inherits two copies of the recessive mutation will be deaf at birth However carriers with only one recessive mutation of TMC1 have normal hearing The researchers also reported that in mice a similar gene Tmc1 is located on chromosome 19 Mice with a recessive form of the mutant gene are profoundly deaf and their cochlear hair cells do not respond to sound The findings suggest that the protein encoded for by TMC1 in humans and Tmc1 in mice plays an important role in the function of cochlear hair cells By identifying the role of this protein researchers can better understand the hearing process and why some inherited hearing disorders arise Biodefense and Anthrax The terror and fear felt by all Americans following September 11 2001 has been devastating The incidents of anthrax poisoning that followed raised the specter that the threat of bioterrorism is more real than perhaps anyone ever realized The attacks have underscored the importance of understanding the mode of action of anthrax and other agents of bioterrorism Two teams of NIH funded researchers recently reported key discoveries that shed light on how the anthrax toxin destroys cells often killing its victims In the most dangerous form of anthrax poisoning inhalation anthrax bacterial spores are inhaled and travel to the lungs where they multiply and produce a lethal toxin The anthrax toxin has three parts Protective antigen PA binds to a receptor on the surface of cells and ushers edema factor EF and lethal factor LF into the cells of the host Once inside the cell edema factor and lethal factor interfere with cell metabolism ultimately leading to cellular destruction In the recent studies researchers discovered that the first step in the attack of the anthrax toxin occurs when PA binds to a protein on the surface of animal cells that appears to be the anthrax toxin receptor ATR The researchers identified the specific portion of the receptor protein that binds to the toxin Then they manufactured a truncated synthetic version of that part of the receptor the toxin binding domain that binds to the anthrax toxin When they mixed the receptor fragment with the anthrax toxin the fragment blocked binding of anthrax to its receptor This approach suggests a plausible route to developing antidotes to the anthrax toxin Benefits of Biomedical Research NIH invests its research dollars with the ultimate goal of preventing and treating disease and disability This investment has benefited Americans by saving lives improving the quality of life and reducing the costs of health care and lost income due to disability Research Saves Lives Over the past several decades biomedical research has led to countless improvements in the health of the Nation Heart disease Although heart disease is still the number one killer in the United States the heart disease death rate number of deaths per 100 000 people dropped by 36 percent between 1977 and 1999 Stroke The death rate due to stroke decreased by 50 percent between 1977 and 1999 And anti clotting medications have cut the risk of stroke due to atrial fibrillation a common heart condition by 80 percent Cancer Advances in understanding the genetic and environmental causes of cancer have led to effective screening programs that prevent cancer improve detection and increase the success of treatments Between 1992 and 1998 the overall incidence of cancer fell 1 1 percent each year The number of deaths due to cancer also fell 1 1 percent per year during the same period Mental Illness New treatments for schizophrenia can reduce or eliminate the symptoms of schizophrenia including hallucinations and delusions in 80 percent of patients Spinal Cord Injury High doses of steroid given within the first 8 hours after injury can prevent paralysis and increase the likelihood of recovery in patients who have lost sensation or mobility Diabetes Maintaining tight control of blood glucose levels blood pressure and LDL bad cholesterol in people with diabetes with the help of new medications can lower the risk of debilitating complications of diabetes including heart disease stroke nerve disease eye disease and kidney disease by more than 50 percent Respiratory distress syndrome Infant mortality due to respiratory distress syndrome a condition caused by immaturity of the lungs has decreased significantly due to the development of a new treatment lung surfactant that prevents lung collapse in premature infants Infectious diseases Vaccines now prevent diseases that once killed and disabled millions of children and adults Life Expectancy In general an infant born today can expect to live three decades longer than one born at the turn of the last century Research Saves Money Not only does biomedical research save lives it also reduces the costs of health care and the impact of lost earnings For example estrogen therapy can reduce the incidence of osteoporosis and hip fractures in postmenopausal women for an estimated annual savings of 333 million in patient care costs Men with testicular cancer can now expect a 91 percent cure rate and an increased life expectancy of 40 years Thus a 17 year 56 million investment in research on testicular cancer has led to an annual savings of 166 million The NIH Budget NIH s important role in the Nation s biomedical research enterprise is reflected in the proposed fiscal year 2004 budget of 27 8 billion In 2003 Congress appropriated 27 2 billion to NIH which supported nearly 46 700 research project grants in universities medical schools and independent research institutions across the country Several biomedical research priority areas were identified in the President s proposed NIH fiscal year 2003 budget They included Investigator Initiated Research 15 2 billion for new competing and continuing grants to fund research projects initiated by individual investigators Cancer Research 5 5 billion for cancer related research Of particular interest is the use of proteomics and sophisticated computer technology to detect and diagnose cancers and new drugs that specifically target proteins known to arise from genetic mutations that lead to cancer Biodefense Research An increase by 1 47 billion to 1 75 billion for biodefense research Most of this money was targeted to expand the effort to develop countermeasures that will be needed to respond to bioterrorism attacks Clinical Research NIH hopes to benefit from unprecedented advances in genomics proteomics and advanced imaging technology to test new ways to prevent diagnose and treat many diseases through clinical trials involving patients and healthy volunteers The fiscal year 2003 budget placed particular emphasis on clinical research For example funds for the Extramural Loan Repayment Program for Clinical Researchers doubled to approximately 50 million over the previous year s request Research on Disease Prevention More than 6 8 billion to launch new initiatives to develop strategies to prevent disease The cornerstone of disease prevention remains vaccine development New vaccines to prevent otitis media Ebola HIV AIDS Leishmania and malaria will be pursued Diabetes More than 845 million to support research into the treatment and prevention of diabetes a chronic disease that affects more than 17 million people in the United States today Research into preventing type 2 diabetes through changing lifestyle factors as well as developing technology for islet cell transplantation to treat patients with type 1 diabetes will be emphasized Minority Health and Health Disparities NIH remains committed to eliminating disparities in health among minorities and other disadvantaged populations The proposed budget will support improvements to infrastructure in minority institutions and foster partnerships with minority research institutions In 2000 Congress authorized the establishment of the National Center on Minority Health and Health Disparities which aims to promote minority health and to lead the NIH effort to reduce and ultimately eliminate health disparities Parkinson s Disease NIH will continue to fund research to treat Parkinson s disease based on advances in understanding the genetics cell biology and pharmacology of the disease Methods for replacing damaged dopamine releasing neurons as well as testing neuroprotectant drugs which slow progression of the disease will be actively investigated The 215 million budget for this disease seeks to carry out the NIH Parkinson s Disease Research Agenda the result of a 2000 workshop attended by patients doctors and scientists from academia government and industry Future Directions Although NIH supported scientists have made many important discoveries in recent years much remains to be done Researchers are trying to find better ways to prevent and treat a wide range of diseases including brain disorders diabetes cardiovascular disease asthma childhood diseases and those associated with aging Efforts to understand how organisms function under normal and abnormal conditions will lead to biomedical research advances that result in improved health for all Americans and for people worldwide In September 2003 NIH Director Elias A Zerhouni M D announced a series of far reaching initiatives known collectively as the NIH Roadmap for Medical Research The Roadmap aims to transform the Nation s medical research capabilities and accelerate medical discoveries to improve health In setting forth an ambitious vision for a more efficient and productive system of medical research the NIH Roadmap focuses on the most compelling opportunities in three main areas new pathways to discovery research teams of the future and re engineering the clinical research enterprise NIH Research Training Programs Programs for Undergraduate Students Undergraduate Scholarship Program UGSP The
