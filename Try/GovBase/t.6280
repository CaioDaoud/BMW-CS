National Labs to Collaborate on Science and Technology initiatives collaborate shtml Announcement Collaboration between the INEEL and other DOE laboratories and sites provides significantly enhanced complexwide capabilities to support DOE s strategic objectives In response to new opportunities and continuing technical challenges the INEEL is seeking the most effective teams to solve problems Research and Development and operations collaborations among DOE laboratories and sites often lead to much broader collaborations with other federal agencies universities private companies and foreign organizations In addition to R D and operations collaborations the INEEL works with other DOE laboratories to improve business and operations practices Current activities include improved integration of the laboratories into DOE strategic planning consistent incorporation of performance based management principles into the contracts between DOE and laboratory operators and more effective communication of the laboratories accomplishments and their value Below summarizes examples of the INEEL s more notable direct R D and operations collaborations and how they support DOE missions As a inra managing partner in the INEEL the Inland Northwest Research Alliance x web other framed shtml http www inra org INRA plays a strategic role in the education and research decisions at the laboratory The mission of INRA at the INEEL is a to build successful multidisciplinary research and education programs b collaboratively compete for new research funding and c facilitate the development of associated programs at the INRA institutions Additionally the INEEL partners with other DOE laboratories as summarized below Environmental Quality Waste Management Hanford Site National Energy Technology Lab Oak Ridge Pacific Northwest National Laboratory Sandia Savannah River Site West Valley Demonstration Project Provide program planning operations and integration services Perform applied research and technology development for high priority needs in high mixed and low level waste management programs Results from these activities support DOE Environmental Quality objectives to safely manage nuclear materials and permanently dispose of radioactive wastes Environmental Restoration Hanford Site National Energy Technology Lab Pacific Northwest National Laboratory Sandia Savannah River Site Provide program planning operations and integration services Perform applied research and technology development demonstrations and deployments for high priority needs in
