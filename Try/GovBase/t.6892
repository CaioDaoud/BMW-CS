availability time table FAQs Q I hear that polar won t be around much longer What is its future and its replacement A A machine named polar is expected to be around for some time to come What hardware stands behind that name can be expected to change as has already happened 3 times in the history of the name Q If polar is having problems is there somewhere else I can go for the information A As we

product availability and distribution methods mmab mailing html Signing up for the mailing list is your surest method We will also update this notice and make note on the branch main page Q Followup question how can I find out about planned outages say to upgrade the hardware A Same as above We perform our upgrades in such a way that it almost never requires the system to be unavailable to users When such an event is planned we will announce it Q I couldn t get anything from the evening of January 3 to the morning of January 6 What happened A This was our worst case scenario Polar had a hardware failure on Friday evening This is a rare event with the last occurrence being a year earlier One wonders if polar is partying too much at the new year Q I also couldn t get much on January 25th What then A You were apparently affected by collateral damage to the Internet from the Sapphire or SQL Slammer worm Q Why is polar now refusing ftp connections to me A This is never a decision of not releasing the data It can be however that your system or a firewall your system uses is refusing to identify itself If identity cannot be confirmed ftp sessions to polar are not permitted Q My access to ftp polar ncep noaa gov has been slow lately why and is there anything I can do about it A1 Some people find better success with using the address polar wwb noaa gov instead This is surprising as the same system is being referenced but it s worth a try As is the converse if you ve been having problems on polar wwb noaa gov A2 Some changes in response time are unavoidable contention from Internet use to our building or of polar itself Both are upgraded periodically A3 See also the best response notes on best ftp usage below Notes for best response Open only 1 connection at a time Some ftp software command line ftp from Windows 98 and XP is known to have this problem produces failures if you attempt to open multiple connections Even if this isn t the case there is finite bandwidth to polar and by opening multiple connections you slow the transfer rate to yourself Retrieve data only after it can be expected to be updated see the Produce Suites table below for times in UTC equivalent to GMT Eastern Standard Time is 5 hours earlier Eastern Daylight Time is 4 hours earlier So 00 UTC is 7 PM EST and 8 PM EDT This will prevent a need for multiple transfers Please note that the availability times are approximate and delays of minutes to half an hour are not uncommon Delays over an hour are rare Retrieve the smallest data files that serve your needs If for example you are only interested in significant wave heights for the Western North Atlantic ocean it is most efficient to retrieve wna HTSGW grb at 2 1 Mbytes rather than all fields for that domain 29 4 Mb Only you can judge what best fills your needs Product Availability Time Table Times in the table are approximate times of availability in UTC Eastern Standard Time is 5 hours
