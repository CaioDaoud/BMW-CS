JPL SCIGN Analysis SCIGN Analysis Jet Propulsion Laboratory Last updated on Mon Dec 8 22 00 08 PST 2003 Number of hits 89 Insert Hector Here The Southern California Integrated GPS Network http www scign org SCIGN is a collaborative project to install 250 permanent continuously recording Global Positioning System GPS receivers in and around the Los Angeles basin to provide accurate deformation information that will improve our estimates of earthquake hazards Major participants in SCIGN include NASA JPL The United States Geological Survey USGS and The University of California San Diego operating under the umbrella of the Southern California Earthquake Center SCEC Chief sponsors of the SCIGN network are the W M Keck Foundation The National Science Foundation NASA and the USGS Currently SCIGN is in the process of identifying and selecting candidate sites for installation based on the DOTS3 map For a more detailed map of the station distribution click scign dots3 3 big jpg here Current Status of SCIGN Information is available on the site status data quality engineering data from analyses at JPL using GIPSY and time series of station coordinates Status Each station is assigned a composite score based on data quantity quality and latency Select ftp igscb jpl nasa gov igscb data network igsnet doc documentation for detailed information on how these are computed Green indicates a composite score of 8 or more and red 5 or less Sites with intermediate values are indicated with yellow Blue indicates that although data were available at one or more Global Data Centers they were not successfully processed at JPL in time for the report The score reflects a moving 7 day average Engineering Plots and statistics are available for the time series of station performance for each day analyzed by the JPL quick look process These statistics include for daily mean values for the phase residuals mm pseudorange residuals cm clock ns number of epochs processed number of phase breaks detected the number of days processed and days since the last day processed Tables are available for the http milhouse jpl nasa gov eng eng html global network and for http milhouse jpl nasa gov eng scign html SCIGN Time Series Given 24 hours of GPS data the latitude longitude and height of each receiver can be computed to within a few mm Time series graphically illustrate the evolution of receiver positions from day to day A global reference frame called ITRF96 is used for all time series Each plot includes the estimated positions with error bars the best fit line and the residual scatter which is an indication of the daily measurement precision The motion of each site is due to a combination of inter seismic co seismic and post seismic effects Time series are also available for http milhouse jpl nasa gov series html all global network site s Educational Page To learn more about educational activities related to SCIGN please visit SCEC s SCIGN Educational Module
