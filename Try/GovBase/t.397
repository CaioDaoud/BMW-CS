Statement Page Information About The Satellite Services Division NOAA NESDIS OSDPD SSD The Satellite Services Division SSD is part of the Office of Satellite Data Processing and Distribution OSDPD We SSD and OSDPD are part of National Environmental Satellite Data and Information Service NESDIS NESDIS is part of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration NOAA and the Department of Commerce Currently the Satellite Services Division is composed of two Branches Satellite Analysis Branch SAB and Interactive Processing Branch IPB At this web site you will find information and links to SSD products and services in support of the NOAA mission to provide support to the public in the form of satellite imagery and derived satellite products Here are brief mission statements for SSD SAB and IPB EC2000 SATELLITE SERVICES DIVISION E SP2 Reginald Lawrence Division Chief The Satellite Services Division serves as the primary interface with the user community of environmental satellite data and products The Division provides data analyses and interpretations from polar orbiting and geostationary satellites These satellite products are distributed to a diverse user community for a broad range of environmental applications The Division maintains an operational satellite data distribution network providing user access to real time or near real time environmental data and information A quality assurance program is used to systematically evaluate and manage the satellite products and services Working with other organizations within NESDIS and NOAA new products are tested evaluated and implemented when deemed operationally useful In partnership with other agencies the Division evaluates and deploys new technologies to satisfy emerging requirements http www ssd noaa gov SSD

The Interactive Processing Branch utilizes interactive processing technology to operationally support products derived from satellite based remote sensors The Branch serves as the NESDIS focal point for the development and implementation of interactive workstation technology image processing capabilities geographic information systems and telecommunications networks used for operational applications of environmental satellite data The Branch provides services in the applications of interactive image and graphics processing and the integration of interactive image processing capabilities into centralized regional and local analysis systems The Branch provides general day to day management for the Interactive Processing Center including oversight of system and physical configuration scheduling and monitoring facility utilization proposing resource support for the upkeep and growth and the integration of telecommunications networks The Branch also supports requests for short term special events using this technology http www ssd noaa gov IPB orgchart jpg IPB Organizational Chart EC2300 SATELLITE ANALYSIS BRANCH E SP23 George Serafino Branch Chief Satellite Analysis Branch serves as the operational focal point for real time imagery products and multi disciplinary environmental analyses within NOAA s National Environmental Satellite Data and Information Service NESDIS The Branch s primary mission is to support disaster mitigation and warning services for U S Federal agencies and the international community Routine environmental analyses are provided to forecasters and the numerical models of the National Weather Service and to oceanographic and other environmental users The Branch schedules and distributes real time satellite imagery products
