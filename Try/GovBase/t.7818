systems and clusters Our goal is to drastically improve the way clusters are built managed and used Objective Our approach is to subtract rather than add to existing software and to replace artifacts from desktop computing Research and Development Areas We call our new cluster architecture a Science Appliance Our software suite is called Clustermatic Science Appliance tools enable node boot in under 10 seconds LinuxBIOS cluster boot and upgrade in under 2 minutes LinuxBIOS BProc manageble nodes from power on LinuxBIOS BProc single system image of the entire cluster BProc fast process migration BProc fast cluster monitoring Supermon In the News http www fcw com fcw articles 2003 0825 tec lightning 08 25 03 asp ASCI Lightning to will run Clustermatic software The Cluster Research
