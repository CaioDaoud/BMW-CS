Missouri River InfoLINK The InfoLINK is as an Internet based Missouri River information clearinghouse It is a multi year project initiated in 1998 by a partnership of Federal agencies The Missouri River drains one sixth of the nation and management decisions affect a wide range of Americans from Montana to Missouri who represent diverse river interests The InfoLINK was created for these stakeholders who want to understand how the river functions and make informed decisions about the river s future use and management The InfoLINK seeks to be a center point for common ground uniting interests through information sharing that facilitates communication among all of the basin s citizens Biomonitoring of Environmental Status and Trends Program BEST The Biomonitoring of Environmental Status and Trends http www best usgs gov BEST Program was initiated in part as a revision and expansion of the National Contaminant Biomonitoring Program NCBP One aspect of the BEST program focuses on monitoring contaminants and effects across broad geographic areas This approach is currently being evaluated in the Mississippi Columbia Rio Grande and Yukon River basins The overall objectives of the BEST program are to describe the occurrence and distribution of contaminants and their effects on fish in large US river basins to quantitatively evaluate the performance of aquatic methods used by the BEST program and to evaluate potential collaborations with the National Stream Quality Accounting Network http water usgs gov nasqan NASQAN and the National Water Quality Assessment http water

basin The primary species targeted at each site were common carp Cyprinus carpio and largemouth bass Micropterus salmoides in the Mississippi Columbia and Rio Grande River basins and longnose suckers Catostomidae and northern pike Esox lucius in the Yukon River basin other species mostly other black basses Micropterus spp percids Stizostedion spp salmonids suckers Catostomidae and catfish Ictaluridae were collected as alternates depending on habitat and location Individual fish about 40 per station were analyzed for reproductive biomarkers vitellogenin and sex steroid hormones

deformities and parasites Organochlorine pesticides and total PCB s and elemental heavy metals and metalloids contaminant analyses and the H4IIE bioassay for dioxin like activity were performed on

Contaminants and their Effects in Aquatic Ecosystems 1 2MB ncbp ncbp html NCBP Data National Contaminant Biomonitoring Program The National Contaminant Biomonitoring Program NCBP was established to document trends in the occurrence of persistent toxic chemicals that may threaten fish and wildlife resources Begun in the early 1960s as part of the National Pesticide Monitoring Program the NCBP has expanded its initial focus on persistent organochlorine insecticides to include industrial chemicals herbicides and potentially toxic elemental contaminants The program also provides necessary feedback to the regulatory process by documenting the success or failure of regulatory actions related to environmental contaminants The NCBP provides a nationwide source of material that is searched analytically for the occurrence of new or previously undetected environmental contaminants to provide information on emerging problems and for the development of new and improved analytical methods Through its archival function the NCBP also provides a means for retrospective analyses and documentation of historical trends for newly identified environmental contaminants Information from this historical program has also provided an impetus for developing a revised and expanded monitoring program Biomonitoring of Environmental Status and Trends BEST which was transferred to USGS in 1996
