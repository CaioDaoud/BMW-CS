Proposals will be accepted for the next operating cycle January through June 2004 fast shtml Fast Access Proposals The IPNS Research Proposal form PropForm0801 is now available for downloading via ftp at the address houdini pns anl gov in the PUB Forms folder It is available in MS Word Format and Adobe Acrobat Format The proposal form can also be downloaded via the IPNS web site at http www pns anl gov The Program Advisory Committee will review only those proposals submitted on the proposal form dated 08 01 Please delete all previously dated forms you may have downloaded The proposal form is an important input to the Committee for allocation of beam time When completing the proposal form Be as comprehensive as possible use of figures is extremely useful to the Committee Limit your information to the available space on the proposal form Indicate desired and impossible dates Include your E mail address in the space provided Safety and sample information is VERY important please be sure to notify us of hazards Attachments to e mail messages are preferred and will be accepted as original documents If submitting by e mail send to mailto cpeters anl gov cpeters anl gov or mail FAX to IPNS Scientific Secretary Building 360 Argonne National Laboratory Argonne IL 60439 4814 Phone 630 252 7820 FAX 630 252 7722 Those who have already run experiments must submit an experiment report on the standard IPNS Experimental Report Form ExpRpt99 in the PUB Forms folder at merlin pns anl gov or via the IPNS web site at http www pns anl gov http www pns anl gov Further beam time will not be granted unless reports on all previous experiments have been submitted Referencing and discussing all previous work at IPNS is extremely useful to the Program Advisory Committee and can enhance your proposal s prospects for acceptance Experimental reports will also be accepted by e mail forms shtml Research Proposals and Experimental Reports Proposals will be accepted for the following instruments Special Environment General Purpose High Intensity Powder Diffractometers SEPD GPPD HIPD Single Crystal Diffractometer SCD Small Angle Neutron Diffractometers SAD SAND Low Resolution High Resolution Medium Energy Chopper Spectrometers LRMECS HRMECS Polarized Neutron Reflectometer POSY Neutron Reflectometer POSY II Glass Liquid and Amorphous Materials Diffractometer GLAD Quasielastic Neutron Spectrometer QENS Some important parameters relating to instrument performance are shown in the following table User instruments are scheduled up to 75 of their time for users Additional information about any of the instruments may be obtained from the Instrument Scientists whose names are listed in the table and from the IPNS Home Page link to instruments Assistance for University Users of IPNS The University of Chicago Board of Governors for Argonne National Laboratory has supplied a car which is available for IPNS users during their stay Partial support for travel or living expenses is available to users from North American universities User Liaison Brent Heuser at the University of Illinois mailto bheuser uiuc edu bheuser uiuc edu is the IPNS User Liaison and will pass along user issues or concerns Purchase of Proprietary Beam Time Beam time for experiments can be purchased under a rate structure approved by the Department of Energy DOE For proprietary work or publishable work that is not of direct interest to the DOE the full cost recovery rate of 5000 Instrument day effective October 2001 will be applicable For information contact the IPNS Division
