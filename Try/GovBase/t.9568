conference call on Friday March 28 2003 to make recommendations to CDC regarding cases of cardiac adverse events that have been reported following smallpox vaccination A participants list of participants appears at the bottom of this page The specific questions that the Committee was asked to address were While more information is gathered are there levels and types of cardiac related conditions that should be added to the list of reasons for pre event smallpox vaccine medical deferral If so what are the specific pragmatic and feasible methods to screen for these conditions in the vaccine clinic setting What additional specific operational policy or research investigation advice can the Committee provide to move us forward Is special follow up required for persons with cardiovascular risk factors who have been recently vaccinated Ten cases of myopericarditis have been reported among several hundred thousand members of the military and two such cases one of myocarditis and one of pericarditis have been reported among civilian vaccinees Additionally CDC has received reports of 5 patients with cardiac ischemic events following smallpox vaccination including 3 patients with myocardial infarctions and two patients with angina Two of the persons with heart attacks have died These cases were reported this week in the MMWR Options considered by the Committee included Exclusion of persons with known underlying heart disease with or without symptoms In addition to exclusion of persons with known underlying heart disease exclude those with 3 or more major cardiac risk factors In addition to exclusion of persons with known underlying heart disease and three or more risk factors exclude persons 50 years of age and older The Committee recommended that CDC exclude persons with known underlying heart disease and persons with 3 or more major cardiac risk factors option 2 Draft screening questions were presented to the Committee and will be further reviewed with cardiologists and finalized early next week The Committee approved CDC s proposed research and did not recommend that special medical follow up was needed for persons with cardiovascular risk factors who had been vaccinated However persons who have received the smallpox vaccine should see a health care provider right away if they develop shortness of breath chest pain or other symptoms of cardiac disease Persons who have been diagnosed by a physician as having heart disease and have questions should contact their heart disease specialist or regular health care provider All people with heart disease or risk factors should receive the routine care recommended for persons with these conditions The ACIP is an advisory committee of the Centers for Disease
