Nonindigenous Aquatic Plant Distribution Information http www usgs gov usgs logo file nas htm Nonindigenous Aquatic Plant Distribution Information Aquatic vascular plants include the ferns and flowering plants that grow submersed in water float on the water surface or have basal portions inundated with foliage and upper parts emersed Diverse in form and habit many aquatic species have become established in the United States outside of their natural range Introduced intentionally or escaping from cultivation nonindigenous plants can colonize aquatic communities where they compete with and often displace native species Hydrilla Hydrilla verticillata water hyacinth Eichhornia crassipes and Eurasian watermilfoil Myriophyllum spicatum are examples well known for their ability to alter physical and biological functions of aquatic systems Data queries and maps at this website present distribution according to drainage in an effort to correlate aquatic species locality data with natural drainage systems We follow a system of drainage classification developed by the USGS Referred to as Hydrologic Unit Codes HUC this system identifies hydrologic regions of the US at four levels Our maps employ the 2 digit HUC 2 6 digit HUC 6 and 8 digit HUC 8 levels Mapping in this manner indicates recorded presence of a species from at least one location within a designated drainage but does not necessarily imply occurrence throughout that drainage This site is a work in progress We welcome any contributions or mailto Colette Jacono usgs gov comments you may have reportcol html Submit a Sighting Data Queries queries plants PlantTextSearch asp Plant Name queries plants PlantState html State Search queries plants PlantState html State queries plants planthuc6 us html Minor Drainage Search HUC6 queries plants planthuc6 us html Drainage HUC 6 sp accnts html Distribution Maps Species Accounts http salvinia er usgs gov Salvinia News Duck lettuce docs ottelia alsimoides htm Ottelia alismoides information and US distribution map docs cryp beckettii htm Cryptocoryne found in the Guadalupe River Texas Hydrilla docs hy verti html Hydrilla verticillata found in New Jersey Deeprooted Sedge docs sedge 20flyer3 31 03 pdf Cyperus entrerianus An Overlooked Aggressive Weed in the Southeastern United States pdf poster Eurasian water milfoil docs my spica html Myriophyllum spicatum new US distribution HUC map Hydrilla docs hy verti html Hydrilla verticillata now in Maine http www state me us dep blwq topic invasives hy1 htm ME DEP Hydrilla Report ID ALERT Marsh sowthistle Sonchus palustris present in Canada not known to occur in the United States Poster and information compliments of Stephen Darbyshire Agriculture and Agri Food Canada download printable Sonchus poster docs Sonchus palustris lq jpg JPG 201 kb docs Sonchus palustris jpg JPG 723 kb Roundleaf toothcup http www fcsc usgs gov Nonindigenous Species Rotala rotundifolia rotala rotundifolia html Rotala rotundifolia new to Florida and Alabama Asian Marshweed docs li sessi html Limnophila sessiliflora found in Sheldon Reservoir and Lake Houston Texas European frog bit docs hy morsu html Hydrocharis morsus ranae established in Washington Floating Hearts Nymphoides cristata Nymphoides indica spreading in Florida download printable flyer to http www fcsc usgs gov nymphoides pdf Know Nymphoides Mudmat http www fcsc usgs gov Nonindigenous Species Glossostigma diandrum glossostigma diandrum html Glossostigma diandrum in the Mid Atlantic Water clover plants docs marsilea marsilea html Marsilea in the South Wright s nut rush http www fcsc usgs gov Nonindigenous Species Scleria lacustris scleria lacustris html Scleria lacustris in Florida Photo upper right hand Eichhornia crassipes This page is maintained by the http cars er usgs gov Center for Aquatic Resource Studies The Center is part of the http biology usgs gov Biological Resources Division of the http www usgs gov United States Geological Survey under the http www doi gov Department of the Interior 21 November 2003 Return to the main page
