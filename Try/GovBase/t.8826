More Ice Slurry Heart Treatment A promising new approach to saving cardiac arrest victims injecting them with an ice slurry is being expanded under a new grant from the National Institutes of Health In collaboration with the University of Chicago s Emergency Resuscitation Research Center we will develop ways to use the high fluidity ice particle mixture for rapid cooling of the blood to sustain the heart and brain cells after cardiac arrests http www anl gov OPA logos21 1 ice01 htm More New ceramic sealant for drilling and completion of boreholes There is an urgent need for an effective sealant to be used in drilling and completion of boreholes under difficult downhole conditions of interest to the petroleum industry The chemically bonded phosphate ceramic developed in ET may meet this need because of its ability to bond tightly to earth materials and casing in the presence of drilling fluids or hydrocarbons http 132 175 127 176 ngotp news features issue 19 issue 19 cfm More
