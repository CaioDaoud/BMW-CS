Microsoft Word Contamination potentional of bedrock aquifers in Black Hills area http www usgs gov USGS Visual Identity CONCEPTS FOR STUDY OF THE CONTAMINATION POTENTIAL OF BEDROCK AQUIFERS IN THE BLACK HILLS AREA WESTERN SOUTH DAKOTA Bedrock aquifers are the primary source of drinking water in the Black Hills area of western South Dakota Large secondary porosity and permeability from fracturing or solution enhancement can allow extremely rapid infiltration of recharge with very little filtering of potential contaminants Extensive development that is occurring in recharge areas has potential for introduction of contaminants Contamination of bedrock aquifers could impair the quality of water supplies for a large part of the population in the Black Hills or require investment in expensive water treatment facilities Conversely limiting growth and development in recharge areas also has substantial economic implications Thus information regarding the contamination potential of bedrock aquifers in the Black Hills area would be extremely useful for a variety of water resource managers and land use planners The U S Geological Survey has prepared a preliminary concept paper that identifies possible approaches for evaluating the potential for contamination of bedrock aquifers in the Black Hills area An executive summary that contains major highlights from the concept paper also has been prepared These documents have been circulated to various interested parties for consideration concept pdf Preliminary concept paper excluding figures conceptfig pdf Preliminary concept paper figures 2 4MB execSummary pdf Executive summary Input regarding the concepts presented in this paper is invited and may be directed to mailto dgdrisco usgs gov Dan Driscoll at dgdrisco usgs gov or mailto ldputnam usgs gov Larry Putnam at ldputnam usgs gov http www usgs gov USGS Home Page http water usgs gov index html WRD Home Page http sd water usgs gov South Dakota District Home Page http water usgs gov public help html Help Comments and questions mailto dgdrisco usgs gov Email dgdrisco usgs gov U S Department of the Interior U S Geological Survey Request http sd water usgs gov forms comment html South Dakota information data Maintainer mailto GS W SD webmaster usgs gov Webmaster http www usgs gov privacy html Privacy Statement http www usgs gov disclaimer html Disclaimer http www usgs gov foia FOIA http www usgs gov accessibility html Accessibility URL http sd water usgs gov research bedrock contaminants http sd water usgs gov research bedrock contaminants
