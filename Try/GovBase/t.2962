MODIS Data MODIS has a viewing swath width of 2 330 km and views the entire surface of the Earth every one to two days Its detectors measure 36 spectral bands between 0 405 and 14 385 m and it acquires data at three spatial resolutions 250m 500m and 1 000m Along with all the data from other instruments on board the Terra spacecraft MODIS data are transferred to ground stations in White Sands New Mexico via the Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System TDRSS The data are then sent to the EOS Data and Operations System EDOS at the Goddard Space Flight Center After Level 0 processing at EDOS the Goddard Space Flight Center Earth Sciences Distributed Active Archive Center GES DAAC produces the Level 1A Level 1B geolocation and cloud mask products Higher level products are produced by the MODIS Adaptive Processing System MODAPS and then are parceled out among three DAACs for distribution There are 44 standard MODIS data products that scientists are using to study global change These products are being used by scientists from a variety of disciplines including oceanography biology and atmospheric science Most users will obtain data products by ordering them through an ordering system see Ordering Data Guide below Users with an appropriate x band receiving system may capture regional data directly from the spacecraft using the MODIS Direct Broadcast signal http

The Release of MOVAS As a result of a collaborative effort between the MODIS Atmosphere Science Disciplines Data Team SDDT and the GSFC Earth Sciences GES DAAC and as part of Dr Yoram Kaufman s AEROCENTER project I am pleased to announce the availability of the MODIS Online Visualization and Analysis System MOVAS The URL is http lake nascom nasa gov www online analysis movas monthly index

Multidisciplinary Sets of MODIS Data Are Now Available for Download A special multidisciplinary set of MODIS data products is now available It is located at ftp modis gsfc nasa gov outgoing Data Sets ftp modis gsfc nasa gov outgoing Data Sets under the descriptor CDROM It was prepared to accelerate general knowledge of the availability of consistent scientifically useful MODIS data products for global modeling and other highly multidisciplinary analyses Further details can be obtained from the Introductory document located at the above ftp address The MODIS Ocean Team headed by Wayne Esias has just released a double cd data set for public use This set of two CD ROMs contains the Terra MODIS Ocean Collection 4 reprocessed data representing a dramatic improvement in quality and consistency over previous data versions The first CD ROM presents a survey of parameters and data types thereby showing the breadth of MODIS Ocean data available The second CD ROM contains a time series of weekly HDF data files movie files depicting one year of weekly images and two presentations on MODIS Ocean data You can access the data set at ftp modis gsfc nasa gov outgoing OCEANS DATA
