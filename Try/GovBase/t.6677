Bridge lower Manhattan and surrounding neighborhoods It will be constructed on the site if the former Emanuel Cellar building was razed in 1998 The project is comprised of three architectural elements the 6 story existing courthouse a 6 story connecting entry hall which includes the main building entrance lobby and cross building connectors and the new courthouse a 14 story limestone clad tower The combined building elements will function as the new court complex The new 222 million building will ultimately house 16 District courtrooms nine Magistrate courtrooms and 29 judges chambers The building will open in 2002 with 12 District Courtrooms for Magistrate courtrooms one Arraignment courtroom and 17 judges chambers To provide for both current needs and beyond areas to be occupied by future courtrooms and chambers will initially house the U S Probation Department which will be relocated from the building as additional court space is needed The courtrooms and chambers are arranged in a collegial layout with a single chambers floor located between two court floors This layout reduces the size if the floorplate creating a more tapered building profile The smaller Magistrate floors located in the upper tower allow the building to be setback at the top The Courthouse will also house a U S Court of Appeals Library offices for the District Court Clerk the Pretrial Services Agency and the U S Marshals Service The building will include a food service facility and a Jury Assembly area as well a below ground parking Designed by HLW International L L P and Cesar Pelli and
