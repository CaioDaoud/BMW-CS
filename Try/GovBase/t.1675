Immunotoxin Therapy of Hairy Cell Leukemia With BL22 Immunotoxin Therapy of Hairy Cell Leukemia With BL22 Anti CD22 Since their development by Kohler and Milstein monoclonal antibodies MoAbs have been used to treat various forms of cancer Occasionally the MoAb itself can kill cancer cells as exemplified by the treatment of low grade lymphomas with Tituxamab However the MoAb alone is often ineffective and must be armed with a cytoxic agent Immunotoxins are produced by attaching protein toxins to MoAbs Initially this was done using chemical coupling agents Subsequently immunotoxins were produced by replacing the binding dmain of a toxin with the Fc portion of a MoAb using the techniques of recombinant DNA These recombinant immunotoxins are more homogeneous than immunotoxins made by chemical coupling In addition because of their small size they penetrate solid tumors effectively BL22 is a recombinant immunotoxin derived from the RFB4 MoAb and a portion of Pseudomonas exotoxin A PE38 that targets cells expressing CD22 CD22 is a glycoprotein adhesion receptor on differentiated B cells that is not prsent on immatire B cells CD22 is also expressed on many B cell malignancues and is very highy expressed in Hairy Cell Leukemia a cancer of the immune system BL22 was produced at the NCO Monoclonal Antibody Recombinant Protein Facility MARP and used in a Phase I clinical trial at NCI to treat patients with B cell malignancies who had failed to respond to standard therapies A very high response rate as observed among patients with refractory Hairy Cell Leukemia with 11 out of 16 patients going into complete remission This finding shows that it is possible to arm a MoAb with a bacterial toxin to successfully treat one type of cancer and suggests that the immunotoxin approach may be useful for other types of cancer BL22 binds to CD22 enters the cell and is processed and translocated to the cytosol where it catalyzes the ADP ribosylation of elongation factor 2 ADP r EF2 and causes death of the leukemia cell Based on the article Efficacy of the anti CD22 recombinant immunotoxon BL22 in chemotherapy resistant hairy cell leukemia by Robert J Kreitman M D Wyndham H Wilson M D Ph D Karen Bergeron R N Miranda Raggio R N Maryalice Stevenson M D David J FitzGerald Ph D and Ira Pastan M D New England Journal of Medicine July 26 2001 Volume 345 pages 241 247 index htm Back
