Branch The Telecommunication Infrastructure Branch The NWSTG is the data central communication switching and monitoring facility and has four major operational components The Central Data Switching System This system is called the http weather gov tg cominfo html Gateway The NWSTG operates and ensures continuous acquisition and dissemination of NWS and other domestic and foreign hydrometeorological data and products The central switching system of the NWSTG controls the exchange of data with remote locations The primary remote locations are with the NWS specialized modeling centers AWIPS and NCF the commercial meteorological community and major international communication switching centers The international switching centers are on the Main Trunk Network MTN of the WMO s Global Telecommunication System This system also operates the Operational Meteorological OPMET data bank It contains aviation METAR TAF and SIGMET data The OPMET data bank supports the International Civil Aviation Organization ICAO World Area Forecast Center WAFC A http weather gov tg histgate html short history of the central switching system describes major modernization upgrade phases that began in the 1950s The Gateway operates web servers and file servers The web and file servers store all nationally generated forecast products and globally received observational data The web service provides browser access to retrieve data and forecasts The file servers provide a file transfer service for retrieval of operational model forecasts and observational data The ASOS Monitoring Center AOMC The AOMC monitors the quality of the sensors in thousands of ASOS automatic observing sites across the United States The AWIPS Network Control Facility NCF The AWIPS NCF manages the AWIPS Wide Area Network WAN and the Satellite Broadcast Network SBN Data streams of the SBN are called NOAAPort A staff for data acquisition and dissemination management This staff manages the processes that determine the routing of data from the Central Data Switching System and establishes message heading identification content and use http www doc gov US Dept of Commerce http www noaa gov National
