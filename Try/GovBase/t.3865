GRB Coordinates Network GCN is composed of three parts The first part the original portion of GCN was called the BATSE COordinates DIstribution NEtwork BACODINE It monitors the BATSE real time telemetry from CGRO calculates RA Dec locations for GRBs that it detects and distributes them to sites around the world in real time a few seconds The second part consists of collecting RA Dec locations of GRBs detected by other spacecraft and distributing that information to the same sites When the second part was incorporated the original BACODINE name was changed to the more general name GCN The third part consists of receiving and automatically distributing to the GRB community prose style e mail messages about follow up observations on various GRBs 1 1 More details of the BATSE derived BACODINE portion To increase the probability that Gamma Ray Burst GRB counterparts can be detected we have built a system of hardware and software that calculates positions of GRBs detected by the BATSE instrument on CGRO and distributes those coordinates to instruments around the world within a time short enough that most GRBs are still bursting The system is called the BATSE COordinates DIstribution NEtwork BACODINE It became possible to do this because of the failure of the on board CGRO tape recorders All the data from CGRO is transmitted to ground in real time instead of delayed transmission from the tape recorder playback http www batse msfc nasa gov BATSE detects 0 8 GRBs per day Folding in multiplicative factors for the fraction of the sky that any ground based instrument can see 0 35 the fraction when it is night 0 50 for the IR to UV band passes and 1 0 for some radio and TeV bandpasses the fraction of clear sky weather 0 75 and the program efficiency 0 60 see discussion below the rate of making follow up observations is 0 063 GRBs per day or once every 16 nights If factors for New Moon 0 50 for the brightest GRBs 0 50 and for the longest GRBs 0 50 are included then the rate is 0 007 per day or once every 4 months for optical instruments and 1 month for radio BATSE has two types of data from the 8 http www batse msfc nasa gov batse instrument Large Area Detectors LAD The high time spectral resolution data are buffered on board the spacecraft for delayed transmission to the ground but there is also 1 024 sec rough spectral resolution data which are transmitted continuously in real time Figure 1 is a timeline of the sequence of steps in the flow of this real time data from BATSE to the GCN BACODINE processing system The count rates for the 8 LADs in 4 energy intervals are accumulated for two 1 024 sec intervals and then transmitted to a TDRS satellite over the next 2 048 seconds The next two 1 024 sec counting rate samples are accumulated while the transmission of the previous 2 samples is in progress and this process repeats continuously For those portions of the orbit 85 where CGRO can get direct line of sight transmission of its high gain antenna to any of the three TDRS satellites the data are relayed to the NASA White Sands Ground Station in New Mexico where they are retransmitted to DOMSAT and then transmitted back down to the Goddard Space Flight Center Data Capture Facility see Figure 2 There is an additional 1 0 seconds of delay due to four hops of ground to geosync orbit light travel time and buffering within the White Sands facility Once received at GSFC the entire 2 048 sec of data is processed to yield GRB coordinates within 0 1 sec The fastest method of coordinates distribution see Table 1 takes an additional 0 3 seconds If the GRB started at the beginning of the first 1 024 sec count rate sample then the total time delay between when the gamma rays interacted with the BATSE LADs and when the coordinates are available at an instrument to make follow up observations is 5 50 seconds If the GRB started at the end of the second 1 024 sec sample then the time delay is 3 45 seconds More than half of the GRBs are longer than 5 5 seconds thus allowing follow up observations to be made while the burst is still occurring See the grb durations html distribution of GRB durations Timeline showing minimum maximum and average time delays from grb to sending coordinates to instruments The average is 4 48 seconds Schematic of the flow of information through the telemetry system While there are several programs running on several computers to do the processing of the BATSE data the sequence of processing can be broken down into five basic steps 1 A program monitors the telemetry stream continuously extracting the count rates for the 8 LADs in the 4 energy intervals 25 50 50 100 100 300 300 keV It uses these rates to determine the current background rates It also extracts some general purpose housekeeping information spacecraft clock RA Dec orientation of the SC etc 2 It monitors the burst in progress flag generated by the BATSE flight processor and when set true it 3 takes the current count rates subtracts the previously accumulated background rates to get the source only rates finds the 3 brightest detectors and 4 solves the set of 3 simultaneous equations of the dot product of the unknown burst direction and the detector normals of the 3 bright detectors 5 The burst direction is then sent to a list of instruments that are capable of making follow up observations The current distribution of GCN sites is shown the two figures a world map and a US map World map showing distribution of GCN sites Sites are clustered in the continental US with outlying sites in Europe Africa Indian Sea South America and Hawaii US map showing distribution of GCN sites Currently the algorithm used to calculate the GRB direction for the BATSE Original Final and MAXBC Notices assumes ideal response physics for the LADs This means 1 that the count rates in the LADs are proportional to the cosine of the angle between the detector normal vector and the GRB direction vector and 2 that there is no distortion of the count rates in each detector due to detection of gamma rays scattered the the Earth s atmosphere or from the spacecraft These two approximations yields an uncertainty for the BATSE Original Final MAXBC burst position of about a 20 deg diameter error circle typical worst case 1 2 The Other non BATSE Sources of GRB Locations As mentioned above in the introductory section the original BACODINE system has been expanded to include GRB location information from other sources It was this expansion that motivated the name change from BACODINE to GCN GRB Coordinates Network Currently the other sources are HETE INTEGRAL IPN RXTE PCA and ASM and ALEXIS although ALEXIS is not strickly GRBs Other now discontinued missions BeppoSAX CGRO COMPTEL and NEAR The details of these contributions are descussed below 1 3 Brief description of the GCN Circulars portion This part allows the GRB community to submit messages to a central queue where they are automatically distributed e mail to the entire GRB community These are prose style messages as opposed to the TOKEN value style of the GCN e mail messages from follow up observers reporting on their results detections or nulls or for coordinating with others Click for the detail of the gcn circulars html GCN Circulars 2 The VARIOUS GRB LOCATION NOTICES There are currently ten different types of location information for GRBs in real or near real time They span a range of delay times after the start of the burst and they span a range of the sizes of the error boxes Each type has its own separate dis enable flag in the sites cfg file controlling the distribution of that type to each site If sites want different filtering ALL VISIBLE NIGHT etc for the different notice types they can have multiple entries in the sites cfg file The comparison is shown in Table 0 and they are described in more detain in the sections below TABLE 0 1 The Various Source of GRB Locations SOURCE TIME

notice types is distributed to the GCN sites The positions in these location notices are derived using the ideal physics response functions for the LADs and therefore have the largest location uncertainties However they are also available to the follow up community with the shortest time delays from the start of the GRB typically less than 5 sec which is shorter than the duration of more than half the GRBs Click for more information on original html Original Coordinates Notices 2a 2 Final Unlike the Original location which uses only the first 1 or 2 seconds of data in the GRB this Final location is based on the integral of the light curve for up to 32 seconds of the GRB The Final Notices report the peak intensity and the fluence during the 32 seconds These two parameters allow the user to assess the importance of the burst With more counting statistics there is slight improvement in the location uncertainty i e it is somewhat systematics dominated Click for more information on final html Final Coordinates Notices 2a 3 MAXBC The MAXBC locations are derived from the 16 Maximum Burst Channels that are determined by the on board BATSE flight software The 16 rates are available to the GCN BACODINE system at T 10 minutes after the trigger They are useful for those situations when the initial GRB BATSE trigger happened within a telemetry gap making the generation of the Original Notice impossible The location uncertainty is comparable to the Original locations Click for more information on maxbc html MAXBC Coordinates Notices 2a 4 LOCBURST This source of GRB location information improves the location uncertainty by a factor of 2 5x over the Original and MAXBC locations It uses the LOCBURST algorithm developed by the BATSE team at MSFC The GCN BACODINE system captures the BATSE telemetry data during a GRB automatically ftp s it to MSFC pages an on call person who then applies the Locburst algorithm plus the advantages of a human in the loop for data better selection calculates a location sends it back to the GCN BACODINE system The GCN BACODINE system monitors for these incoming Locburst locations and distributes them This whole process takes only 15 35 minutes Click for more information on locburst html LOCBURST Coordinates Notices 2a 5 MSFC Admin These reports come out 1 3 days after the burst They are based on the full data set s availalble with the cleanest data chosen and have the smallest error boxes of the BATSE derived Notices These are the best BATSE derived locations available until the periodic BATSE Burst Catalog is issued These GRB locations are not distributed via the normal distribution methods They are available only in the batse grbs html GRB Locations Web Page Table 2a 6 Light Curves The GCN program produces several forms of light curve information for the BATSE triggers GRBs and non GRBs alike Currently these light curves are only available through the batse grbs html GRB Web Page Table There is a column that has links to the various forms and formats of the light curves 1 there are the planewave light curves in the 4 DISCLA energy windows and the IPN light curve in the 20 100 keV window and 2 the formats are ascii text postscript and soon jpeg Soon GCN will also have the ability to e mail the text and postscript forms of the light curves directly to those sites that request this form of information 2b THE OTHER SPACECRAFT INSTRUMENTS GRB LOCATIONS 2b 1 CGRO COMPTEL GRB LOCATIONS no longer available The COMPTEL instrument also on CGRO also can localize GRB particularly the brighter

grbs html Table of Recent SAX WFC NFI Locations 2b 5 IPN POSITION GRB LOCATIONS The GCN system also include automated processing of the NEAR XGRS instrument telemetry data and the Wind KONUS instrument telemetry data on a daily basis This processing looks for GRBs in the data stream and when a burst is found then the lightcurve is auotmatically sent to the K Hurly s automated processing at UC Berkeley for comparison with the Ulysses burst detections Using these 3 s c plus optional location information small error box locations can be obtained Click for a description of the ipn html IPN POSITION GRB location notices 2b 6 IPN SEGMENT GRB LOCATIONS no longer available The GCN system has greatly speeded up the process of producing IPN information by a automatically sending the BATSE light curve data to Kevin Hurley UCB where is it automatically combined with the Ulysses data Given the current situation of having only two spacrecraft with a long baseline only annuli are produced However these annuli are combined with the BATSE Original or BATSE LOCBURST locations to provide arc segments which are then distributed by GCN Click for a description of the ipn html IPN SEGMENT GRB

detected by the http nis www lanl gov nis projects hete HETE MIT spacecraft Because HETE GRB error boxes will be small 0 3 deg X ray Monitor traditional narrow FOV telescopes with much fainter sensitivity can be used to make follow up observations Note The Pagasus failed to deploy the HETE spacecraft but when HETE2 flys launch in the Fall of 2000 GCN will distribute those transient locations as well Oct 2000 HETE2 has been lauched and is undergoing a series of on orbit commissioning checks Once completed the burst positions will be made available through the GCN system See the

enabled or disabled for each site just like the above sources of GRB locations They can be used by sites for end to end testing of their communication link and their instrument Click for the test coords html details 3 DISTRIBUTION METHODS There are 6 methods currently available for distributing the GCN GRB coordinates They are listed in Table 1 and are discussed in more detail below Click here for a table 1 txt plain text version of Table 1 The following table and seven paragraphs only contain a brief description of the distribution methods media For a very detailed description of the contents formats and meaning of these various distribution media methods please see the tech describe html technical details section TABLE 1 GRB COORDINATES DISTRIBUTION METHODS TIME DELAY METHOD MEDIA COMMENTS 0 3 sec Dedicated phone Continuous phone modem connection no longer available 0 1 2 0 sec Socket Fast suited for automated instruments 5 30 sec E mail To any network address 30 90 sec Dialed phone Slower but much cheaper than Dedicated no longer available 60 180 sec Pager RA Dec UT Intensity displayed on the pager 60 180 sec Short Pager RA Dec displayed on the pager 5 180 sec Subject only RA Dec displayed in the Subject line 5 180 sec SubjHHMM only RA Dec Time Intensity displayed in the Subject line in RA HH MM SS format Dedicated Phone no longer available The fastest method is the dedicated phone line Around sunset at the instrument site assuming it s an optical instrument a phone modem connection is made between the GCN computer and the computer at the instrument site This connection is maintained throughout the night and should a burst occur during this time then the coordinates RA Dec UT are sent over the connection At 9600 baud it takes 0 3 seconds Due to a limitation of the US Government phone network here at GSFC this method is only available within the US overseas calls require a human operator in the loop to place the call and this is not possible with a computer initiated call Socket The second fastest method and much less costly it s free is the Internet socket connection Sockets is a technique to connect two computers over a network Like the dedicated phone method the socket connection is made at some initial time and is maintained for long periods of time The GCN system runs continuously allowing sites to connect and disconnect at their leisure The time delay for the propagation of the coordinates packet varies due to the distance between the two computers the number of routers and gateways in between and the amount of other network traffic However we have routinely shown that for a connection between Maryland and California coast to coast US the roundtrip propagation time is typically less than 1 0 seconds and less than 0 1 of the packets take longer than 2 0 seconds packet histos html a histogram of distribution times tech describe html tc17 For the details E mail For those sites that do not have automated instruments the e mail notice distribution method is suitable e mail fmt html Examples of the E mail Notices that are distributed It is still quite fast typically delivery times range from a few seconds to 30 seconds when the destination machine and local gateways are on line All the same information in the Internet socket packets for a burst notification is in the body of the e mail A TOKEN value format was chosen as a reasonable compromise between human readable and machine readable formats The later is useful for sites that have daemons waiting for incoming notices and take further action based on the contents some sites have exploders and some sites parse the information tech describe html tc18 For the details Dialed Phone no longer available GCN also has the capability to dial a predefined phone number at the time of the burst and make a modem transfer of the relevant information The protocols are the same as for the dedicated phone connection method it is just that the establishment of the link at the time of the burst adds a time delay to the receipt of the information however with a great savings in the telephone bill Like the Dedicated Phone method described above Dialed Phone calls are limited to the US overseas calls require an operator Pager The distribution of GCN GRB information is also available via alpha numeric pagers pager fmt html Examples of the Pager messages that are distributed There are several companies http www skytel com SkyTel http www Mobilecomm com Mobilecomm http www metrocall com mcll Metrocall etc which accept e mail and automatically transmit it to the designated pager you can get beeped by the Universe This distribution method is perfect for those sites that do not have Internet access for either e mail or sockets The pager units typically have a limit of 240 characters but this is plenty to display the GRB s RA Dec location the UT time of the burst and the initial intensity the RA Dec are current epoch Current experience shows that the time between the GRB and the beep of the pager is 1 to 3 minutes depending on geography and time of day The main limitation if geographic coverage The companies tend to locate their transmitters in large metropolitan areas cities with more than 50K people and the range seems to be about 20 30 miles Short Pager This is essentially identical to the above Pager capability with the exception that only the RA Dec location Epoch 1950 of the burst is transmitted to and displayed on the pager screen s pager fmt html Examples of the Short form Pager messages that are distributed This reduced information

filtering functions Currently there are several criteria applied to each GRB Location Notice to determine if that notice should be sent to a particular site These distribution criteria are independent of the distribution method sockets e mail pager etc 1 The first criterion is the source of the GRB location information The sources of Notices are HETE INTEGRAL IPN RXTE PCA RXTE ASM BeppoSAX WFC NFI ALEXIS There are dis enable flags bits for each source type for each site in the sites cfg html sites cfg file Sites can elect to receive whichever of the sources they choose Within some notice types there are also subtypes There are dis enable flags for each subtype as well 2 The visibility criteria 2a The use of the ALL filter so that no matter what the visibibilty of the RA Dec location is with respect to the site s location it gets the Notice 2b The notice position must be visible from the site i e take the RA Dec Lon Lat current UT to yield an Az El and test to see if El is greater than 10 degrees above the site s horizon 2c It must be night at the site i e the Sun has an Elevation 6 degs 3 The size of the error box for the burst ie the location uncertainty If the the error is larger than X X degrees the site does not get the Notice 4 The amount of eleapsed time from the start of the burst to the time when the Notice is available for distribution If this time is greater than Y Y hours then the site does not get the Notice 5 There is a brightness criterion if the initial 1 2sec time sample rate data from the burst is greater than X above background then send it The value of X is chosen by the each site Some sites choose an intensity threshold of 0 i e everything and some increase to a value for which the bursts greater than that intensity have a position accuracy commensurate with their FOV 6 There is a trigger type criteria The GCN system can identify the type of BATSE trigger e g real GRB electron precipitation event solar flare SAA entry exit etc It is 98 accurate For the other sources of Notices there have already been selection criteria applied so they are always locations for true GRBs or extreme UV transients in the case of ALEXIS Please see the tech describe html tc25 technical details of these filtering functions There are several motivations for applying one or more of these filtering functions to determine if a site is sent a particular notification Obviously the use of the VISIBLE filter function is appropriate since it is not possible for sites to observe RA Dec locations that are below their horizon Optical instruments can elect to apply the NIGHT filter function so as to not get bothered by notices during the day when they cannot observe Even some radio sites elect to use this NIGHT filter because the ionosphere becomes noisy during the daylight hours in some radio bandpasses The NIGHT filter has the VISIBLE filter included Sites not wishing to restrict their notices by either the VISIBLE or NIGHT filters can elect to use the ALL filter they get everything after any TRIGGER ID or INTENSITY threshold is applied 5 GCN BATSE COORDINATES ACCURACY Original Notices Currently the algorithm used to calculate the GRB direction assumes ideal response physics for the LADs i e no correction for non cos theta and earth scattering And since only the first 1 024 or 2 048 second samples of the light curve rates are used to calculate the location the error in the Original locations is generally dominated by counting statistics not systematics Table 2 shows the radii of circles which contain the Original location from the location calculated by the BATSE instrument team They have the luxury of time cpu power better deconvolution algorithms and human brains in the loop to 1 select good data sets 2 to select clean backgrounds 3 calculate positions As the initial intensity of the burst increases the error decreases Two different error radii are given one describes the circle that contains 68 of the locations and one for 90 containment Click here for a table 2 txt plain text version of Table 2 Also listed in the table are the rate of occurence of triggers versus intensity These are the GRB occurance rates as a function of initial intensity that GCN is able to calculate a location solution i e the program efficiency To calculate the rate that a given site is notified these rates must be multiplied by the appropriate efficiency factors of the site s selected filters table border 2 width 80 TABLE 2 GCN BATSE LOCATION ACCURACY for the Original MAXBC Notices Initial Intensity cnts Error 90 deg Error 68

integrating the light curve beyond the first 1 2 sec up to a total of 32 seconds there is slight improvement in the location uncertainty i e it is somewhat systematics dominated MAXBC Notices Again the ideal physics detector response functions are used on the 16 MAXBC rate data and the location uncertainty is essentially the same as for the above Original type of GRB location notices LOCBURST Notices In general the location uncertainty of these locations will be about 3x better than the Original Final MAXBC Notices The statistical error will range from 0 1 to 2 0 deg for the brightest 90 of the GRBs plus a systematic error of 2 deg to be added in quadrature with the statistical The statistical error as a function of intensity is shown in the following figure M Kippen MSFC Plot showing statistical error as a function of intensity for 70 BATSE Ulysses Gamma Ray Bursts And the percentage of all LOCBURSTs that have a Total error less than X degrees is listed in the Table 2a table

THE SITES In addition to the basic service of distributing GRB coordinates we also provide follow up support activities for the groups doing the follow up observations Groups that have made follow up observations can contact us for the more accurate locations that are available well after the burst These locations come from 1 the Huntsville BATSE team Several days after the burst they have access to the full data set the finer time sampling the better spectroscopy data etc and have the luxury of having humans in the loop for the analysis effort They also have the full blown location algorithm with the non cos theta and scattering corrections 2 The Interplanetary Network IPN also contributes to about 15 of the bursts seen by BATSE The IPN annuli are important because they greatly reduce the amount of sky that must be analyzed looking for a transient 3 COMPTEL and EGRET can provide error boxes that are much smaller than BATSE and again this reduces the amount of analysis a site must perform 4 And on rare occasions the WATCH instruments provide locations When more accurate locations become available we provide these when asked 7 HISTORY EVOLUTION OF THE SYSTEM Since the start of operations in June 1993 there have been many improvements to the system Here is a improvements html chronology and description of these improvements 8 FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS TO THE SYSTEM Future sources of GRB locations To maximize the utility of the GCN system and to minimize the effort by the various follow up groups GCN is persuing an agressive campaign to include any and all sources of GRB locations within the GCN system As each new spacecraft instrument comes on line GCN will do whatever modifications are necessary to incorporate those GRB locations and distribute them to any and all who wish them And like the extreme UV transients detected by the ALEXIS spacecraft GCN will also expand its operations to include any astrophysical transient GRB non GRB alike information The list of future missions that will be distributing their GRB locations includes Swift AGILE and GLAST INTEGRAL has already been incorporated into the GCN system 9 DETAILED TECHNICAL DESCRIPTIONS and

Data Transfer The same hardware and software that captures and processes the BATSE instrument data also captures the http cossc gsfc nasa gov cgro comptel html CGRO COMPTEL instrument data when there is a GRB in the COMPTEL FOV Using a ring buffer with 120 seconds of pre trigger data and 230 seconds of post trigger the data are captured and automatically ftp ed to a COMPTEL computer at U of New Hampshire There the data are automatically analyzed and if the GRB was bright enough for the COMPTEL instrument a location is available 10 15 minutes after the GRB This is particularly useful because the COMPTEL error boxes 1 3 deg are smaller than the BATSE Original Final MAXBC locations They are comparable in size to the BATSE LOCBURST locations and provide and independent check on the LOCBURST

for the appropriate time segment of data to be downlinked from the Ulysses spacecraft via the DSN When the Ulysses data has been transferred from JPL it is searched for a matching GRB and when a significant enough match is found an IPN annulus is calculated and sent back to GSFC This annulus is combined with the BATSE Original Final MAXBC LOCBURST error circle and an a ipn html GCN IPN

PAGES Currently there are two parts of these GCN web pages that are updated automatically in real time so that the user community can have the latest information about what is happening with the GRBs and the operations of the GCN system There is at most a 60 sec delay between when the Notices are distributed to the world community and when the web pages are updated And since these web pages are updated automatically people should remember to use the reload command on their web browsers so that they see the current version of the various pages Real time Coordinates Pages a The first is the batse grbs html BATSE Triggers and Locations page All of the latest and greatest information about the GRB locations from BATSE triggers is listed here Only the BATSE Triggers are listed Original Final MAXBC LOCBURST Light Curves and ADMIN Reports And if any of the BATSE GRBs are detected by other instruments e g RXTE PCA ASM COMPTEL and the IPN these locations are also listed b There is page with all the Notices from the COMPTEL instrument on CGRO even the ones not detected by BATSE It is called the comptel grbs html COMPTEL GRB Locations page This contains both the Detection position and non detection notices c There is page which contains all the Notices from the RXTE spacecraft even the ones not detected by BATSE It is called the rxte grbs html RXTE GRB Locations page This contains both the ALERT and POSITION notices from the RXTE PCA and ASM instruments d There is page which contains all the Notices from the BeppoSAX spacecraft It is called the sax grbs html SAX GRB Locations page This contains the POSITION Notices from both the SAX WFC and NFI instruments e There is also a real time page of the ALEXIS Notices and Locations It is called the alexis trans html ALEXIS UV Transients Locations page Partly Real time Special Burst Information Page The selected html selected burst page contains hyper links to all the information there is to date on specially selected GRBs This information includes Identification date time trigger number etc Locations RA Dec radii annuli maps etc Lightcurves and the archive of the GCN3 follow up observation notices optical radio etc The main criteria that makes a burst special to be included in this page is that follow up observations have been made The partially real time designation means that some of the information in the pages is updated in real time and some of it is done manually usually within minutes to hours Real time Sites cfg File Page The second is the CGN sites cfg html sites cfg file This is a copy of the currently used sites cfg file This allows sites to monitor their configuration entries and verify that they are as requested 12 ACRONYMS TERMS acronyms html A list of GCN related acronyms and terms 13
