Landing Opportunities sts103 landing html launchcommit The failure of a fourth rsu gyroscope on November 13 1999 placed Hubble in http hstsci gsfc nasa gov orbit html safe safe hold until the SM3A rendezvous and grapple on December 20 1999 Servicing Mission 3A successfully replaced equipment and performed maintenance upgrades to the Hubble Space Telescope Although no new scientific instruments were installed many activities took place over 3 glossary html eva EVA days The originally planned 4 days of EVA were changed to 3 days because of the weather delayed launch The deorbit time was fixed for this mission in order to avoid any possible Y2K problems Listed below are a few of the main activities that have taken place More Mission Information current status html Mission Objectives

memory than its predecessor This computer which was successfully tested aboard STS 95 in 1998 on the http hstsci gsfc nasa gov host HOST mission will dramatically increase capabilities reduce maintenance and significantly lower operational costs Aft Shroud Latches Repair Kit ASLRK This kit will fix door latches in the aft shroud area that have been damaged by extreme temperature changes and high torques Planned but not installed because of the shortened mission Fine Guidance Sensors Fine Guidance Sensor FGS Hubble uses three Fine Guidance Sensors for steady pointing and measurement Astronauts will exchange one of these optical sensors with a refurbished unit that has enhanced on orbit alignment capability The new unit is a refurbished version of the one that was returned from Servicing Mission 2 in 1997 The unit it replaces will be refurbished and reinstalled during Servicing Mission 4 in 2003 Handrail Covers Fiberglass fabric called beta cloth will be fitted like sleeves around the handrails above the Fine Guidance Sensor bay These covers prevent possible contamination to the Aft Shroud area from flaking handrail paint New Outer Blanket Layer NOBL The NOBL consists of stainless steel panels covered with a protective thermal coating These panels fit over existing degraded insulation on Hubble s exterior surface to control Hubble s internal temperature In 1997 astronauts on Servicing Mission 2 discovered damaged areas of insulation and performed temporary repairs The NOBL will be permanently mounted Planned but only partially installed because of the shortened mission Rate Sensor Unit Gyroscopes Rate Sensor Units The gyroscopes are part of Hubble s pointing system They provide a frame of reference for Hubble to determine where it is pointing and how that pointing changes as the telescope moves across the sky They report any small movements of the spacecraft to Hubble s pointing and Control System computers The computers then command the spinning reaction wheels to keep the spacecraft stable or moving at the desired rate The gyroscopes work by comparing Hubble s motion relative to the axes of the spinning masses inside the gyroscopes In the absence of external torques these axes remain stable relative to the fixed stars in the sky By keeping Hubble fixed relative to these axes Hubble stays stable relative to the stars Each gyro contains a spinning wheel inside a sealed cylinder This cylinder is immersed in a thick motor oil like fluid Fine hair like wires surrounded by this thick fluid carry electricity to the motor Gyroscopes Exploded View Oxygen pressurized air used to force the thick fluid into the float cavity which contains these wires has corroded the wires and caused them to break Pressurized nitrogen used in the new gyroscopes will eliminate the introduction of corrosive oxygen Hubble has a total of six gyroscopes grouped in pairs inside three Rate Sensor Units RSUs They are arranged in such a way that any three gyroscopes can keep Hubble operating with full accuracy At the end of Servicing Mission 2 all six gyroscopes were working normally From January 1999 until November 13 1999 Hubble had been operating with only 3 functional gyroscopes making it highly desirable to restore the remaining three Now that there are only two functional gyroscopes remaining Hubble is in http hstsci gsfc nasa gov orbit html safe safe hold mode and the science program has been suspended until the completion of Servicing Mission 3A s band single access transmitter S Band Single Access Transmitter SSAT This replacement transmitter uses radio waves to send data to the ground The older unit it replaces will be returned to Earth and refurbished for a later flight Shell Shield Replacement Fabric SSRF The SSRF consists of sheets of flexible aluminized Teflon fabric that fit over the original Multi Layer Insulation on Hubble s forward shell and light shield to add thermal protection In 1997 astronauts on Servicing Mission 2 discovered damaged areas of insulation and performed temporary repairs The SSRF will be permanently mounted over these temporary coverings Planned but not installed Solid State Recorder Solid State Recorder SSR Installation Hubble s original data recorders were mechanical reel to reel tape recorders with many moving parts that wear out over time The digital SSR has no moving parts or tape to break so it is much more robust This next generation recorder is faster and more reliable and it can store 10 times as much data as a mechanical recorder The SSR will replace one of the two remaining tape recorders aboard Hubble Another SSR installed in 1997 continues to perform well Voltage Temperature Improvement Kits VIKs Voltage Temperature Improvement Kits VIKs These protect Hubble s batteries from overcharging and overheating when in safe mode http hstsci gsfc nasa gov activities html Upcoming Activities http hubble gsfc nasa gov servicing missions sm3b html SM3B
