Washington State Department of Community Trade and Economic Development in cooperation with the Governor s Office updated the electricity portion for the Washington State Energy Strategy The previous version of the strategy Washington s Energy Strategy An Invitation to Action was produced more than nine years ago While many of the strategy s analyses and recommendations are still valid there have been major changes in the energy landscape since that time The events of last year also underscored the need to take a new look at the state s electricity policies Last year was one of the most disruptive and unpredictable periods for electricity supply and prices in recent memory Although Washington State avoided the blackouts that seemed a virtual daily occurrence in California and wholesale electricity prices have dropped dramatically in recent months we will still face the impacts for years to come The 1993 Energy Strategy included recommendations on electricity natural gas power plant siting transportation and buildings Because of resource limitations and in view of the energy crisis last year we will instead focus on electricity and natural gas as it relates to electricity Process Tony Usibelli Director of the Energy Policy Division of the Office of Trade Economic Development led this effort together with David Danner Governor Locke s Executive Policy Advisor on energy and telecommunications issues An http www energy cted wa gov Energy 20Strategy Energy 20Strategy 20Advisory 20Committee 20Members pdf advisory committee of approximately 20

public officials to recommend a strategy that would work toward assuring Washington residents of adequate economical and reliable energy while protecting the environment and promoting economic development Washington s Energy Strategy is the result of the Committee s work In 1994 the Legislature enacted ESB 6493 which made Washington s Energy Strategy the primary guidance for implementation of the state s energy policy The legislation also provides for a public process to update the Strategy as needed Also in 1994 Gov Lowry signed an Executive Order implementing the Washington Energy Strategy The Executive Order Determined that the Washington Energy Strategy shall be the policy framework for energy decisions made by state agencies Named the Washington State Energy Office now the Department of Community Trade and Economic Development as the lead agency for implementing the Washington Energy Strategy Directed the Energy Office to convene an interagency working group to ensure efficient coordination and pursue implementation of the most promising policy alternatives in the Strategy Energy Strategy Documents http www energy cted wa gov STRATGY1 HTM Highlights from Washington
