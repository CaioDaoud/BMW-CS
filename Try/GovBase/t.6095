model of Parkinson s disease PD have been able to describe the mechanisms of an important gene s role in the disease Tiago Fleming Outeiro Ph D and Susan Lindquist Ph D of the Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research in Cambridge Massachusetts studied the gene s actions under normal conditions and under abnormal conditions to learn how and when the gene s product alpha synuclein becomes harmful to surrounding cells The scientists created a yeast model that expresses the alpha synuclein gene which has been implicated in PD Yeast models are often used in the study of genetic diseases because they offer researchers a simple system that allows them to clarify how genes work news and events pressrelease parkinson yeast 120403 htm Full article health and medical pubs parkinson disease htr htm Fact Sheet Promising Gene Therapy Tool May Suppress Epileptic Seizures For release Friday November 14 2003 A new gene therapy approach may one day stop seizures in people with common forms of epilepsy

a government funded project provide remarkable new insights into where specific genes are active in the mouse nervous system during development and adulthood Information from this project will advance researchers understanding of how particular genes function in the brain and spinal cord leading to insights about how the nervous system works It also may lead to new ways of preventing or treating

Disease Zeroes In on Activity of Alpha Synuclein For release Thursday October 30 2003 Scientists investigating a rare familial form of early onset Parkinson s disease have discovered that too much of

African American Antiplatelet Stroke Prevention Study AAASPS a large multicenter trial of 1 809 African American stroke patients from over 60 sites in the United States show that aspirin is as effective as ticlopidine for prevention of a second stroke in this population Originally scheduled to run until October 2003 the AAASPS was stopped in July 2002 after analyses suggested that there was
