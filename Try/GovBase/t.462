divergens has focused on movement patterns haulout use and diving behavior of adult males in Bristol Bay This information will be used to identify important foraging areas and track trends in haulout utilization This work will also provide a framework to expand telemetry studies to other segments of the population in different geographical areas More recent research includes investigations into the use of stable isotope techniques and measures of heavy metals as tools for studying large scale movements and dietary habits of walrus In addition other studies are underway to derive methods for monitoring population size through the establishment of new surveys and evaluations of data collected in past monitoring programs in U S and Russia http www absc usgs gov research walrus home html To

cubs Polar bears occur in the ice covered portions of the Bering Chukchi and Beaufort seas adjacent to Alaska Their dependence upon drifting ice makes polar bears an important indicator of global warming and its effects in the Arctic Ongoing studies at the ASC BSO are designed to explain the movements and activities of polar bears by investigating interactions between bears their principal prey ringed seals and the sea ice that supports both of them We are studying changes in movements and distribution patterns of polar bears and learning how understanding those patterns may help address habitat management issues We also are estimating population size and refining our ability to detect and project trends in numbers of polar bears Finally to enhance our ability to protect mother bears and their newborns from human disturbances we are mapping maternal denning habitat and investigating ways to detect bears in dens even when they are buried deep under the driven Arctic

their life in the ocean they eat sleep mate give birth and feed their young at sea Sea otters are the largest members of the weasel family They are also among the smallest of the marine mammals Like all mammals otters breathe air feed milk to their young are warm blooded and have hair on their bodies Sea otters are only found in the North Pacific Ocean where they live along rocky shorelines and sheltered coves Approximately 168 000 sea otters live in the waters off of Alaska and Russia Groups of sea otters called rafts float among the kelp beds where there is plenty of food http www exn ca
