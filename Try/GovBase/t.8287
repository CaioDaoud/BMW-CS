ATSDR s Child Health Program emphasizes the ongoing examination of relevant child health issues in all of the agency s activities and stimulates new projects to benefit children Pediatric Toxicology References ATSDR Division of Toxicology ATSDR is reformatting its toxpro2 html Toxicological Profiles series and mmg html Medical Management Guidelines to expand coverage of the specialized toxicology of children from the womb through late adolescence Special emphasis is devoted to the effect of toxic substances on sensitive developing systems such as the immune nervous and reproductive systems Important new pediatric and developmental toxicology data are being reported from the grtlakes html Great Lakes Human Health Effects Research Program and the Substance Specific Applied Research Program Future issues of toxicological profiles will have five new sections Each profile will have a section on child health in Chapter 1 Public Health Statement which is designed for the lay public ATSDR also distributes these Public Health Statements separately as a compendium A section on children s susceptibility will be added to Chapter 2 and a section on children s exposure will be added to Chapter 5 Data gaps found in analyzing the literature for these child health sections will be explicitly discussed in a new Data Needs section that will be a blueprint for future research to protect child health Priority data needs documents developed from the data needs section in the toxicological profiles will have a child health section as well The profiles will address at a minimum the following issues Are children being exposed or likely to be Are the parents work clothes likely to be source of exposure to children Are unique exposure pathways for children known or possible Are children different than adults in their weight adjusted intake of the toxicant Is the developmental process altered by the toxicant What health effects have been observed in children In immature animals from embryos up through maturity In relevant in vitro developmental models Are pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters known or suspected to be different in children Does the susceptibility of children to health effects differ from that of adults In what way Why Are there any biomarkers of exposure or effect unique to children Are there any interactions with other chemicals that are unique to children ATSDR s widely distributed Fact Sheets are an even more condensed summary for the lay public and also have discussions of child health issues derived from the public health statements Priority Data Needs documents developed from the Data Needs section in the Toxicological Profiles are adding child health sections as well TOP Top Children Living Near Hazardous Waste Sites Division of Health Assessment and Consultation ATSDR continues to direct and apply substantial resources to child focused concerns through its mandated public health assessment activities Children have been the primary focus of public health assessment evaluations especially at sites where direct contact with contaminated soils and dusts is an important pathway of exposures Because of their activity patterns and greater sensitivity to metals pesticides nitrates and other substances that may cause long term harm children are usually considered the most sensitive populations at sites and are the initial focus of investigations ATSDR is working to further improve the manner in which health assessors evaluate issues relating to children For example ATSDR s training course on basic public health assessment had an increased focus on evaluating the impact of hazardous substances in the environment on children Topics discussed in the course which is taken by agency and state health assessors include children s behaviors that influence exposure frequency physiologic and biochemical factors that might lead to greater sensitivity to hazardous substances the role of exposure investigations and the influences of culture diet and nutritional status The course emphasizes that caution must be exercised in trying to extrapolate information from adults to children because children are not simply small adults ATSDR plans to modify its ednpha html Public Health Assessment Guidance Manual to reflect the increased emphasis on evaluating children s health issues and methods for making those evaluations ATSDR also recognizes the need to expand its HazDat database to include data on children s issues at hazardous waste sites so we can learn more about the characteristics of children that influence exposure and the potential development of adverse health effects There is also an increased emphasis on the use of exposure investigations to confirm present exposures In addition at sites where biologic or environmental data are limited and unlikely to be obtained modeling and relational geographic information systems are used to obtain more accurate estimates of past exposure These tools will increasingly be used at sites and will assist in conducting epidemiological studies of people who may have been exposed as children ATSDR has used geographic information systems to estimate the number of children living near National Priority List NPL sites On the basis of data from 1 255 sites there were 1 127 563 children under 6 years of age living within 1 mile borders of the sites or about 11 of the potentially affected population Women of child bearing age account for about 24 of the population near waste sites The average site population at these sites was 8 073 people and the average number of children under 6 years of age was 898 TOP Top TOP TOP Investigations of Cancer and Other Health Conditions Division of Health Studies The Division of Health Studies DHS is responsible for evaluating the relationship between exposures to hazardous substances and adverse human health effects Children have been emphasized frequently in studies because of their greater sensitivity to toxic effects and their greater likelihood of exposure from play and other behavior patterns For example past studies have demonstrated excess exposures to metals lead and arsenic as well as elevated risks of adverse reproductive outcomes among children born to mothers exposed to solvent contaminated drinking water ATSDR is seeking new databases to evaluate adverse health effects in children National registries of childhood illnesses especially cancers are under consideration ATSDR plans to develop environmental assessment procedures for a national children s environmental cancer registry in cooperation with other federal agencies ATSDR also continues to evaluate its existing data collection systems for their ability to address children s health issues for example the National Exposure Registry Currently registrant cohorts exposed to trichloroethylene TCE trichloroethane TCA benzene and dioxin are followed This registry is identifying databases that provide the necessary comparative rates for generating testable hypotheses for a broader range of health end points that are directed at the health of children The registry also is giving additional emphasis to including adequate numbers of children in the sub registries ATSDR also is continuing several key health studies see following list to identify information needs and initiate research and improve program activities to focus more specifically on children s health ATSDR is improving the review of health studies and extramural awards by including more pediatricians in the peer review process and by promoting children s health issues when announcing requests for proposals Additional health outcomes specific to children are being identified to make health studies more sensitive to illnesses experienced by children and ATSDR seeks to identify health outcome databases that record these outcomes Ongoing Studies Birth Defects and

of Pediatrics AAP to conduct the innovative Environmental Safety Net for Children workshop and follow up activities The 100 attendees at the March 2001 workshop included practicing local pediatricians internationally known speakers and collaborating government agency experts concerned with pediatric environmental health The workshop proceedings will be published as a supplement to the AAP journal Pediatrics For additional information on the AAP project please contact Lourdes Rosales Guevara MD the AAP Technical Project Officer at 404 498 0295 Although there are many other on going DHEP child health related activities including the pediatric HEC CSEM Case Study in Environmental Medicine and the children s risk perception study the rest of this section will focus on the Pediatric Environmental Health Specialty Unit PEHSU Program The PEHSU Program The PEHSU Program was designed to promote children s health by encouraging medical specialists with environmental expertise to work collaboratively with pediatricians to develop pediatric environmental medical expertise and to improve the ability of locally practicing health care providers and parents to access this expertise Starting in 1998 through a partnership with the Association of Occupational and Environmental Clinics AOEC three pilot units were established in Seattle Boston and New York City These units focused on conducting activities in the areas of 1 medical education and training 2 telephone clinical consultation and outreach and 3 clinical evaluation of children who may have been exposed to hazardous substances in the environment From this modest beginning in FY 01 the Program had grown to include national network of 11 operating units inclusion of EPA as a partner in all of these units increasing international interest in establishing similar units continuing and increasing interest and demand for these services from governmental agencies at all levels and from the public opportunities to collaborate with additional partners such as NIEHS EPA CDC Centers of Childrens Environmental Health and Disease Prevention Research impact on field of pediatric environmental health development of a body of published articles curricula and educational materials There is at least one PEHSU in each of the 10 EPA ATSDR regions Most of the PEHSU have websites Links are provided here http www

Many ATSDR scientists have a particular interest in child health issues and have assisted in the development of ATSDR s Child Health Initiative ATSDR formed an internal Agency Roundtable on Child Health ARCH through which staff can exchange information and findings from existing child relevant projects and generate proposals for new ones The ARCH is composed of representatives of different divisions and offices of the agency It provides a basis for information exchange and a mechanism for internal review and advice In addition ARCH members are contacted individually from time to time to help prepare review and present information to ATSDR senior management and outside agencies and groups Many thanks to Stephanie Rubin and the ATSDR Web Site Content Committee This page last updated on
