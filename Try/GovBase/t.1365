Gathersburg MD On April 3 1998 the Energy Facility Contractors Group EFCOG Executive Committee fully endorsed the idea of creating a users group for internal dosimetry and radiobioassay and indicated that their respective organizations would fully support participation BIDUG was sanctioned at the May 1998 meeting of the Radiological Protection Working Group RPWG chaired by Joe Graf of Los Alamos National Laboratory Formal organization of BIDUG is underway including a charter and operating procedures fancy horizontal bar The consensus of EFCOG members was that one should Never compare data with minimum detectable amount MDA LD Do report less than DL Do not report less than MDA Compare data with decision level DL LC ANSI HPS N13 30 1996 Performance Criteria for Radiobioassay equates MDA with Currie s 1968 detection level LD and DL with curries critical level LC Some Bayesian statisticians have argued that these equations are not true since for example one may have a decision level that differs from Currie s LC There was consensus on what constituted correct use of DL and MDA as shown above Figure adapted from Rick Brake of Los Alamos National Laboratory fancy horizontal bar
