DIRECTOR OFFERS ADVICE ON SAFE CLEANUP OF FIRE ASH SACRAMENTO State Health Director Diana M Bont R N Dr P H today advised Southern California residents to use caution in cleaning up ash from recent wildfires The ash deposited by forest fires is relatively nontoxic and similar to ash that might be found in your fireplace However any ash will contain small amounts of cancer causing chemicals In addition ash may be irritating to the skin especially to those with sensitive skin If the ash is inhaled it can be irritating to the nose throat and lungs and may cause coughing Exposure to airborne ash may trigger asthmatic attacks in individuals who already have asthma Therefore in order to avoid possible health problems the following steps are recommended Do not allow children to play in the ash Wash ash off toys before children play with them Clean ash off house pets Wear gloves long sleeved shirts and long pants and avoid skin contact If you do get ash on your skin wash it off as soon as possible Some wet ash can cause chemical burns If you have a vegetable garden or fruit trees wash the fruits or vegetables before eating them Avoid getting ash into the air as much as possible Do not use leaf blowers or take other actions that will put ash into the air Shop vacuums and other common vacuum cleaners do not filter out small particles They blow such particles out the exhaust into the air where they can be inhaled The use of shop vacuums and other non HEPA filter vacuums is not recommended HEPA filter vacuums could be used if available Well fitting dust masks may provide some protection during cleanup A mask rated N 95 or P 100 that forms a seal on you face will be more effective in blocking particles than simple surgical or dust masks In general many ash particles are larger than those found in smoke Thus wearing a dust mask can significantly reduce but not completely eliminate the amount of particles inhaled Anyone with heart or lung disease should consult a physician before using a mask during post fire cleanup Gentle sweeping of indoor and outdoor hard surfaces followed by wet mopping is he best procedure in most cases A damp cloth or wet mop may be all that is needed on lightly dusted areas The Regional Water Quality Control Boards have asked the public to avoid washing ash into storm drains as much as possible Use as little water as possible to wet down ash Collected ash may be disposed of in the regular trash Ash may be stored in plastic bags or other containers that will prevent it from being disturbed Bont said ash and debris inside burned structures may contain more toxic substances than forest fire ash because of the many synthetic materials present in buildings Older buildings in particular may contain asbestos and lead Professional assistance should be sought in the removal of ash and other debris from burned structures o0o PageTop Back to Top of Page 2003 State of California http www dhs ca gov home policyuse Conditions of Use
