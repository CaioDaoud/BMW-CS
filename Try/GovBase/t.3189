Office ASC BSO in cooperation with the National Park Service is conducting a number of research projects in Glacier Bay National Park and Preserve GBNPP Most of the research is in response to issues of concern for GBNPP resource managers although ASC BSO researchers are also availing themselves of the extraordinary research setting of Glacier Bay to conduct breakthrough science with broad application ASC BSO has collected years of data on crabs and halibut as a baseline prior to recent closures of certain portions of the Bay Now that the areas have been closed new studies are being designed to use these de facto fisheries reserves for evaluating the effectiveness of Marine Protected Areas MPA as a fisheries management option The Glacier Bay closures are providing the first major opportunity to evaluate MPAs in the North Pacific Extensive data is being collected on oceanography of this dynamic and changing habitat The bottom is being thoroughly mapped as well These extensive data sets will be correlated with observations on halibut crabs sea otters seabirds and their prey to further understand the connections among ecosystem components ASC BSO has amassed large amounts of fisheries data particularly for Dungeness crabs and halibut Several previous paradigms have been brought into question For example our data have revealed that Glacier Bay halibut do not necessarily migrate to the open Pacific Ocean as much as had been thought and appear to have fairly limited home ranges within the Bay Sea otters are gradually recolonizing Glacier Bay They have remarkably strong effects on the ecology of the marine ecosystem wherever they graze heavily ASC BSO researchers are documenting the resultant ecosystem changes and differentiating between effects due to sea otters and changes in commercial fisheries for species such as crabs one of the otters favorite prey ASC BSO is developing detailed scientifically credible methods for long term monitoring of the rocky intertidal zone to help Park resource managers detect both human induced and natural changes Several seabird studies include research on the possible impacts of subsistence egg collecting on seagulls nesting at Marble Island monitoring the population trends and ecology of black legged kittiwakes and documenting the seasonal distribution of seabirds on Park waters Small schooling fish are the basis for a number of predator populations of fish seabirds and marine mammals ASC BSO scientists are documenting the abundance distribution and species composition of these critical populations in relation to oceanographic and habitat features Glacial recession over the past 200 years has uncovered numerous small streams These interdisciplinary studies are revealing the important factors in biological development of stream communities Results will provide clues for managers trying to restore degraded streams in populated areas of the Pacific Northwest and Alaska A new study is being designed to help Park managers monitor the frequency and severity of bear human interactions at popular campsites and then create a management scheme to minimize dangers to humans and bears Glacier Bay National Park panorama The myriad ASC BSO and other studies in Glacier Bay provide a rare opportunity to coordinate scientific findings and information among all the various ecosystem components being studied ASC BSO scientists are seeking opportunities with our cooperators to promote and support integration at every step to formulate one of the first true Ecosystem Studies in the marine environment of the
