Immunization How to get shot records People are surprised to learn that presently there is no centralized computer that maintains immunization records To get immunization records you need to obtain the records from the physician medical center or local health jurisdiction that provided the immunizations Do people have a right to get copies of their medical records Yes However the Department of Health only has jurisdiction over what fees providers may set for charging for copies of medical records This is adjusted based on changes in the consumer price index The providers don t have to release the medical records until they are paid for the copies Providers may charge a 19 clerical fee for searching and handling records 83 cents per page for first 30 pages and 63 cents per page for pages after that If you have trouble getting a provider to release the copies the civil remedies are within the court system See http www leg wa gov RCW index cfm fuseaction chapterdigest chapter 70 02 RCW 70 02 for the law http www leg wa gov RCW index cfm fuseaction section section 70 02 170 The civil remedies are in 70 02 170 If a provider refuses to provide copies under this law then an unprofessional conduct complaint may be in order See complaint information above Questions on HIV AIDS People acquire HIV through unprotected sexual intercourse with an infected person or through sharing needles or syringes used for injecting drugs An infected woman may pass the virus to her baby during or immediately after pregnancy HIV is not spread by casual contact by donating blood eating in restaurants or using public toilets telephones or swimming pools People infected with HIV may not have any symptoms for several years but can still infect their sex or needle sharing partners There are no symptoms that are specific only to an HIV infection The only way a person can know if he or she is infected is to have a test for HIV antibodies Antibodies to an HIV infection are almost always produced within three to six months after infection Local health departments and private doctors can provide counseling and testing for people who are unsure of their HIV infection status If you have
