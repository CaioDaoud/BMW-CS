WOODS HOLE PASSAGE MA Issued March 28 1991 In the narrow part of Woods Hole Passage NOS Current Location Woods Hole 0 1 mile SW of Devils Foot Island the current velocity at times exceeds 4 5 knots Velocities as high as 5 0 knots have been reported by the U S Coast Guard Currents in Woods Hole Passage computed from the daily predictions at Cape Cod Canal from the NOS publication Tidal Current Tables Atlantic Coast should be used with caution Actual velocities may exceed predicted values by 10 to 20 Hourly velocities and directions as shown on Tidal Current Charts Naragansett Bay to Nantucket should be used only with EXTREME CAUTION These differences from previously published data result from dredging filling shoaling and other modifications since the 1931 survey Funding for a new current survey of the Naragansett Bay Nantucket area is currently not available Oceanographic Go to Top of page Oceanographic Top NEW YORK HARBOR NY NJ Issued June 27 1996 this notice supersedes the cautionary Notice to Mariners concerning Current Predictions for this area issued on October 16 1991 Tidal Currents in Arthur Kill and Kill van Kull NY NJ have been significantly affected by extensive operations by the U S Army Corps of Engineers COE particularly at Bergen Point A Physical Oceanographic Real Time System PORTS has also been installed to provide real time Tide Current and Meteorological data for the New York Harbor area Current data is limited at this time to Bergen Point Tidal Currents at The Narrows and at Hell Gate NY have been reported to deviate significantly from official predictions published by the National Ocean Service NOS There are no funds available at the present time to expand the PORTS system to include real time current data for either The Narrows or Hell Gate Mariners should exercise caution and discretion in the use of published Current Predictions for these two locations NEW YORK HARBOR NY Issued October 17 1991 Effective October 28 1991 the Tidal Current Charts New York Harbor will be officially withdrawn from distribution A recent evaluation shows that the New York Harbor charts last revised in 1976 are inadequate when compared to the more recent information as published in the Tidal Current Tables Atlantic Coast of North America including Greenland Due to resource constraints NOS plans no further revision of its tidal current chart series Oceanographic Go to Top of page Oceanographic Top CHINCOTEAGUE CHANNEL VA Issued May 17 1991 United States Coast Guard USCG Personnel at the Chincoteague Coast Guard Station VA report that the times of high and low water computed from differences in Table 2 of the East Coast Tide Tables are frequently off by as much as an hour The channel is subject to shoaling and is frequently dredged Exercise caution in using Table 2 Tide differences for this area HAMPTON ROADS VA Issued March 24 1992 Tidal currents in Hampton Roads and Elizabeth River have been significantly altered by dredging and construction of a new bridge tunnel Recent dredging by the U S Army Corps of Engineers has deepened the channels by 10 feet to a depth of 50 feet Pilots and officials at the Norfolk Naval Base report hazardous conditions including significantly higher than predicted maximum current velocities and significant deviation in the predicted times of maximum current Mariners should exercise EXTREME CAUTION and DISCRETION in the use of published NOS tidal current predictions for this area Funding for a Quality Assurance study and a full scale resurvey of the area is presently not available Oceanographic Go to Top of page Oceanographic Top LITTLE CREEK VA AND THIMBLE SHOALS CHESAPEAKE BAY VA Issued March 24 1992 The velocity of the currents off the entrance to Little Creek Va may be significantly stronger than indicated by published NOS predictions Pilots at the Naval facilities at Little Creek indicate that the condition is potentially very hazardous Mariners should exercise EXTREME CAUTION and DISCRETION in the use of published NOS tidal current predictions for this area Funding for a Quality Assurance study and a full scale resurvey of the area is presently not available CHESAPEAKE DELAWARE CANAL AND BALTIMORE HARBOR CONNECTING CHANNELS Issued June 5 1996 The US Army Corps of Engineers COE is planning a project involving the Chesapeake Delaware Canal C D and the channels in the upper Chesapeake Bay connecting the canal to Baltimore MD in 1996 1997 Such projects in the past in other areas have resulted in dramatic changes in the observed tidal currents of those areas Once the project begins the Tidal Current predictions for the C D Canal and the channels connecting the canal to Baltimore should be considered questionable and potentially dangerous to rely upon Tide predictions will be affected but to a lesser degree Funding for a real time system to monitor the Tidal Currents and a resurvey these areas after COE operations are complete is presently not available Therefore once COE operations begin and until such time as a real time system is installed or a resurvey of the area conducted the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration National Ocean Service will be unable to provide accurate Tidal Current predictions necessary for marine safety and navigation in this area Oceanographic Go to Top of page Oceanographic Top WILMINGTON AND CAPE FEAR RIVER NC Issued June 5 1996 The US Army Corps of Engineers COE is due to begin dredging operations in the Wilmington and Cape Fear River area in 1997 The plans call for the deepening of the channel approaching Wilmington and extending up the Cape Fear River Such actions in the past in other areas have resulted in dramatic changes in the observed tidal currents of those areas Once dredging operations commence the Tidal Current predictions for this region should be considered questionable at best and potentially dangerous to rely upon Tide predictions will also be affected but to a lesser degree Funding for a real time system to monitor the Tidal Currents during the project and a resurvey of the area after COE operations are complete is presently not available Therefore once COE operations begin and until such time as a real time system is installed or a resurvey of the area conducted the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration National Ocean Service will be unable to provide accurate Tidal Current predictions necessary for marine safety and navigation in this area CHARLESTON HARBOR SC Issued June 5 1996 The US Army Corps of Engineers COE is planning dredging and construction projects for Charleston Harbor in 1996 1997 Such projects in the past in other areas have resulted in dramatic changes in the observed tidal currents of those areas Once dredging and or construction operations commence the Tidal Current predictions for this region should be considered questionable and potentially dangerous to rely upon Tide predictions will also be affected but to a lesser degree Funding for a real time system to monitor the Tidal Currents and a resurvey of the area after COE operations are complete is presently not available Therefore once COE operations begin and until such time as a real time system is installed or a resurvey of the area conducted the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration National Ocean Service will be unable to provide accurate Tidal Current predictions necessary for marine safety and navigation in this area Oceanographic Go to Top of page Oceanographic Top BISCAYNE BAY PORT OF MIAMI FL Issued September 29 1983 The Biscayne Bay Pilots report variances between predicted and actual currents Cross channel current variations in Government Cut are particularly difficult to negotiate Caution should be exercised when entering Government Cut from the sea during flood tide with northeasterly winds a strong turning torque occurs when the bow is just inside the north jetty A similar but less serious situation occurs when leaving the port during ebb tide Horizontal current gradients occur in the turning basin immediately west of Government Cut which may make maneuvering difficult The Coast Guard reports that ships may encounter current anomalies at the mouth of the Miami River which have caused occasional groundings ST AUGUSTINE FL ATLANTIC INTRACOASTAL WATERWAY Issued June 5 1996 The US Coast Guard USCG has reported a problem involving the Tidal Currents in the Atlantic Intracoastal Waterway AICW in the St Augustine FL area The specific location is the Bridge of Lions over the waterway Numerous accidents have occurred at this site which are related to the currents in the waterway There is no National Ocean Service NOS Tidal Current Station at or near the Bridge of Lions Thus the NOS cannot at this time make Tidal Current predictions for this location The USCG states that the cause of the accidents is loss of maneuverability control as a vessel passes under the bridge The loss of maneuverability results in the vessel striking the bridge supports The USCG states in part The affect of a fair tide on a navigating vessel is to reduce the vessel s ability to maneuver When a vessel is proceeding with a current fair tide less water flows across the vessel s rudders This condition has the affect of reducing the vessel s maneuverability for a given speed over ground all other things being equal The Bridge of Lions is a difficult bridge to navigate even under ideal conditions This circa 1926 Bascule bridge has a horizontal clearance of only 76 verses the 90 horizontal clearance of most of the other bridges on this section of the AICW In addition according to the US Coast Pilot Vol 4 Chapter 12 Tidal Currents in excess of 2 knots often run at right angles to the bridge opening The Coast Pilot advises mariners to transit the bridge at minimal Tidal Current conditions Funding for real time monitoring of the Tidal Currents or a survey to obtain Tidal Current observations upon which to base Tidal Current predictions for this location is not presently available A consortium of local state and federal officials in conjunction with the private sector and commercial shipping interests are presently studying various options to provide accurate Tidal Current predictions necessary for marine safety and navigation at this location Oceanographic Go to Top of page Oceanographic Top Published Precautionary Notices Gulf Coast of the U S Originally published in Local Notice to Mariners and United States Coast Pilot Notices

significantly altered by dredging and construction activities Tidal predictions for the Tidal Reference Station at Aberdeen have been updated to reflect these changes Tidal Current predictions for this area should be considered questionable and potentially dangerous to rely upon Funding for a real time system to monitor the Tidal Currents or a resurvey of this area is not available at this time Therefore until such time as a real time system is installed or a resurvey of the area conducted the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration National Ocean Service will be unable to provide

Coast Guard has reported investigating an incident at the Pacific Gas and Electric Co terminal located off Moss Landing The terminal is located at the head of Monterey Canyon The incident was apparently caused by strong currents moving landward through Monterey Canyon and resulted in a hydraulic jump where the canyon narrows and finally ends USCG reports indicate that a tanker was set on the oil terminal buoy at the facility The chain that connects the buoy and the transfer hose became fouled around the propeller of the tanker Extreme caution should be exercised while in this area particularly while engaged in transfer operations SAN FRANCISCO BAY CALIFORNIA Issued October 17 1991 Effective October 21 1991 the Tidal Current Charts San Francisco Bay will be officially withdrawn from distribution A recent evaluation shows that the San Francisco Bay charts last revised in 1969 are inadequate when compared to the more recent information as published in the Tidal Current Tables Pacific Coast of North America and Asia Due to resource constraints NOS plans no further revision of its tidal current chart series SAN FRANCISCO BAY CALIFORNIA Issued June 5 1996 This notice supersedes the cautionary Notice to Mariners concerning Current Predictions for this area issued on October 16 1991 A Physical Oceanographic Real Time System PORTS has been installed in San Francisco Bay CA This system provides real time Tide Current and Meteorological data The PORTS system should be used for Current Predictions instead of published values whenever possible Published Current Predictions will be updated as soon as enough data has been collected to compute accurate constituents upon which to base improved predictions Oceanographic Go to Top of page Oceanographic Top HUMBOLDT BAY CALIFORNIA Issued June 5 1996 The US Coast Guard USCG and the Harbor Safety Committee HSC for Humboldt Bay have indicated that projects by the US Army Corps of Engineers COE since 1985 have degraded the accuracy of the Tide and Tidal Current predictions for Humboldt Bay The primary tide station for Humboldt Bay is located on North Spit on the ocean side and thus does not reflect the changes that have occurred within the bay itself Tidal Current predictions within Humboldt Bay should be used with extreme caution The last update of secondary tide stations within the bay occurred in 1985 A hydrographic survey of Humboldt Bay is scheduled to begin in the last quarter of 1996 Some of the secondary tide locations within the bay will be updated in conjunction with this survey Funding for a real time system to monitor the Tidal Currents or a new Tidal Current survey is not presently available Therefore until such time as a real time system is installed or a resurvey of the area conducted the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration National Ocean Service will be unable to provide accurate Tidal Current predictions necessary for marine safety and navigation in this area SAN DIEGO CALIFORNIA Issued June 5 1996 The US Army Corps of Engineers COE is planning a dredging project for the US Navy in the area of the North Island Naval Base in San Diego Harbor This project calls for both deepening and widening the channel to accommodate larger naval vessels Such actions in the past in other areas have resulted in dramatic changes in the observed Tidal Currents of those areas Once dredging operations commence the Tidal Current predictions for this region should be considered questionable and potentially dangerous to rely upon Tidal predictions will also be affected but to a lesser degree Funding for a real time system to monitor the Tidal Currents during the project and a resurvey of the area after COE operations are complete are presently not available
