Stable funding for all BSC activities Complete cooperation and collaboration between BSC staff and the staff of proposing and adopting state agencies PageTop Back to Top of Page Challenges Areas of consumer and legislative interest are almost as diverse as the building code itself Building regulations involve areas such as health fire and panic safety employee safety energy conservation and handicapped accessibility These regulations impact various consumer and building industry groups such as apartment owners architects engineers and insurance companies California is a leader in the regulation of its building industry particularly in the areas of handicap accessibility and energy conservation However the current regulatory process is much more complex than in past years Controversial and complex building standards and new emerging model codes and national standards present a challenge to the BSC in determining if such codes and standards are in the public interest If the BSC were to approve and publish standards that were not in the public interest it would cause confusion create problems and place an unreasonable burden on the public and the building industry My
