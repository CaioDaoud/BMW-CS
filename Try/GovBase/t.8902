Statement How long will it take to get a job Each case is very individualized based on a consumer s needs and goals Also there is a waiting list for services Based on medical information and other assessments applicants fall into one of three categories most severely disabled severely disabled and disabled Currently DOR is able to serve the first two categories If you are assessed as being in a category we are serving you may have little or no wait before receiving rehabilitation services If you are in a category we are not serving it could be several months You will periodically receive notification from DOR with an update on the categories we are serving and the status of the waiting list After you are a consumer it can take a few weeks to several months or years depending on the number and level of services you need to get job ready and find employment I need information about my rights under the Americans with Disabilities Act DOR has an ada default htm Disability Access unit that provides basic information on the ADA Its primary purpose is to give information and training to State Government agencies It is not an enforcement entity The http www usdoj gov U S Department of Justice has an excellent web site that details rights remedies and enforcement of the ADA Do you provide housing Medical Services Vans DOR only provides vocational rehabilitation services We do not provide any housing services If you are a consumer and within your plan for employment it is determined that you need some special medical service or transportation to get or keep your job then we may provide it We do not have a van program for individuals All transportation needs are met as part of an overall consumer case plan Vans are the most expensive transportation option for consumers If there is another equally reasonable and less expensive method such as public transportation or special transit that is the method we use exec comment htm Comment Form webtoc htm Table
