estimated 190 million acres of federal forests and rangelands in the U S an area twice the size of California face high risk of catastrophic fire Years of natural fuels buildup coupled with drought insect and disease damage make our forests vulnerable to environmentally destructive fires Many ponderosa pine forests are 15 times denser than they were a century ago Where 25 to 35 trees once grew per acre now more than 500 trees are crowded together in unhealthy conditions In 2000 the United States suffered its worst wildland fires in 50 years Last year s fire season among the worst in the last 40 years saw 88 458 fires burn 7 2 million acres an area larger than Maryland and Rhode Island combined Three states Oregon Colorado and Arizona had their worst fires in history in 2002 The Bush Administration through the Department of the Interior agencies and the Forest Service at the Department of Agriculture is responding to this challenge by proposing record levels of funding for firefighting up 55 percent from 2000 hiring additional fire fighters purchasing additional equipment accomplishing record levels of fuels treatment this year s estimated 2 8 million acres being treated is up 1 600 000 acres since 2000 and by advancing its Healthy Forests Initiative as a long term solution On December 3 2003 President George W Bush signed the Healthy Forests Restoration Act
