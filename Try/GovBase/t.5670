Investigations In addition to discussing recent caselaw the Manual incorporates the important changes made to the laws governing electronic evidence gathering by the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001 Pub L No 107 56 115 Stat 272 2001 the PATRIOT Act These changes are discussed primarily in Chapters 3 and 4 Many of the provisions of the PATRIOT Act relevant here would unless reenacted into law sunset on December 31 2005 Accordingly prosecutors and agents are urged to inform the Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section CCIPS at 202 514 1026 whenever use of the new authorities proves helpful in a criminal case This information will help ensure that Congress is fully informed when deciding whether to reenact these provision Nathan Judish of CCIPS took primary responsibility for the revisions in this Manual under the supervison of Martha Stansell Gamm Chief of the Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section Assistance in editing was provided by CCIPS attorneys in alphabetical order Richard Downing Mark Eckenwiler David Green Patricia McGarry Paul Ohm Richard Salgado Michael Sussmann and summer interns Matthew Heintz Andrew Ting Arun Subramanian and Amalie Weber Also providing helpful suggestions were Thos Gregory Motta and Lynn Pierce of the Office of General Counsel of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and Computer and Telecommunication Coordinators CTCs Arif Alikhan Mark Califano Scott Christie and Steven Schroeder This edition owes a tremendous debt to Orin S Kerr principal author of the 2001 edition who departed from the Department of Justice in 2001 to teach at the George Washington University Law School The 2001 edition superseded the 1994 Federal Guidelines for Searching and Seizing Computers and reflected an enormous expenditure of time and thought on the part of Mr Kerr and a number of attorneys at CCIPS AUSAs and specialists at the Federal Bureau of Investigation and other federal agencies The organization and analysis of the 2001 edition has been retained here not because of inertia but because they have proven to be sound and enduring As is true with most efforts of this kind the Manual is intended to offer assistance not authority Its analysis and conclusions reflect current thinking on difficult areas of law and do not represent the official position of the Department of Justice or any other agency It has no regulatory effect and confers no rights or remedies Electronic copies of this document are available from the Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section s web site http www cybercrime gov www cybercrime gov The electronic version will be periodically updated and prosecutors and agents are advised to check the website s version for the latest developments Inquiries comments and corrections should be directed to Nathan Judish at 202 514 1026 Requests for paper copies or written correspondence will be honored only when made by law enforcement officials or by public institutions Such requests should be sent

INTRODUCTION In the last decade computers and the Internet have entered the mainstream of American life Millions of Americans spend several hours every day in front of computers where they send and receive e mail surf the Web maintain databases and participate in countless other activities Unfortunately those who commit crime have not missed the computer revolution An increasing number of criminals use pagers cellular phones laptop computers and network servers in the course of committing their crimes In some cases computers provide the means of committing crime For example the Internet can be used to deliver a death threat via e mail to launch hacker attacks against a vulnerable computer network to disseminate computer viruses or to transmit images of child pornography In other cases computers merely serve as convenient storage devices for evidence of crime For example a drug kingpin might keep a list of who owes him money in a file stored in his desktop computer at home or a money laundering operation might retain false financial records in a file on a network server The dramatic increase in computer related crime requires prosecutors and law enforcement agents to understand how to obtain electronic evidence stored in computers Electronic records such as computer network logs e mails word processing files and jpg picture files increasingly provide the government with important and sometimes essential evidence in criminal cases The purpose of this publication is to provide Federal law enforcement agents and prosecutors with systematic guidance that can help them understand the legal issues that arise when they seek electronic evidence in criminal investigations The law governing electronic evidence in criminal investigations has two primary sources the Fourth Amendment to the U S Constitution and the statutory privacy laws codified at 18 U S C 2510 22 18 U S C 2701 12 and 18 U S C 3121 27 Although constitutional and statutory issues overlap in some cases most situations present either a constitutional issue under the Fourth Amendment or a statutory issue under these three statutes This manual reflects that division Chapters 1 and 2 address the Fourth Amendment law of search and seizure and Chapters 3 and 4 focus on the statutory issues which arise mostly in cases involving computer networks and the Internet Chapter 1 explains the restrictions that the Fourth Amendment places on the warrantless search and seizure of computers and computer data The chapter begins by explaining how the courts apply the reasonable expectation of privacy test to computers turns next to how the exceptions to the warrant requirement apply in cases involving computers and concludes with a comprehensive discussion of the difficult Fourth Amendment issues raised by warrantless workplace searches of computers Questions addressed in this chapter include When does the government need a search warrant to search and seize a suspect s computer Can an investigator search without a warrant through a suspect s pager found incident to arrest Does the government need a warrant to search a government employee s desktop computer located in the employee s office Chapter 2 discusses the law that governs the search and seizure of computers pursuant to search warrants The chapter begins by reviewing the steps that investigators should follow when planning and executing searches to seize computer hardware and computer data with a warrant In particular the chapter focuses on two issues first how investigators should plan to execute computer searches and second how they should draft the proposed search warrants and their accompanying affidavits Finally the chapter ends with a discussion of post search issues Questions addressed in the chapter include When should investigators plan to search computers on the premises and when should they remove the computer hardware and search it later off site How should investigators plan their searches to avoid civil liability under the Privacy Protection Act 42 U S C 2000aa How should prosecutors draft search warrant language so that it complies with the particularity requirement of the Fourth Amendment and Rule 41 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure What is the law governing when the government must search and return seized computers The focus of Chapter 3 is the stored communications portion of the Electronic Communications Privacy Act 18 U S C 2701 12 ECPA ECPA governs how investigators can obtain stored account records and contents from network service providers including Internet service providers ISPs telephone companies cell phone service providers and satellite services ECPA issues arise often in cases involving the Internet any time investigators seek stored information concerning Internet accounts from providers of Internet service they must comply with the statute This chapter includes amendments to ECPA specified by the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001 Pub L No 107 56 115 Stat 272 2001 the PATRIOT Act The PATRIOT Act clarified and updated ECPA in light of modern technologies and in several respects it eased restrictions on law enforcement access to stored communications Topics covered in this section include How can the government obtain e mails and network account logs from ISPs When does the government need to obtain a search warrant as opposed to 18 U S C 2703 d order or a subpoena When can providers disclose e mails and records to the government voluntarily What remedies will courts impose when ECPA has been violated Chapter 4 reviews the legal framework that governs electronic surveillance with particular emphasis on how the statutes apply to surveillance on the communications networks In particular the chapter discusses Title III as modified by the Electronic Communications Privacy Act 18 U S C 2510 22 referred to here as Title III N 1 1 as well as the Pen Register and Trap and Trace Devices statute 18 U S C 3121 27 This chapter also includes amendments to these statutes specified by the PATRIOT Act These statutes govern when and how the government can conduct real time surveillance such as monitoring a computer hacker s activity as he breaks into a government computer network Topics addressed in this chapter include When can victims of computer crime monitor unauthorized intrusions into their networks and disclose that information to law enforcement Can network banners generate implied consent to monitoring How can the government obtain a pen register trap and trace order that permits the government to collect packet header information from Internet communications What remedies will courts impose when the electronic surveillance statutes have been violated Of course the issues discussed in Chapters 1 through 4 can overlap in actual cases An investigation into computer hacking may begin with obtaining stored records from an ISP according to Chapter 3 move next to an electronic surveillance phase implicating Chapter 4 and then conclude with a search of the suspect s residence and a seizure of his computers according to Chapters 1 and 2 In other cases agents and prosecutors must understand issues raised in multiple chapters not just in the same case but at the same time For example an investigation into workplace misconduct by a government employee may implicate all of Chapters 1 through 4 Investigators may want to obtain the employee s e mails from the government network server implicating ECPA discussed in Chapter 3 may wish to monitor the employee s use of the telephone or Internet in real time raising surveillance issues from Chapter 4 and at the same time may need to search the employee s desktop computer in his office for clues of the misconduct raising search and seizure issues from Chapters 1 and 2 Because the constitutional and statutory regimes can overlap in certain cases agents and prosecutors will need to understand not only all of the legal issues covered in Chapters 1 through 4 but will also need to understand the precise nature of the information to be gathered in their particular cases Chapters 1 through 4 are followed by a short Chapter 5 which discusses evidentiary issues that arise frequently in computer related cases The publication concludes with appendices that offer sample forms language and orders Computer crime investigations raise many novel issues and the courts have only begun to interpret how the Fourth Amendment and federal statutory laws apply to computer related cases Agents and prosecutors who need more detailed advice can rely on several resources for further assistance At the federal district level every United States Attorney s Office has at least one Assistant U S Attorney who has been designated as a Computer and Telecommunications Coordinator CTC Every CTC receives extensive training in computer related crime and is primarily responsible for providing expertise relating to the topics covered in this manual within his or her district CTCs may be reached in their district offices Further several sections within the Criminal Division of the United States Department of Justice in Washington D C have expertise in computer related fields The Office of International Affairs 202 514 0000 provides expertise in the many computer crime investigations that raise international issues The Office of Enforcement Operations 202 514 6809 provides expertise in the wiretapping laws and other privacy statutes discussed in Chapters 3 and 4 Also the Child Exploitation and Obscenity Section 202 514 5780 provides expertise in computer related cases involving child pornography and child exploitation Finally agents and prosecutors are always welcome to contact the Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section CCIPS directly both for general advice and specific case related assistance During regular business hours at least two CCIPS attorneys are on duty to answer questions and provide assistance to agents and prosecutors on the topics covered in this document as well as other matters that arise in computer crime cases The main number for CCIPS is 202 514 1026 After hours CCIPS can be reached through the Justice Command Center at 202 514 5000 toc Table of Contents I SEARCHING AND SEIZING COMPUTERS WITHOUT A WARRANT A Introduction The Fourth Amendment limits the ability of government agents to search for evidence without a warrant This chapter explains the constitutional limits of warrantless searches in cases involving computers The Fourth Amendment states The right of the people to be secure in their persons houses papers and effects against unreasonable searches and seizures shall not be violated and no Warrants shall issue but upon probable cause supported by Oath or affirmation and particularly describing the place to be searched and the persons or things to be seized According to the Supreme Court a warrantless search does not violate the Fourth Amendment if one of two conditions is satisfied First if the government s conduct does not violate a person s reasonable expectation of privacy then formally it does not constitute a Fourth Amendment search and no warrant is required See Illinois v Andreas 463 U S 765 771 1983 Second a warrantless search that violates a person s reasonable expectation of privacy will nonetheless be reasonable and therefore constitutional if it falls within an established exception to the warrant requirement See Illinois v Rodriguez 497 U S 177 185 1990 Accordingly investigators must consider two issues when asking whether a government search of a computer requires a warrant First does the search violate a reasonable expectation of privacy And if so is the search nonetheless reasonable because it falls within an exception to the warrant requirement toc Table of Contents B The Fourth Amendment s Reasonable Expectation of Privacy in Cases Involving Computers 1 General Principles A search is constitutional if it does not violate a person s reasonable or legitimate expectation of privacy Katz v United States 389 U S 347 362 1967 Harlan J concurring This inquiry embraces two discrete questions first whether the individual s conduct reflects an actual subjective expectation of privacy and second whether the individual s subjective expectation of privacy is one that society is prepared to recognize as reasonable Id at 361 In most cases the difficulty of contesting a defendant s subjective expectation of privacy focuses the analysis on the objective aspect of the Katz test i e whether the individual s expectation of privacy was reasonable No bright line rule indicates whether an expectation of privacy is constitutionally reasonable See O Connor v Ortega 480 U S 709 715 1987 For example the Supreme Court has held that a person has a reasonable expectation of privacy in property located inside a person s home see Payton v New York 445 U S 573 589 90 1980 in the relative heat of various rooms in the home revealed through the use of a thermal imager see Kyllo v United States 533 U S 27 2001 in conversations taking place in an enclosed phone booth see Katz 389 U S at 358 and in the contents of opaque containers see United States v Ross 456 U S 798 822 23 1982 In contrast a person does not have a reasonable expectation of privacy in activities conducted in open fields see Oliver v United States 466 U S 170 177 1984 in garbage deposited at the outskirts of real property see California v Greenwood 486 U S 35 40 41 1988 or in a stranger s house that the person has entered without the owner s consent in order to commit a theft see Rakas v Illinois 439 U S 128 143 n 12 1978 2 Reasonable Expectation of Privacy in Computers as Storage Devices To determine whether an individual has a reasonable expectation of privacy in information stored in a computer it helps to treat the computer like a closed container such as a briefcase or file cabinet The Fourth Amendment generally prohibits law enforcement from accessing and viewing information stored in a computer without a warrant if it would be prohibited from opening a closed container and examining its contents in the same situation The most basic Fourth Amendment question in computer cases asks whether an individual enjoys a reasonable expectation of privacy in electronic information stored within computers or other electronic storage devices under the individual s control For example do individuals have a reasonable expectation of privacy in the contents of their laptop computers floppy disks or pagers If the answer is yes then the government ordinarily must obtain a warrant before it accesses the information stored inside When confronted with this issue courts have analogized electronic storage devices to closed containers and have reasoned that accessing the information stored within an electronic storage device is akin to opening a closed container Because individuals generally retain a reasonable expectation of privacy in the contents of closed containers see United States v Ross 456 U S 798 822 23 1982 they also generally retain a reasonable expectation of privacy in data held within electronic storage devices Accordingly accessing information stored in a computer ordinarily will implicate the owner s reasonable expectation of privacy in the information See United States v Barth 26 F Supp 2d 929 936 37 W D Tex 1998 finding reasonable expectation of privacy in files stored on hard drive of personal computer United States v Reyes 922 F Supp 818 832 33 S D N Y 1996 finding reasonable expectation of privacy in data stored in a pager United States v Lynch 908 F Supp 284 287 D V I 1995 same United States v Chan 830 F Supp 531 535 N D Cal 1993 same United States v Blas 1990 WL 265179 at 21 E D Wis Dec 4 1990 A n individual has the same expectation of privacy in a pager computer or other electronic data storage and retrieval device as in a closed container Although courts have generally agreed that electronic storage devices can be analogized to closed containers they have reached differing conclusions over whether each individual file stored on a computer or disk should be treated as a separate closed container In two cases the Fifth Circuit has determined that a computer disk containing multiple files is a single container for Fourth Amendment purposes First in United States v Runyan 275 F 3d 449 464 65 5th Cir 2001 in which private parties had searched certain files and found child pornography the Fifth Circuit held that the police did not exceed the scope of the private search when they examined additional files on any disk that had been in part privately searched Analogizing a disk to a closed container the court explained that police do not exceed the private search when they examine more items within a closed container than did the private searchers Id at 464 Second in United States v Slanina 283 F 3d 670 680 5th Cir 2002 the court held that when a warrantless search of a portion of a computer and zip disk had been justified the defendant no longer retained any reasonable expectation of privacy in the remaining contents of the computer and disk and thus a comprehensive search by law enforcement personnel did not violate the Fourth Amendment In contrast to the Fifth Circuit s approach the Tenth Circuit has refused to allow such exhaustive searches of a computer s hard in the absence of a warrant or some exception to the warrant requirement See United States v Carey 172 F 3d 1268 1273 75 10th Cir 1999 ruling that agent exceeded the scope of a warrant to search for evidence of drug sales when he abandoned that search and instead searched for evidence of child pornography for five hours In particular the Tenth Circuit cautioned in a later case that b ecause computers can hold so much information touching on many different areas of a person s life there is greater potential for the intermingling of documents and a consequent invasion of privacy when police execute a search for evidence on a computer United States v Walser 275 F 3d 981 986 10th Cir 2001 Although individuals generally retain a reasonable expectation of privacy in computers under their control special circumstances may eliminate that expectation For example an individual will not retain a reasonable expectation of privacy in information from a computer that the person has made openly available In United States v David 756 F Supp 1385 D Nev 1991 agents looking over the defendant s shoulder read the defendant s password from the screen as the defendant typed his password into a handheld computer The court found no Fourth Amendment violation in obtaining the password because the defendant did not enjoy a reasonable expectation of privacy in the display that appeared on the screen Id at 1389 See also Katz v United States 389 U S 347 351 1967 What a person knowingly exposes to the public even in his own home or office is not a subject of Fourth Amendment protection United States v Gorshkov 2001 WL 1024026 at 2 W D Wash May 23 2001 holding that defendant did not have a reasonable expectation of privacy in use of a private computer network when undercover federal agents looked over his shoulder when he did not own the computer he used and when he knew that the system administrator could monitor his activities Nor will individuals generally enjoy a reasonable expectation of privacy in the contents of computers they have stolen See United States v Lyons 992 F 2d 1029 1031 32 10th Cir 1993 3 Reasonable Expectation of Privacy and Third Party Possession Individuals who retain a reasonable expectation of privacy in stored electronic information under their control may lose Fourth Amendment protections when they relinquish that control to third parties For example an individual may offer a container of electronic information to a third party by bringing a malfunctioning computer to a repair shop or by shipping a floppy diskette in the mail to a friend Alternatively a user may transmit information to third parties electronically such as by sending data across the Internet When law enforcement agents learn of information possessed by third parties that may provide evidence of a crime they may wish to inspect it Whether the Fourth Amendment requires them to obtain a warrant before examining the information depends first upon whether the third party possession has eliminated the individual s reasonable expectation of privacy To analyze third party possession issues it helps first to distinguish between possession by a carrier in the course of transmission to an intended recipient and subsequent possession by the intended recipient For example if A hires B to carry a package to C A s reasonable expectation of privacy in the contents of the package during the time that B carries the package on its way to C may be different than A s reasonable expectation of privacy after C has received the package During transmission contents generally retain Fourth Amendment protection The government ordinarily may not examine the contents of a package in the course of transmission without a warrant Government intrusion and examination of the contents ordinarily violates the reasonable expectation of privacy of both the sender and receiver See United States v Villarreal 963 F 2d 770 774 5th Cir 1992 but see United States v Walker 20 F Supp 2d 971 973 74 S D W Va 1998 concluding that packages sent to an alias in furtherance of a criminal scheme do not support a reasonable expectation of privacy This rule applies regardless of whether the carrier is owned by the government or a private company Compare Ex Parte Jackson 96 U S 6 Otto 727 733 1877 public carrier with Walter v United States 447 U S 649 651 1980 private carrier A government search of an intangible electronic signal in the course of transmission may also implicate the Fourth Amendment See Berger v New York 388 U S 41 58 60 1967 applying the Fourth Amendment to a wire communication in the context of a wiretap The boundaries of the Fourth Amendment in such cases remain hazy however because Congress addressed the Fourth Amendment concerns identified in Berger by passing Title III of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 Title III 18 U S C 2510 2522 Title III which is discussed fully in Chapter 4 provides a comprehensive statutory framework that regulates real time monitoring of wire and electronic communications Its scope encompasses and in many significant ways exceeds the protection offered by the Fourth Amendment See United States v Torres 751 F 2d 875 884 7th Cir 1985 Chandler v United States Army 125 F 3d 1296 1298 9th Cir 1997 As a practical matter then the monitoring of wire and electronic communications in the course of transmission generally raises many statutory questions but few constitutional ones See generally Chapter 4 Individuals may lose Fourth Amendment protection in their computer files if they lose control of the files Once an item has been received by the intended recipient the sender s reasonable expectation of privacy generally depends upon whether the sender can reasonably expect to retain control over the item and its contents When a person leaves a package with a third party for temporary safekeeping for example he usually retains control of the package and thus retains a reasonable expectation of privacy in its contents See e g United States v Most 876 F 2d 191 197 98 D C Cir 1989 finding reasonable expectation of privacy in contents of plastic bag left with grocery store clerk United States v Barry 853 F 2d 1479 1481 83 8th Cir 1988 finding reasonable expectation of privacy in locked suitcase stored at airport baggage counter United States v Presler 610 F 2d 1206 1213 14 4th Cir 1979 finding reasonable expectation of privacy in locked briefcases stored with defendant s friend for safekeeping See also United States v Barth 26 F Supp 2d 929 936 37 W D Tex 1998 holding that defendant retains a reasonable expectation of privacy in computer files contained in hard drive left with computer technician for limited purpose of repairing computer If the sender cannot reasonably expect to retain control over the item in the third party s possession however the sender no longer retains a reasonable expectation of privacy in its contents For example in United States v Horowitz 806 F 2d 1222 4th Cir 1986 the defendant e mailed confidential pricing information relating to his employer to his employer s competitor After the FBI searched the competitor s computers and found the pricing information the defendant claimed that the search violated his Fourth Amendment rights The Fourth Circuit disagreed holding that the defendant relinquished his interest in and control over the information by sending it to the competitor for the competitor s future use See id at 1225 26 See also United States v Charbonneau 979 F Supp 1177 1184 S D Ohio 1997 holding that defendant does not retain reasonable expectation of privacy in contents of e mail message sent to America Online chat room after the message has been received by chat room participants citing Hoffa v United States 385 U S 293 302 1966 In some cases the sender may initially retain a right to control the third party s possession but may lose that right over time The general rule is that the sender s Fourth Amendment rights dissipate as the sender s right to control the third party s possession diminishes For example in United States v Poulsen 41 F 3d 1330 9th Cir 1994 computer hacker Kevin Poulsen left computer tapes in a locker at a commercial storage facility but neglected to pay rent for the locker Following a warrantless search of the facility the government sought to use the tapes against Poulsen The Ninth Circuit held that the search did not violate Poulsen s reasonable expectation of privacy because under state law Poulsen s failure to pay rent extinguished his right to access the tapes See id at 1337 An important line of Supreme Court cases states that individuals generally cannot reasonably expect to retain control over mere information revealed to third parties even if the senders have a subjective expectation that the third parties will keep the information confidential For example in United States v Miller 425 U S 435 443 1976 the Court held that the Fourth Amendment does not protect bank account information that account holders divulge to their banks By placing information under the control of a third party the Court stated an account holder assumes the risk that the information will be conveyed to the government Id According to the Court the Fourth Amendment does not prohibit the obtaining of information revealed to a third party and conveyed by him to Government authorities even if the information is revealed on the assumption that it will be used only for a limited purpose and the confidence placed in the third party will not be betrayed Id citing Hoffa v United States 385 U S 293 302 1966 See also Smith v Maryland 442 U S 735 743 44 1979 finding no reasonable expectation of privacy in phone numbers dialed by owner of a telephone because act of dialing the number effectively tells the number to the phone company Couch v United States 409 U S 322 335 1973 holding that government may subpoena accountant for client information given to accountant by client because client retains no reasonable expectation of privacy in information given to accountant Because computer data is information this line of cases suggests that individuals who send data over communications networks may lose Fourth Amendment protection in the data once it reaches the intended recipient See United States v Meriwether 917 F 2d 955 959 6th Cir 1990 suggesting that an electronic message sent via a pager is information under the Smith Miller line of cases Charbonneau 979 F Supp at 1184 A n e mail message cannot be afforded a reasonable expectation of privacy once that message is received But see C Ryan Reetz Note Warrant Requirement for Searches of Computerized Information 67 B U L Rev 179 200 06 1987 arguing that certain kinds of remotely stored computer files should retain Fourth Amendment protection and attempting to distinguish United States v Miller and Smith v Maryland Of course the absence of constitutional protections does not necessarily mean that the government can access the data without a warrant or court order Statutory protections exist that generally protect the privacy of electronic communications stored remotely with service providers and can protect the privacy of Internet users when the Fourth Amendment may not See 18 U S C 2701 2712 discussed in Chapter 3 infra Defendants will occasionally raise a Fourth Amendment challenge to the acquisition of account records and subscriber information held by Internet service providers using less process than a full search warrant As discussed in a later chapter the Electronic Communications Privacy Act permits the government to obtain transactional records with an articulable facts court order and basic subscriber information with a subpoena See 18 U S C 2701 2712 discussed in Chapter 3 infra These statutory procedures comply with the Fourth Amendment because customers of Internet service providers do not have a reasonable expectation of privacy in customer account records maintained by and for the provider s business See United States v Hambrick 55 F Supp 2d 504 508 W D Va 1999 aff d 225 F 3d 656 4th Cir 2000 unpublished opinion finding no Fourth Amendment protection for network account holder s basic subscriber information obtained from Internet service provider United States v Kennedy 81 F Supp 2d 1103 1110 D Kan 2000 same This rule accords with prior cases considering the scope of Fourth Amendment protection in customer account records See e g United States v Fregoso 60 F 3d 1314 1321 8th Cir 1995 holding that a telephone company customer has no reasonable expectation of privacy in account information disclosed to the telephone company In re Grand Jury Proceedings 827 F 2d 301 302 03 8th Cir 1987 holding that customer account records maintained and held by Western Union are not entitled to Fourth Amendment protection 4 Private Searches The Fourth Amendment does not apply to searches conducted by private parties who are not acting as agents of the government The Fourth Amendment is wholly inapplicable to a search or seizure even an unreasonable one effected by a private individual not acting as an agent of the Government or with the participation or knowledge of any governmental official United States v Jacobsen 466 U S 109 113 1984 internal quotation omitted As a result no violation of the Fourth Amendment occurs when a private individual acting on his own accord conducts a search and makes the results available to law enforcement See id For example in United States v Hall 142 F 3d 988 7th Cir 1998 the defendant took his computer to a private computer specialist for repairs In the course of evaluating the defendant s computer the repairman observed that many files stored on the computer had filenames characteristic of child pornography The repairman accessed the files saw that they did in fact contain child pornography and then contacted the state police The tip led to a warrant the defendant s arrest and his conviction for child pornography offenses On appeal the Seventh Circuit rejected the defendant s claim that the repairman s warrantless search through the computer violated the Fourth Amendment Because the repairman s search was conducted on his own the court held the Fourth Amendment did not apply to the search or his later description of the evidence to the state police See id at 993 See also United States v Kennedy 81 F Supp 2d 1103 1112 D Kan 2000 concluding that searches of defendant s computer over the Internet by an anonymous caller and employees of a private ISP did not violate Fourth Amendment because there was no evidence that the government was involved in the search In United States v Jacobsen 466 U S 109 1984 the Supreme Court presented the framework that should guide agents seeking to uncover evidence as a result of a private search According to Jacobsen agents who learn of evidence via a private search can reenact the original private search without violating any reasonable expectation of privacy What the agents cannot do without a warrant is exceed the scope of the private search Id at 115 See also United States v Miller 152 F 3d 813 815 16 8th Cir 1998 United States v Donnes 947 F 2d 1430 1434 10th Cir 1991 But see United States v Allen 106 F 3d 695 699 6th Cir 1999 dicta stating in dicta that Jacobsen does not permit law enforcement to reenact a private search of a private home or residence This standard requires agents to limit their investigation to the scope of the private search when searching without a warrant after a private search has occurred So long as the agents limit themselves to the scope of the private search the agents search will not violate the Fourth Amendment However as soon as agents exceed the scope of the private warrantless search any evidence uncovered may be vulnerable to a motion to suppress In computer cases law enforcement use of the private search doctrine will depend in part on whether law enforcement examination of files not examined during the private search is seen as exceeding the scope of the private warrantless search See United States v Runyan 275 F 3d 449 464 65 5th Cir 2001 holding that police did not exceed the scope of a private search when they examined more files on privately searched disks than had the private searchers Under the approach adopted by the Fifth Circuit in Runyan a third party search of a single file on a computer allows a warrantless search by law enforcement of the computer s entire contents Other courts however may reject the Fifth Circuit s approach and rule that government searchers can view only those files whose contents were revealed in the private search See United States v Barth 26 F Supp 2d 929 937 W D Tex 1998 holding in a pre Runyan case that agents who viewed more files than private searcher exceeded the scope of the private search Even if courts follow the more restrictive approach the information gleaned from the private search will often be useful in providing the probable cause needed to obtain a warrant for a further search N 2 2 Although most private search issues arise when private third parties intentionally examine property and offer evidence of a crime to law enforcement the same framework applies when third parties inadvertently expose evidence of a crime to plain view For example in United States v Procopio 88 F 3d 21 1st Cir 1996 a defendant stored incriminating files in his brother s safe Later thieves stole the safe opened it and abandoned it in a public park Police investigating the theft of the safe found the files scattered on the ground nearby gathered them and then used them against the defendant in an unrelated case The First Circuit held that the use of the files did not violate the Fourth Amendment because the files were made openly available by the thieves private search See id at 26 27 citing Jacobsen 466 U S at 113 Importantly the fact that the person conducting a search is not a government employee does not always mean that the search is private for Fourth Amendment purposes A search by a private party will be considered a Fourth Amendment government search if the private party act s as an instrument or agent of the Government Skinner v Railway Labor Executives Ass n 489 U S 602 614 1989 The Supreme Court has offered little guidance on when private conduct can be attributed to the government the Court has merely stated that this question necessarily turns on the degree of the Government s participation in the private party s activities a question that can only be resolved in light of all the circumstances Id at 614 15 quoting Coolidge v New Hampshire 403 U S 443 487 1971 In the absence of a more definitive standard the various federal Courts of Appeals have adopted a range of approaches for distinguishing between private and government searches About half of the circuits apply a totality of the circumstances approach that examines three factors whether the government knows of or acquiesces in the intrusive conduct whether the party performing the search intends to assist law enforcement efforts at the time of the search and whether the government affirmatively encourages initiates or instigates the private action See e g United States v Pervaz 118 F 3d 1 6 1st Cir 1997 United States v Smythe 84 F 3d 1240 1242 43 10th Cir 1996 United States v McAllister 18 F 3d 1412 1417 18 7th Cir 1994 United States v Malbrough 922 F 2d 458 462 8th Cir 1990 Other circuits have adopted more rule like formulations that focus on only two of these factors See e g United States v Miller 688 F 2d 652 657 9th Cir 1982 holding that private action counts as government conduct if at the time of the search the government knew of or acquiesced in the intrusive conduct and the party performing the search intended to assist law enforcement efforts United States v Paige 136 F 3d 1012 1017 5th Cir 1998 same United States v Lambert 771 F 2d 83 89 6th Cir 1985 holding that a private individual is a state actor for Fourth Amendment purposes if the police instigated encouraged or participated in the search and the individual engaged in the search with the intent of assisting the police in their investigative efforts 5 Use of Technology to Obtain Information The government s use of innovative technology to obtain information about a target can implicate the Fourth Amendment See Kyllo v United States 533 U S 27 2001 In Kyllo the Supreme Court held that the warrantless use of a thermal imager to reveal the relative amount of heat released from the various rooms of a suspect s home was a search that violated the Fourth Amendment In particular the Court held that where law enforcement uses a device that is not in general public use to explore details of the home that would previously have been unknowable without a physical intrusion the surveillance is a search and is presumptively unreasonable without a warrant Id at 40 Use by the government of innovative technology not in general public use to obtain information stored on or transmitted through computers or networks may implicate this rule from Kyllo and thus may require a warrant Whether a technology falls within the scope of the Kyllo rule depends on at least two factors First the use of technology should not implicate Kyllo if the technology is in general public use see id at 34 39 n 6 although courts have not yet defined the standard for determining whether a given technology meets this requirement Second the Supreme Court restricted its holding in Kyllo to the use of technology to reveal information about the interior of the home See id at 40 We have said that the Fourth Amendment draws a firm line at the entrance to the house internal citation omitted toc Table of Contents C Exceptions to the Warrant Requirement in Cases Involving Computers Warrantless searches that violate a reasonable expectation of privacy will comply with the Fourth Amendment if they fall within an established exception to the warrant requirement Cases involving computers often raise questions relating to how these established exceptions apply to new technologies 1 Consent Agents may search a place or object without a warrant or even probable cause if a person with authority has voluntarily consented to the search See Schneckloth v Bustamonte 412 U S 218 219 1973 This consent may be explicit or implicit See United States v Milian Rodriguez 759 F 2d 1558 1563 64 11th Cir 1985 Whether consent was voluntarily given is a question of fact that the court must decide by considering the totality of the circumstances While no single aspect controls the result the Supreme Court has identified the following important factors the age education intelligence physical and mental condition of the person giving consent whether the person was under arrest and whether the person had been advised of his right to refuse consent See Schneckloth 412 U S at 226 The government carries the burden of proving that consent was voluntary See United States v Matlock 415 U S 164 177 1974 United States v Price 599 F 2d 494 503 2d Cir 1979 In computer crime cases two consent issues arise particularly often First when does a search exceed the scope of consent For example when a target consents to the search of a machine to what extent does the consent authorize the retrieval of information stored in the machine Second who is the proper party to consent to a search Do roommates friends and parents have the authority to consent to a search of another person s computer files N 3 3 a Scope of Consent The scope of a consent to search is generally defined by its expressed object and is limited by the breadth of the consent given United States v Pena 143 F 3d 1363 1368 10th Cir 1998 internal quotation omitted The standard for measuring the scope of consent under the Fourth Amendment is objective reasonableness What would the typical reasonable person have understood by the exchange between the agent and the person granting consent Florida v Jimeno 500 U S 248 251 1991 This requires a fact intensive inquiry into whether it was reasonable for the agent to believe that the scope of consent included the items searched Id Of course when the limits of the consent are clearly given either before or during the search agents must respect these bounds See Vaughn v Baldwin 950 F 2d 331 333 6th Cir 1991 The permitted scope of consent searches depends on the facts of each case Computer cases often raise the question of whether consent to search a location or item implicitly includes consent to access the memory of electronic storage devices encountered during the search In such cases courts look to whether the particular circumstances of the agents request for consent implicitly or explicitly limited the scope of the search to a particular type scope or duration Because this approach ultimately relies on fact driven notions of common sense results reached in published opinions have hinged upon subtle if not entirely inscrutable distinctions Compare United States v Reyes 922 F Supp 818 834 S D N Y 1996 holding that consent to look inside a car included consent to retrieve numbers stored inside pagers found in car s back seat with United States v Blas 1990 WL 265179 at 20 E D Wis Dec 4 1990 holding that consent to look at a pager did not include consent to activate pager and retrieve numbers because looking at pager could be construed to mean what the device is or how small it is or what brand of pager it may be See also United States v Carey 172 F 3d 1268 1274 10th Cir 1999 reading written consent form extremely narrowly so that consent to seizure of any property under the defendant s control and to a complete search of the premises and property at the defendant s address merely permitted the agents to seize the defendant s computer from his apartment not to search the computer off site because it was no longer located at the defendant s address Prosecutors can strengthen their argument that the scope of consent included consent to search electronic storage devices by relying on analogous cases involving closed containers See e g United States v Galante 1995 WL 507249 at 3 S D N Y Aug 25 1995 holding that general consent to search car included consent to have officer access memory of cellular telephone found in the car relying on circuit precedent involving closed containers Reyes 922 F Supp at 834 Agents should be especially careful about relying on consent as the basis for a search of a computer when they obtain consent for one reason but then wish to conduct a search for another reason In two recent cases the Courts of Appeals suppressed images of child pornography found on computers after agents procured the defendant s consent to search his property for other evidence In United States v Turner 169 F 3d 84 1st Cir 1999 detectives searching for physical evidence of an attempted sexual assault obtained written consent from the victim s neighbor to search the neighbor s premises and personal property Before the neighbor signed the consent form the detectives discovered a large knife and blood stains in his apartment and explained to him that they were looking for more evidence of the assault that the suspect might have left behind See id at 86 While several agents searched for physical evidence one detective searched the contents of the neighbor s personal computer and discovered stored images of child pornography The neighbor was charged with possessing child pornography On interlocutory appeal the First Circuit held that the search of the computer exceeded the scope of consent and suppressed the evidence According to the Court the detectives statements that they were looking for signs of the assault limited the scope of consent to the kind of physical evidence that an intruder might have left behind See id at 88 By transforming the search for physical evidence into a search for computer files the detective had exceeded the scope of consent See id See also Carey 172 F 3d at 1277 Baldock J concurring concluding that agents exceeded scope of consent by searching computer after defendant signed broadly worded written consent form because agents told defendant that they were looking for drugs and drug related items rather than computer files containing child pornography citing Turner It is a good practice for agents to use written consent forms that state explicitly that the scope of consent includes consent to search computers and other electronic storage devices Because the decisions evaluating the scope of consent to search computers have reached sometimes unpredictable results investigators should indicate the scope of the search explicitly when obtaining a suspect s consent to search a computer b Third Party Consent i General Rules It is common for several people to use or own the same computer equipment If any one of those people gives permission to search for data agents may generally rely on that consent so long as the person has authority over the computer In such cases all users have assumed the risk that a co user might discover everything in the computer and might also permit law enforcement to search this common area as well The watershed case in this area is United States v Matlock 415 U S 164 1974 In Matlock the Supreme Court stated that one who has common authority over premises or effects may consent to a search even if an absent co user objects Id at 171 According to the Court the common authority that establishes the right of third party consent requires mutual use of the property by persons generally having joint access or control for most purposes so that it is reasonable to recognize that any of the co inhabitants has the right to permit the inspection in his own right and that the others have assumed the risk that one of their number might permit the common area to be searched Id at 171 n 7 Under the Matlock approach a private third party may consent to a search of property under the third party s joint access or control Agents may view what the third party may see without violating any reasonable expectation of privacy so long as they limit the search to the zone of the consenting third party s common authority See United States v Jacobsen 466 U S 109 119 1984 noting that the Fourth Amendment is not violated when a private third party invites the government to view the contents of a package under the third party s control This rule often requires agents to inquire into third parties s rights of access before conducting a consent search and to draw lines between those areas that fall within the third party s common authority and those areas outside of the third party s control See United States v Block 590 F 2d 535 541 4th Cir 1978 holding that a mother could consent to a general search of her 23 year old son s room but could not consent to a search of a locked footlocker found in the room Because the joint access test does not require a unity of interests between the suspect and the third party however Matlock permits third party consent even when the target of the search is present and refuses to consent to the search See United States v Sumlin 567 F 2d 684 687 88 6th Cir 1977 holding that woman had authority to consent to search of apartment she shared with her boyfriend even though boyfriend refused consent Co users of a computer will generally have the ability to consent to a search of its files under Matlock See United States v Smith 27 F Supp 2d 1111 1115 16 C D Ill 1998 concluding that a woman could consent to a search of her boyfriend s computer located in their house and noting that the boyfriend had not password protected his files However when an individual protects her files with passwords and has not shared the passwords with others who also use the computer the Fourth Circuit has held that the authority of those other users to consent to search of the computer will not extend to the password protected files See Trulock v Freeh 275 F 3d 391 403 04 4th Cir 2001 analogizing password protected files to locked footlockers inside a bedroom which the court had previously held to be outside the scope of common authority consent Conversely if the co user has been given the password by the suspect then she probably has the requisite common authority to consent to a search of the files under Matlock See United States v Murphy 506 F 2d 529 530 9th Cir 1974 per curiam concluding that an employee could consent to a search of an employer s locked warehouse because the employee possessed the key and finding special significance in the fact that the employer had himself delivered the key to the employee As a practical matter agents may have little way of knowing the precise bounds of a third party s common authority when the agents obtain third party consent to conduct a search When queried consenting third parties may falsely claim that they have common authority over property In Illinois v Rodriguez 497 U S 177 1990 the Supreme Court held that the Fourth Amendment does not automatically require suppression of evidence discovered during a consent search when it later comes to light that the third party who consented to the search lacked the authority to do so See id at 188 89 Instead the Court held that agents can rely on a claim of authority to consent if based on the facts available to the officer at the moment a man of reasonable caution would believe that the consenting party had authority to consent to a search of the premises Id internal quotations omitted quoting Terry v Ohio 392 U S 1 21 22 1968 When agents reasonably rely on apparent authority to consent the resulting search does not violate the Fourth Amendment ii Spouses and Domestic Partners Most spousal consent searches are valid Absent an affirmative showing that the consenting spouse has no access to the property searched the courts generally hold that either spouse may consent to search all of the couple s property See e g United States v Duran 957 F 2d 499 504 05 7th Cir 1992 concluding that wife could consent to search of barn she did not use because husband had not denied her the right to enter barn United States v Long 524 F 2d 660 661 9th Cir 1975 holding that wife who had left her husband could consent to search of jointly owned home even though husband had changed the locks For example in United States v Smith 27 F Supp 2d 1111 C D Ill 1998 a man named Smith was living with a woman named Ushman and her two daughters When allegations of child molestation were raised against Smith Ushman consented to the search of his computer which was located in the house in an alcove connected to the master bedroom Although Ushman used Smith s computer only rarely the district court held that she could consent to the search of Smith s computer Because Ushman was not prohibited from entering the alcove and Smith had not password protected the computer the court reasoned she had authority to consent to the search See id at 1115 16 Even if she lacked actual authority to consent the court added she had apparent authority to consent See id at 1116 citing Illinois v Rodriguez iii Parents Parents can consent to searches of their children s rooms when the children are under 18 years old If the children are 18 or older the parents may or may not be able to consent depending on the facts In some computer crime cases the perpetrators are relatively young and reside with their parents When the perpetrator is a minor parental consent to search the perpetrator s property and living space will almost always be valid See 3 W LaFave Search and Seizure A Treatise on the Fourth Amendment 8 4 b at 283 2d ed 1987 noting that courts have rejected even rather extraordinary efforts by minor child ren to establish exclusive use When the sons and daughters who reside with their parents are legal adults however the issue is more complicated Under Matlock it is clear that parents may consent to a search of common areas in the family home regardless of the perpetrator s age See e g United States v Lavin 1992 WL 373486 at 6 S D N Y Nov 30 1992 recognizing right of parents to consent to search of basement room where son kept his computer and files When agents would like to search an adult child s room or other private areas however agents cannot assume that the adult s parents have authority to consent Although courts have offered divergent approaches they have paid particular attention to three factors the suspect s age whether the suspect pays rent and whether the suspect has taken affirmative steps to deny his or her parents access to the suspect s room or private area When suspects are older pay rent and or deny access to parents courts have generally held that parents may not consent See United States v Whitfield 939 F 2d 1071 1075 D C Cir 1991 holding cursory questioning of suspect s mother insufficient to establish right to consent to search of 29 year old son s room United States v Durham 1998 WL 684241 at 4 D Kan Sept 11 1998 mother had neither apparent nor actual authority to consent to search of 24 year old son s room because son had changed the locks to the room without telling his mother and son also paid rent for the room In contrast parents usually may consent if their adult children do not pay rent are fairly young and have taken no steps to deny their parents access to the space to be searched See United States v Rith 164 F 3d 1323 1331 10th Cir 1999 suggesting that parents are presumed to have authority to consent to a search of their 18 year old son s room because he did not pay rent United States v Block 590 F 2d 535 541 4th Cir 1978 mother could consent to police search of 23 year old son s room when son did not pay rent iv System Administrators Every computer network is managed by a system administrator or system operator whose job is to keep the network running smoothly monitor security and repair the network when problems arise System operators have root level access to the systems they administer which effectively grants them master keys to open any account and read any file on their systems When investigators suspect that a network account contains relevant evidence they may feel inclined to seek the system administrator s consent to search the contents of that account As a practical matter the primary barrier to searching a network account pursuant to a system administrator s consent is statutory not constitutional System administrators typically serve as agents of provider s of electronic communication service under the Electronic Communications Privacy Act ECPA 18 U S C 2701 2712 ECPA regulates law enforcement efforts to obtain the consent of a system administrator to search an individual s account See 18 U S C 2702 2703 Accordingly any attempt to obtain a system administrator s consent to search an account must comply with ECPA Seegenerally Chapter 3 The Electronic Communications Privacy Act infra To the extent that ECPA authorizes system administrators to consent to searches the resulting consent searches will in most cases comply with the Fourth Amendment Most fundamentally it may be that individuals retain no reasonable expectation of privacy in the remotely stored files and records that their network accounts contain See generally Chapter I B 3 supra If an individual does not retain a constitutionally reasonable expectation of privacy in his remotely stored files it will not matter whether the system administrator has the necessary joint control over the account needed to satisfy the Matlock test because a subsequent search will not violate the Fourth Amendment In the event that a court holds that an individual does possess a reasonable expectation of privacy in remotely stored account files whether a system administrator s consent would satisfy Matlock would depend on the circumstances Clearly the system administrator s access to all network files does not by itself provide the common authority that triggers authority to consent In the pre Matlock case of Stoner v California 376 U S 483 1964 the Supreme Court held that a hotel clerk lacked the authority to consent to the search of a hotel room Although the clerk was permitted to enter the room to perform his duties and the guest had left his room key with the clerk the Court concluded that the clerk could not consent to the search If the hotel guest s protection from unreasonable searches and seizures were left to depend on the unfettered discretion of an employee of the hotel Justice Stewart reasoned it would disappear Id at 490 See also Chapman v United States 365 U S 610 1961 holding that a landlord lacks authority to consent to search of premises used by tenant United States v Most 876 F 2d 191 199 200 D C Cir 1989 holding that store clerk lacks authority to consent to search of packages left with clerk for safekeeping To the extent that the access of a system operator to a network account is analogous to the access of a hotel clerk to a hotel room the claim that a system operator may consent to a search of Fourth Amendment protected files is weak Cf Barth 26 F Supp 2d at 938 holding that computer repairman s right to access files for limited purpose of repairing computer did not create authority to consent to government search through files Of course the hotel clerk analogy may be inadequate in some circumstances For example an employee generally does not have the same relationship with the system administrator of his company s network as a customer of a private ISP such as AOL might have with the ISP s system administrator The company may grant the system administrator of the company network full rights to access employee accounts for any work related reason and the employees may know that the system administrator has such access In circumstances such as this the system administrator would likely have sufficient common authority over the accounts to be able to consent to a search See generally Note Keeping Secrets in Cyberspace Establishing Fourth Amendment Protection for Internet Communication 110 Harv L Rev 1591 1602 03 1997 See also United States v Clarke 2 F 3d 81 85 4th Cir 1993 holding that a drug courier hired to transport the defendant s locked toolbox containing drugs had common authority under Matlock to consent to a search of the toolbox stored in the courier s trunk Further in the case of a government network the Fourth Amendment rules would likely differ dramatically from the rules that apply to private networks See generally O Connor v Ortega 480 U S 709 1987 explaining how the Fourth Amendment applies within government workplaces discussed infra c Implied Consent Individuals often enter into agreements with the government in which they waive some of their Fourth Amendment rights For example prison guards may agree to be searched for drugs as a condition of employment and visitors to government buildings may agree to a limited search of their person and property as a condition of entrance Similarly users of computer systems may waive their rights to privacy as a condition of using the systems When individuals who have waived their rights are then searched and challenge the searches on Fourth Amendment grounds courts typically focus on whether the waiver eliminated the individual s reasonable expectation of privacy against the search See e g American Postal Workers Union Columbus Area Local AFL CIO v United States Postal Service 871 F 2d 556 56 61 6th Cir 1989 holding that postal employees retained no reasonable expectation of privacy in government lockers after signing waivers A few courts have approached the same problem from a slightly different direction and have asked whether the waiver established implied consent to the search According to the doctrine of implied consent consent to a search may be inferred from an individual s conduct For example in United States v Ellis 547 F 2d 863 5th Cir 1977 a civilian visiting a naval air station agreed to post a visitor s pass on the windshield of his car as a condition of bringing the car on the base The pass stated that a cceptance of this pass gives your consent to search this vehicle while entering aboard or leaving this station Id at 865 n 1 During the visitor s stay on the base a station investigator who suspected that the visitor had stored marijuana in the car approached the visitor and asked him if he had read the pass After the visitor admitted that he had the investigator searched the car and found 20 plastic bags containing marijuana The Fifth Circuit ruled that the warrantless search of the car was permissible because the visitor had impliedly consented to the search when he knowingly and voluntarily entered the base with full knowledge of the terms of the visitor s pass See id at 866 67 Ellis notwithstanding it must be noted that several circuits have been critical of the implied consent doctrine in the Fourth Amendment context Despite the Fifth Circuit s broad construction other courts have proven reluctant to apply the doctrine absent evidence that the suspect actually knew of the search and voluntarily consented to it at the time the search occurred See McGann v Northeast Illinois Regional Commuter R R Corp 8 F 3d 1174 1180 7th Cir 1993 Courts confronted with claims of implied consent have been reluctant to uphold a warrantless search based simply on actions taken in the light of a posted notice Securities and Law Enforcement Employees District Council 82 v Carey 737 F 2d 187 202 n 23 2d Cir 1984 rejecting argument that prison guards impliedly consented to search by accepting employment at prison where consent to search was a condition of employment Absent such evidence these courts have preferred to examine general waivers of Fourth Amendment rights solely under the reasonable expectation of privacy test See id 2 Exigent Circumstances Under the exigent circumstances exception to the warrant requirement agents can search without a warrant if the circumstances would cause a reasonable person to believe that entry was necessary to prevent physical harm to the officers or other persons the destruction of relevant evidence the escape of the suspect or some other consequence improperly frustrating legitimate law enforcement efforts See United States v McConney 728 F 2d 1195 1199 9th Cir 1984 en banc In determining whether exigent circumstances exist agents should consider 1 the degree of urgency involved 2 the amount of time necessary to obtain a warrant 3 whether the evidence is about to be removed or destroyed 4 the possibility of danger at the site 5 information indicating the possessors of the contraband know the police are on their trail and 6 the ready destructibility of the contraband See United States v Reed 935 F 2d 641 642 4th Cir 1991 Exigent circumstances often arise in computer cases because electronic data is perishable Computer commands can destroy data in a matter of seconds as can humidity temperature physical mutilation or magnetic fields created for example by passing a strong magnet over a disk For example in United States v David 756 F Supp 1385 D Nev 1991 agents saw the defendant deleting files on his computer memo book and seized the computer immediately The district court held that the agents did not need a warrant to seize the memo book because the defendant s acts had created exigent circumstances See id at 1392 Similarly in United States v Romero Garcia 991 F Supp 1223 1225 D Or 1997 aff d on other grounds 168 F 3d 502 9th Cir 1999 a district court held that agents had properly accessed the information in an electronic pager in their possession because they had reasonably believed that it was necessary to prevent the destruction of evidence The information stored in pagers is readily destroyed the court noted incoming messages can delete stored information and batteries can die erasing the information Accordingly the agents were justified in accessing the pager without first acquiring a warrant See also United States v Gorshkov 2001 WL 1024026 at 4 W D Wash May 23 2001 concluding that circumstances justified download without a warrant of data from computer in Russia where probable cause existed that Russian computer contained evidence of crime where good reason existed to fear that delay could lead to destruction of or loss of access to evidence and where agent merely copied data and subsequently obtained search warrant United States v Ortiz 84 F 3d 977 984 7th Cir 1996 in conducting search incident to arrest agents were justified in retrieving numbers from pager because pager information is easily destroyed Of course in computer cases as in all others the existence of exigent circumstances is absolutely tied to the facts Compare Romero Garcia 911 F Supp at 1225 with David 756 F Supp at 1392 n 2 dismissing as lame the government s argument that exigent circumstances supported search of a battery operated computer because the agent did not know how much longer the computer s batteries would live and United States v Reyes 922 F Supp 818 835 36 S D N Y 1996 concluding that exigent circumstances could not justify search of a pager because the government agent unlawfully created the exigency by turning on the pager Importantly the existence of exigent circumstances does not permit agents to search or seize beyond what is necessary to prevent the destruction of the evidence When the exigency ends the right to conduct warrantless searches does as well the need to take certain steps to prevent the destruction of evidence does not authorize agents to take further steps without a warrant See United States v Doe 61 F 3d 107 110 11 1st Cir 1995 Accordingly the seizure of computer hardware to prevent the destruction of information it contains will not ordinarily support a subsequent search of that information without a warrant See David 756 F Supp at 1392 3 Plain View Evidence of a crime may be seized without a warrant under the plain view exception to the warrant requirement To rely on this exception the agent must be in a lawful position to observe and access the evidence and its incriminating character must be immediately apparent See Horton v California 496 U S 128 1990 For example if an agent conducts a valid search of a hard drive and comes across evidence of an unrelated crime while conducting the search the agent may seize the evidence under the plain view doctrine The plain view doctrine does not authorize agents to open and view the contents of a computer file that they are not otherwise authorized to open and review Importantly the plain view exception cannot justify violations of an individual s reasonable expectation of privacy The exception merely permits the seizure of evidence that an agent is already authorized to view in accordance with the Fourth Amendment In computer cases this means that the government cannot rely on the plain view exception to justify opening a closed computer file it is not otherwise authorized to view N 4 4 The contents of such a file that must be opened to be viewed are not in plain view See United States v Maxwell 45 M J 406 422 C A A F 1996 This rule accords with decisions applying the plain view exception to closed containers See e g United States v Villarreal 963 F 2d 770 776 5th Cir 1992 concluding that labels fixed to opaque 55 gallon drums do not expose the contents of the drums to plain view A label on a container is not an invitation to search it If the government seeks to learn more than the label reveals by opening the container it generally must obtain a search warrant As discussed above see Chapter I B 2 courts have reached differing conclusions over whether each individual file stored on a computer should be treated as a separate closed container and this distinction has important ramifications for the scope of the plain view exception United States v Carey 172 F 3d 1268 1273 10th Cir 1999 provides a cautionary example of the restrictive approach In Carey a police detective searching a hard drive with a warrant for drug trafficking evidence opened a jpg file and instead discovered child pornography At that point the detective spent five hours accessing and downloading several hundred jpg files in a search not for evidence of the narcotics trafficking that he was authorized to seek and gather pursuant to the original warrant but for more child pornography When the defendant moved to exclude the child pornography files on the ground that they were seized beyond the scope of the warrant the government argued that the detective had seized the jpg files properly because the contents of the contraband files were in plain view The Tenth Circuit rejected this argument with respect to all of the files except for the first jpg file the detective discovered See id at 1273 1273 n 4 As best as can be discerned the rule in Carey seems to be that the detective could seize the first jpg file that came into plain view when the detective was executing the search warrant but could not rely on the plain view exception to justify the search solely for additional jpg files containing child pornography on the defendant s computers evidence beyond the scope of the warrant Cf United States v Walser 275 F 3d 981 986 87 10th Cir 2001 finding no Fourth Amendment violation when officer with warrant to search for electronic records of drug transactions opened single computer file containing child pornography suspended search and then returned to magistrate for second warrant to search for child pornography In contrast to the Tenth Circuit s approach in Carey the doctrine set forth by the Fifth Circuit in United States v Runyan 275 F 3d 449 464 65 5th Cir 2001 and United States v Slanina 283 F 3d 670 680 5th Cir 2002 suggests that plain view of a single file on a computer or storage device could provide a basis for a more extensive search In those two cases the court held that when a warrantless search of a portion of a computer or storage device had been proper the defendant no longer retained any reasonable expectation of privacy in the remaining contents of the computer or storage device See Slanina 283 F 3d at 680 Runyan 275 F 3d at 464 65 Thus a more extensive search of the computer or storage device by law enforcement did not violate the Fourth Amendment This rationale may also apply when a file has been placed in plain view 4 Search Incident to a Lawful Arrest Pursuant to a lawful arrest agents may conduct a full search of the arrested person and a more limited search of his surrounding area without a warrant See United States v Robinson 414 U S 218 235 1973 Chimel v California 395 U S 752 762 63 1969 For example in Robinson a police officer conducting a patdown search incident to an arrest for a traffic offense discovered a crumpled cigarette package in the suspect s left breast pocket Not knowing what the package contained the officer opened the package and discovered fourteen capsules of heroin The Supreme Court held that the search of the package was permissible even though the officer had no articulable reason to open the package See id at 234 35 In light of the general need to preserve evidence and prevent harm to the arresting officer the Court reasoned it was per se reasonable for an officer to conduct a full search of the person pursuant to a lawful arrest Id at 235 Due to the increasing use of handheld and portable computers and other electronic storage devices agents often encounter computers when conducting searches incident to lawful arrests Suspects may be carrying pagers cellular telephones Personal Digital assistants such as Palm Pilots or even laptop computers when they are arrested Does the search incident to arrest exception permit an agent to access the memory of an electronic storage device found on the arrestee s person during a warrantless search incident to arrest In the case of electronic pagers the answer clearly is yes Relying on Robinson courts have uniformly permitted agents to access electronic pagers carried by the arrested person at the time of arrest See United States v Reyes 922 F Supp 818 833 S D N Y 1996 holding that accessing numbers in a pager found in bag attached to defendant s wheelchair within twenty minutes of arrest falls within search incident to arrest exception United States v Chan 830 F Supp 531 535 N D Cal 1993 United States v Lynch 908 F Supp 284 287 D V I 1995 Yu v United States 1997 WL 423070 at 2 S D N Y Jul 29 1997 United States v Thomas 114 F 3d 403 404 n 2 3d Cir 1997 dicta See also United States v Ortiz 84 F 3d 977 984 7th Cir 1996 same holding but relying on an exigency theory Courts have not yet addressed whether Robinson will permit warrantless searches of electronic storage devices that contain more information than pagers In the paper world certainly cases have allowed extensive searches of written materials discovered incident to lawful arrests For example courts have uniformly held that agents may inspect the entire contents of a suspect s wallet found on his person See e g United States v Castro 596 F 2d 674 676 5th Cir 1979 United States v Molinaro 877 F 2d 1341 1347 7th Cir 1989 citing cases Similarly one court has held that agents could photocopy the entire contents of an address book found on the defendant s person during the arrest see United States v Rodriguez 995 F 2d 776 778 7th Cir 1993 and others have permitted the search of a defendant s briefcase that was at his side at the time of arrest See e g United States v Johnson 846 F 2d 279 283 84 5th Cir 1988 United States v Lam Muk Chiu 522 F 2d 330 332 2d Cir 1975 If agents can examine the contents of wallets address books and briefcases without a warrant it could be argued that they should be able to search their electronic counterparts such as electronic organizers floppy disks and Palm Pilots as well Cf United v Tank 200 F 3d 627 632 9th Cir 2000 holding that agents searching a car incident to a valid arrest properly seized a Zip disk found in the car but failing to discuss whether the agents obtained a warrant before searching the disk for images of child pornography The limit on this argument is that any search incident to an arrest must be reasonable See Swain v Spinney 117 F 3d 1 6 1st Cir 1997 While a search of physical items found on the arrestee s person may always be reasonable more invasive searches in different circumstances may violate the Fourth Amendment See e g Mary Beth G v City of Chicago 723 F 2d 1263 1269 71 7th Cir 1983 holding that Robinson does not permit strip searches incident to arrest because such searches are not reasonable in context For example the increasing storage capacity of handheld computers suggests that Robinson s bright line rule may not always apply in the case of electronic searches When in doubt agents should consider whether to obtain a search warrant before examining the contents of electronic storage devices that might contain large amounts of information 5 Inventory Searches Law enforcement officers routinely inventory the items they have seized Such inventory searches are reasonable and therefore fall under an exception to the warrant requirement when two conditions are met First the search must serve a legitimate non investigatory purpose e g to protect an owner s property while in custody to insure against claims of lost stolen or vandalized property or to guard the police from danger that outweighs the intrusion on the individual s Fourth Amendment rights See Illinois v Lafayette 462 U S 640 644 1983 South Dakota v Opperman 428 U S 364 369 70 1976 Second the search must follow standardized procedures See Colorado v Bertine 479 U S 367 374 n 6 1987 Florida v Wells 495 U S 1 4 5 1990 It is unlikely that the inventory search exception to the warrant requirement would support a search through seized computer files See United States v O Razvi 1998 WL 405048 at 6 7 S D N Y July 17 1998 noting the difficulties of applying the inventory search requirements to computer disks see also United States v Flores 122 F Supp 2d 491 493 95 S D N Y 2000 finding search of cellular telephone purely investigatory and thus not lawful inventory search Even assuming that standard procedures authorized such a search the legitimate purposes served by inventory searches in the physical world do not translate well into the intangible realm Information does not generally need to be reviewed to be protected and does not pose a risk of physical danger Although an owner could claim that his computer files were altered or deleted while in police custody examining the contents of the files would offer little protection from tampering Accordingly agents will generally need to obtain a search warrant in order to examine seized computer files held in custody 6 Border Searches In order to protect the government s ability to monitor contraband and other property that may enter or exit the United States illegally the Supreme Court has recognized a special exception to the warrant requirement for searches that occur at the border of the United States According to the Court routine searches at the border or its functional equivalent do not require a warrant probable cause or even reasonable suspicion that the search may uncover contraband or evidence United States v Montoya De Hernandez 473 U S 531 538 1985 Searches that are especially intrusive however require at least reasonable suspicion See id at 541 These rules apply to people and property both entering and exiting the United States See United States v Oriakhi 57 F 3d 1290 1297 4th Cir 1995 In at least one case courts have addressed whether the border search exception permits a warrantless search of a computer disk for contraband computer files In United States v Roberts 86 F Supp 2d 678 S D Tex 2000 aff d on other grounds 274 F 3d 1007 5th Cir 2001 United States Customs Agents learned that William Roberts a suspect believed to be carrying computerized images of child pornography was scheduled to fly from Houston Texas to Paris France on a particular day On the day of the flight the agents set up an inspection area in the jetway at the Houston airport with the sole purpose of searching Roberts Roberts arrived at the inspection area and was told by the agents that they were searching for currency and high technology or other data that could not be exported legally Id at 681 After the agents searched Roberts property and found a laptop computer and six Zip diskettes Roberts agreed to sign a consent form permitting the agents to search his property A subsequent search revealed several thousand images of child pornography See id at 682 The district court rejected the defendant s motion to suppress the computer files holding that the search of Roberts luggage had been a routine search for which no suspicion was required even though the justification for the search offered by the agents merely had been a pretext See id at 686 688 citing Whren v United States 517 U S 806 1996 The court also concluded that Roberts consent justified the search of the laptop and diskettes and indicated that even if Roberts had not consented to the search t he search of the defendant s computer and diskettes would have been a routine export search valid under the Fourth Amendment See Roberts 98 F Supp 2d at 688 On appeal the Fifth Circuit affirmed the district court s refusal to suppress the evidence on the grounds that the initial jetway search of Roberts was justified by reasonable suspicion that Roberts possessed child pornography and that the subsequent search and seizure of computer equipment was justified by probable cause See id at 1017 The court did not reach the issue of whether the seizure of Roberts computer equipment could be considered routine Importantly agents and prosecutors should not interpret Roberts as permitting the interception of data transmitted electronically to and from the United States Any real time interception of electronically transmitted data in the United States must comply strictly with the requirements of Title III 18 U S C 2510 2522 or the Pen Trap statute 18 U S C 3121 3127 See generally Chapter 4 Further once electronically transferred data from outside the United States arrives at its destination within the United States the government ordinarily cannot rely on the border search exception to search for and seize the data because the data is no longer at the border or its functional equivalent Cf Almeida Sanchez v United States 413 U S 266 273 74 1973 concluding that a search that occurred 25 miles from the United States border did not qualify for the border search exception even though the search occurred on a highway known as a common route for illegal aliens because it did not occur at the border or its functional equivalent 7 International Issues Increasingly electronic evidence necessary to prevent investigate or prosecute a crime may be located outside the borders of the United States This can occur for several reasons Criminals can use the Internet to commit or facilitate crimes remotely e g when Russian hackers steal money from a bank in New York or when the kidnappers of an American deliver demands by e mail for release of their captive Communications also can be laundered through third countries such as when a criminal in Brooklyn uses the Internet to pass a communication through Tokyo Tel Aviv and Johannesburg before it reaches its intended recipient in Manhattan much the way monies can be laundered through banks in different countries in order to hide their source In addition provider architecture may route or store communications in the country where the provider is based regardless of the location of its users When United States authorities investigating a crime believe electronic evidence is stored by an Internet service provider or on a computer located abroad in Country A U S law enforcement usually must seek assistance from law enforcement authorities in Country A Since in general law enforcement officers exercise their functions in the territory of another country with the consent of that country U S law enforcement should only make direct contact with an ISP located in Country A with 1 prior permission of the foreign government 2 approval of DOJ s Office of International Affairs OIA which would know of particular sensitivities and or accepted practices or 3 other clear indicia that such practice would not be objectionable in Country A There is general agreement that access to publicly available materials in Country A such as those posted to a public Web site and access to materials in Country A with the consent of the owner custodian of those materials are permissible without prior consultations Under certain circumstances foreign law enforcement authorities may be able to share evidence informally with U S counterparts However finding the appropriate official in Country A with which to explore such cooperation is an inexact science at best Possible avenues for entree to foreign law enforcement are 1 the designated expert who participates in the G8 s network of international high tech crime points of contact discussed below 2 law enforcement contacts maintained by OIA 3 representatives of U S law enforcement agencies who are stationed at the relevant American Embassy e g FBI Legal Attaches or LegAtts and agents from the U S Secret Service and U S Customs Service and 4 the Regional Security Officer from the Diplomatic Security Service at the American Embassy who may have good in country law enforcement contacts OIA can be reached at 202 514 0000 Where Country A cannot otherwise provide informal assistance requests for evidence usually will be made under existing Mutual Legal Assistance Treaties MLATs or Mutual Legal Assistance Agreements or through the Letters Rogatory process See 28 U S C 1781 1782 These official requests for assistance are made by OIA to the designated Central Authority of Country A or in the absence of an MLAT to other appropriate authorities Central Authorities are usually located within the Justice Ministry or other Ministry or office in Country A that has law enforcement authority OIA has attorneys responsible for every country and region of the world Since official requests of this nature require specified documents and procedures and can take some time to produce results law enforcement should contact OIA as soon as a request for international legal assistance becomes a possibility When U S law enforcement has reason to believe that electronic evidence exists on a computer or computer network located abroad and expects a delay before that evidence is secured in Country A a request to foreign law enforcement for preservation of the evidence should be made as soon as possible Such request similar to a request under 18 U S C 2703 f to a U S provider see Chapter 3 G 1 p 101 will have varying degrees of success based on several factors most notably whether Country A has a data preservation law and whether the U S has sufficient law enforcement contacts in Country A to ensure prompt execution of the request The Council of Europe Cybercrime Convention completed in 2001 obligates all signatories to have the ability to affect cross border preservation requests and the availability of this critical form of assistance therefore is expected to increase greatly in the near future To secure preservation or in emergencies when immediate international assistance is required the international Network of 24 hour Points of Contact established by the High tech Crime Subgroup of the G8 countries can provide assistance This network created in 1997 is comprised of approximately twenty eight member countries and continues to grow every year N 5 5 Participating countries have a dedicated computer crime expert and a means to contact that office or person twenty four hours a day See generally Michael A Sussmann The Critical Challenges from International High Tech and Computer Related Crime at the Millennium 9 Duke J Comp Int l L 451 484 1999 CCIPS is the point of contact for the United States and can be contacted at 202 514 1026 during regular business hours or at other times through the Department of Justice Command Center at 202 514 5000 The Council of Europe s Cybercrime Convention obligates all signatory countries to have a 24 hour point of contact for cybercrime cases and international 24 hour response capabilities are therefore expected to continue to increase In addition CCIPS has high tech law enforcement contacts in many countries that are not a part of the G8 s network or the Council of Europe agents and prosecutors should call CCIPS for assistance In the event that United States law enforcement inadvertently accesses a computer located in another country CCIPS OIA or another appropriate authority should be consulted immediately as issues such as sovereignty and comity may be implicated Likewise if exigencies such as terrorist threats raise the possibility of direct access of a computer located abroad by United States law enforcement appropriate U S authorities should be consulted immediately Searching seizing or otherwise obtaining electronic evidence located outside of the United States can raise difficult questions of both law and policy For example the Fourth Amendment may apply under certain circumstances but not under others See generally United States v Verdugo Urquidez 494 U S 259 1990 considering the extent to which the Fourth Amendment applies to searches outside of the United States This manual does not attempt to provide detailed guidance on how to resolve difficult international issues that may arise in cases involving electronic evidence located beyond our borders Investigators and prosecutors should contact CCIPS or OIA for assistance in particular cases toc Table of Contents D Special Case Workplace Searches Warrantless workplace searches occur often in computer cases and raise unusually complicated legal issues The starting place for such analysis is the Supreme Court s complex decision in O Connor v Ortega 480 U S 709 1987 Under O Connor the legality of warrantless workplace searches depends on often subtle factual distinctions such as whether the workplace is public sector or private sector whether employment policies exist that authorize a search and whether the search is work related Every warrantless workplace search must be evaluated carefully on its facts In general however law enforcement officers can conduct a warrantless search of private i e non government workplaces only if the officers obtain the consent of either the employer or another employee with common authority over the area searched In public i e government workplaces officers cannot rely on an employer s consent but can conduct searches if written employment policies or office practices establish that the government employees targeted by the search cannot reasonably expect privacy in their workspace Further government employers and supervisors can conduct reasonable work related searches of employee workspaces without a warrant even if the searches violate employees reasonable expectation of privacy One cautionary note is in order here This discussion evaluates the legality of warrantless workplace searches of computers under the Fourth Amendment In many cases however workplace searches will implicate federal privacy statutes in addition to the Fourth Amendment For example efforts to obtain an employee s files and e mail from the employer s network server raise issues under the Electronic Communications Privacy Act 18 U S C 2701 2712 discussed in Chapter 3 and workplace monitoring of an employee s Internet use implicates Title III 18 U S C 2510 2522 discussed in Chapter 4 Before conducting a workplace search investigators must make sure that their search will not violate either the Fourth Amendment or relevant federal privacy statutes Investigators should contact CCIPS at 202 514 1026 or the CTC in their district see Introduction p ix for further assistance 1 Private Sector Workplace Searches The rules for conducting warrantless searches and seizures in private sector workplaces generally mirror the rules for conducting warrantless searches in homes and other personal residences Private company employees generally retain a reasonable expectation of privacy in their workplaces As a result searches by law enforcement of a private workplace will usually require a warrant unless the agents can obtain the consent of an employer or a co worker with common authority a Reasonable Expectation of Privacy in Private Sector Workplaces Private sector employees will usually retain a reasonable expectation of privacy in their office space In Mancusi v DeForte 392 U S 364 1968 police officers conducted a warrantless search of an office at a local union headquarters that defendant Frank DeForte shared with several other union officials In response to DeForte s claim that the search violated his Fourth Amendment rights the police officers argued that the joint use of the space by DeForte s co workers made his expectation of privacy unreasonable The Court disagreed stating that DeForte still could reasonably have expected that only his officemates and their personal or business guests would enter the office and that records would not be touched except with their permission or that of union higher ups Id at 369 Because only a specific group of people actually enjoyed joint access and use of DeForte s office the officers presence violated DeForte s reasonable expectation of privacy See id See also United States v Most 876 F 2d 191 198 D C Cir 1989 A n individual need not shut himself off from the world in order to retain his fourth amendment rights He may invite his friends into his home but exclude the police he may share his office with co workers without consenting to an official search United States v Lyons 706 F 2d 321 325 D C Cir 1983 One may freely admit guests of one s choosing or be legally obligated to admit specific persons without sacrificing one s right to expect that a space will remain secure against all others As a practical matter then private employees will generally retain an expectation of privacy in their work space unless that space is open to the world at large Id at 326 b Consent in Private Sector Workplaces Although most non government workplaces will support a reasonable expectation of privacy from a law enforcement search agents can defeat this expectation by obtaining the consent of a party who exercises common authority over the area searched See Matlock 415 U S at 171 In practice this means that agents can often overcome the warrant requirement by obtaining the consent of the target s employer or supervisor Depending on the facts a co worker s consent may suffice as well Private sector employers and supervisors generally enjoy a broad authority to consent to searches in the workplace For example in United States v Gargiso 456 F 2d 584 2d Cir 1972 a pre Matlock case agents conducting a criminal investigation of an employee of a private company sought access to a locked wired off area in the employer s basement The agents explained their needs to the company s vice president who took the agents to the basement and opened the basement with his key When the employee attempted to suppress the evidence that the agents discovered in the basement the court held that the vice president s consent was effective Because the vice president shared supervisory power over the basement with the employee the court reasoned he could consent to the agents search of that area See id at 586 87 See also United States v Bilanzich 771 F 2d 292 296 97 7th Cir 1985 holding that the owner of a hotel could consent to search of locked room used by hotel employee to store records even though owner did not carry a key because employee worked at owner s bidding J L Foti Constr Co v Donovan 786 F 2d 714 716 17 6th Cir 1986 per curiam holding that a general contractor s superintendent could consent to an inspection of an entire construction site including subcontractor s work area In a close case an employment policy or computer network banner that establishes the employer s right to consent to a workplace search can help establish the employer s common authority to consent under Matlock See s sappendix htm A Appendix A Agents should be careful about relying on a co worker s consent to conduct a workplace search While employers generally retain the right to access their employees work spaces co workers may or may not depending on the facts When co workers do exercise common authority over a workspace however investigators can rely on a co worker s consent to search that space For example in United States v Buettner Janusch 646 F 2d 759 2d Cir 1981 a professor and an undergraduate research assistant at New York University consented to a search of an NYU laboratory managed by a second professor suspected of using his laboratory to manufacture LSD and other drugs Although the search involved opening vials and several other closed containers the Second Circuit held that Matlock authorized the search because both consenting co workers had been authorized to make full use of the lab for their research See id at 765 66 See also United States v Jenkins 46 F 3d 447 455 58 5th Cir 1995 allowing an employee to consent to a search of the employer s property United States v Murphy 506 F 2d 529 530 9th Cir 1974 per curiam same United States v Longo 70 F Supp 2d 225 256 W D N Y 1999 allowing secretary to consent to search of employer s computer But see United States v Buitrago Pelaez 961 F Supp 64 67 68 S D N Y 1997 holding that a receptionist could consent to a general search of the office but not of a locked safe to which receptionist did not know the combination c Employer Searches in Private Sector Workplaces Warrantless workplace searches by private employers rarely violate the Fourth Amendment So long as the employer is not acting as an instrument or agent of the Government at the time of the search the search is a private search and the Fourth Amendment does not apply See Skinner v Railway Labor Executives Ass n 489 U S 602 614 1989 2 Public Sector Workplace Searches Although warrantless computer searches in private sector workplaces follow familiar Fourth Amendment rules the application of the Fourth Amendment to public sector workplace searches of computers presents a different matter In O Connor v Ortega 480 U S 709 1987 the Supreme Court introduced a distinct framework for evaluating warrantless searches in government workplaces a framework that applies to computer searches According to O Connor a government employee can enjoy a reasonable expectation of privacy in his workplace See id at 717 O Connor J plurality opinion id at 721 Scalia J concurring However an expectation of privacy becomes unreasonable if actual office practices and procedures or legitimate regulation permit the employee s supervisor co workers or the public to enter the employee s workspace Id at 717 O Connor J plurality opinion Further employers can conduct reasonable warrantless searches even if the searches violate an employee s reasonable expectation of privacy Such searches include work related noninvestigatory intrusions e g entering an employee s locked office to retrieve a file and reasonable investigations into work related misconduct See id at 725 26 O Connor J plurality opinion id at 732 Scalia J concurring a Reasonable Expectation of Privacy in Public Workplaces The reasonable expectation of privacy test formulated by the O Connor plurality asks whether a government employee s workspace is so open to fellow employees or to the public that no expectation of privacy is reasonable O Connor 480 U S at 718 plurality opinion This standard differs significantly from the standard analysis applied in private workplaces Whereas private sector employees enjoy a reasonable expectation of privacy in their workspace unless the space is open to the world at large Lyons 706 F 2d at 326 government employees retain a reasonable expectation of privacy in the workplace only if a case by case inquiry into actual office practices and procedures shows that it is reasonable for employees to expect that others will not enter their space See O Connor 480 U S at 717 plurality opinion Rossi v Town of Pelham 35 F Supp 2d 58 63 64 D N H 1997 See also O Connor 480 U S at 730 31 Scalia J concurring noting the difference between the expectation of privacy analysis offered by the O Connor plurality and that traditionally applied in private workplace searches From a practical standpoint then public employees are less likely to retain a reasonable expectation of privacy against government searches at work than are private employees Courts evaluating public employees reasonable expectation of privacy in the wake of O Connor have considered the following factors whether the work area in question is assigned solely to the employee whether others have access to the space whether the nature of the employment requires a close working relationship with others whether office regulations place employees on notice that certain areas are subject to search and whether the property searched is public or private See Vega Rodriguez v Puerto Rico Tel Co 110 F 3d 174 179 80 1st Cir 1997 summarizing cases United States v Mancini 8 F 3d 104 109 1st Cir 1993 In general the courts have rejected claims of an expectation of privacy in an office when the employee knew or should have known that others could access the employee s workspace See e g Sheppard v Beerman 18 F 3d 147 152 2d Cir 1994 holding that judge s search through his law clerk s desk and file cabinets did not violate the clerk s reasonable expectation of privacy because of the clerk s close working relationship with the judge Schowengerdt v United States 944 F 2d 483 488 9th Cir 1991 holding that civilian engineer employed by the Navy who worked with classified documents at an ordinance plant had no reasonable expectation of privacy in his office because investigators were known to search employees offices for evidence of misconduct on a regular basis But see United States v Taketa 923 F 2d 665 673 9th Cir 1991 concluding in dicta that public employee retained expectation of privacy in office shared with several co workers In contrast the courts have found that a search violates a public employee s reasonable expectation of privacy when the employee had no reason to expect that others would access the space searched See O Connor 480 U S at 718 19 plurality holding that physician at state hospital retained expectation of privacy in his desk and file cabinets where there was no evidence that other employees could enter his office and access its contents Rossi 35 F Supp 2d at 64 holding that town clerk enjoyed reasonable expectation of privacy in 8 x 8 office that the public could not access and other town employees did not enter While agents must evaluate whether a public employee retains a reasonable expectation of privacy in the workplace on a case by case basis official written employment policies can simplify the task dramatically See O Connor 480 U S at 717 plurality noting that legitimate regulation of the work place can reduce public employees Fourth Amendment protections Courts have uniformly deferred to public employers official policies that expressly authorize access to the employee s workspace and have relied on such policies when ruling that the employee cannot retain a reasonable expectation of privacy in the workplace See American Postal Workers Union Columbus Area Local AFL CIO v United States Postal Serv 871 F 2d 556 59 61 6th Cir 1989 holding that postal employees retained no reasonable expectation of privacy in contents of government lockers after signing waivers stating that lockers were subject to inspection at any time even though lockers contained personal items United States v Bunkers 521 F 2d 1217 1219 1221 9th Cir 1975 same noting language in postal manual stating that locker is subject to search by supervisors and postal inspectors Of course whether a specific policy eliminates a reasonable expectation of privacy is a factual question Employment policies that do not explicitly address employee privacy may prove insufficient to eliminate Fourth Amendment protection See e g Taketa 923 F 2d at 672 73 concluding that regulation requiring DEA employees to maintain clean desks did not defeat workplace expectation of privacy of non DEA employee assigned to DEA office When planning to search a government computer in a government workplace agents should look for official employment policies or banners that can eliminate a reasonable expectation of privacy in the computer Written employment policies and banners are particularly important in cases that consider whether government employees enjoy a reasonable expectation of privacy in government computers Banners are written notices that greet users before they log on to a computer or computer network and can inform users of the privacy rights that they do or do not retain in their use of the computer or network See generally s smanual htm A Appendix A In general government employees who are notified that their employer has retained rights to access or inspect information stored on the employer s computers can have no reasonable expectation of privacy in the information stored there For example in United States v Simons 206 F 3d 392 4th Cir 2000 computer specialists at a division of the Central Intelligence Agency learned that an employee named Mark Simons had been using his desktop computer at work to obtain pornography available on the Internet in violation of CIA policy The computer specialists accessed Simons computer remotely without a warrant and obtained copies of over a thousands picture files that Simons had stored on his hard drive Many of these picture files contained child pornography which were turned over to law enforcement When Simons filed a motion to suppress the fruits of the remote search of his hard drive the Fourth Circuit held that the CIA division s official Internet usage policy eliminated any reasonable expectation of privacy that Simons might otherwise have in the copied files See id at 398 The policy stated that the CIA division would periodically audit inspect and or monitor each user s Internet access as deemed appropriate and that such auditing would be implemented to support identification termination and prosecution of unauthorized activity Id at 395 96 Simons did not deny that he was aware of the policy See id at 398 n 8 In light of the policy the Fourth Circuit held Simons did not retain a reasonable expectation of privacy with regard to the record or fruits of his Internet use including the files he had downloaded Id at 398 Other courts have agreed with the approach articulated in Simons and have held that banners and policies generally eliminate a reasonable expectation of privacy in contents stored in a government employee s network account See United States v Angevine 281 F 3d 1130 1134 35 10th Cir 2002 holding that banner and computer policy eliminated a public employee s reasonable expectation of privacy in data downloaded from Internet Wasson v Sonoma County Junior College 4 F Supp 2d 893 905 06 N D Cal 1997 holding that public employer s computer policy giving the employer the right to access all information stored on the employer s computers defeats an employee s reasonable expectation of privacy in files stored on employer s computers Bohach v City of Reno 932 F Supp 1232 1235 D Nev 1996 holding that police officers did not retain a reasonable expectation of privacy in their use of a pager system in part because the Chief of Police had issued an order announcing that all messages would be logged United States v Monroe 52 M J 326 330 C A A F 2000 holding that Air Force sergeant did not have a reasonable expectation of privacy in his government e mail account because e mail use was reserved for official business and network banner informed each user upon logging on to the network that use was subject to monitoring But see DeMaine v Samuels 2000 WL 1658586 at 7 D Conn Sept 25 2000 suggesting that the existence of an employment manual explicitly authorizing searches weighs heavily in the determination of whether a government employee retained a reasonable expectation of privacy at work but does not on its own dispose of the question Conversely a court may note the absence of a banner or computer policy in finding that an employee has a reasonable expectation of privacy in the use of his computer See United States v Slanina 283 F 3d 670 676 77 5th Cir 2002 Of course whether a specific policy eliminates a reasonable expectation of privacy is a factual question Agents and prosecutors must consider whether a given policy is broad enough to reasonably contemplate the search to be conducted If the policy is narrow it may not waive the government employee s reasonable expectation of privacy against the search that the government plans to execute For example in Simons the Fourth Circuit concluded that although the CIA division s Internet usage policy eliminated Simons reasonable expectation of privacy in the fruits of his Internet use it did not eliminate his reasonable expectation of privacy in the physical confines of his office See Simons 206 F 3d at 399 n 10 Accordingly the policy by itself was insufficient to justify a physical entry into Simons office See id at 399 See also Taketa 923 F 2d at 672 73 concluding that regulation requiring DEA employees to maintain clean desks did not defeat workplace expectation of privacy of non DEA employee assigned to DEA office Sample banners appear in Appendix A b Reasonable Workplace Searches Under O Connor v Ortega Government employers and their agents can conduct reasonable work related searches even if those searches violate an employee s reasonable expectation of privacy In most circumstances a warrant must be obtained before a government actor can conduct a search that violates an individual s reasonable expectation of privacy In the context of government employment however the government s role as an employer as opposed to its role as a law enforcer presents a special case In O Connor the Supreme Court held that a public employer or the employer s agent can conduct a workplace search that violates a public employee s reasonable expectation of privacy so long as the search is reasonable See O Connor 480 U S at 722 23 plurality Id at 732 Scalia J concurring The Court s decision adds public workplace searches by employers to the list of special needs exceptions to the warrant requirement The special needs exceptions permit the government to dispense with the usual warrant requirement when its officials infringe upon protected privacy rights in the course of acting in a non law enforcement capacity See e g New Jersey v T L O 469 U S 325 351 1985 Blackmun J concurring applying the special needs exception to permit public school officials to search student property without a warrant in an effort to maintain discipline and order in public schools National Treasury Employees Union v Von Raab 489 U S 656 677 1989 applying the special needs exception to permit warrantless drug testing of Customs employees who seek promotions to positions where they would handle sensitive information In these cases the Court has held that the need for government officials to pursue legitimate non law enforcement aims justifies a relaxing of the warrant requirement because the burden of obtaining a warrant is likely to frustrate the non law enforcement governmental purpose behind the search O Connor 480 U S at 720 quoting Camara v Municipal Court 387 U S 523 533 1967 According to O Connor a warrantless search must satisfy two requirements to qualify as reasonable First the employer or his agents must participate in the search for a work related reason rather than merely to obtain evidence for use in criminal proceedings Second the search must be justified at its inception and permissible in its scope i The Search Must Be Work Related The first element of O Connor s reasonableness test requires that the employer or his agents must participate in the search for a work related reason rather than merely to obtain evidence for use in criminal proceedings See O Connor 480 U S at 721 This element limits the O Connor exception to circumstances in which the government actors who conduct the search act in their capacity as employers rather than law enforcers The O Connor Court specified two such circumstances First the Court concluded that public employers can conduct reasonable work related noninvestigatory intrusions such as entering an employee s office to retrieve a file or report while the employee is out See id at 721 22 plurality Id at 732 Scalia J concurring Second the Court concluded that employers can conduct reasonable investigations into an employee s work related misconduct such as entering an employee s office to investigate employee misfeasance that threatens the efficient and proper operation of the office See id at 724 plurality Id at 732 Scalia J concurring The line between a legitimate work related search and an illegitimate search for criminal evidence is clear in theory but often blurry in fact Public employers who learn of misconduct at work may investigate it with dual motives they may seek evidence both to root out inefficiency incompetence mismanagement or other work related misfeasance id at 724 and also to collect evidence for a criminal prosecution Indeed the two categories may merge altogether For example government officials who have criminal investigators under their command may respond to allegations of work related misconduct by directing the investigators to search employee offices for evidence of a crime The courts have adopted fairly generous interpretations of O Connor when confronted with mixed motive searches In general the presence and involvement of law enforcement officers will not invalidate the search so long as the employer or his agent participates in the search for legitimate work related reasons See e g United States v Slanina 283 F 3d 670 678 5th Cir 2002 approving search by official in charge of fire and police departments and stating that O Connor s goal of ensuring an efficient workplace should not be frustrated simply because the same misconduct that violates a government employer s policy also happens to be illegal Gossmeyer v McDonald 128 F 3d 481 492 7th Cir 1997 concluding that presence of law enforcement officers in a search team looking for evidence of work related misconduct does not transform search into an illegitimate law enforcement search Taketa 923 F 2d at 674 concluding that search of DEA office space by DEA agents investigating allegations of illegal wiretapping was an internal investigation directed at uncovering work related employee misconduct Shields v Burge 874 F 2d 1201 1202 05 7th Cir 1989 applying the O Connor exception to an internal affairs investigation of a police sergeant that paralleled a criminal investigation Ross v Hinton 740 F Supp 451 458 S D Ohio 1990 concluding that a public employer s discussions with law enforcement officer concerning employee s alleged criminal misconduct culminating in officer s advice to secure the employee s files did not transform employer s subsequent search of employee s office into a law enforcement search Although the presence of law enforcement officers ordinarily will not invalidate a work related search a few courts have indicated that whether O Connor applies depends as much on the identity of the personnel who conduct the search as whether the purpose of the search is work related For example in United States v Simons 206 F 3d 392 400 4th Cir 2000 the Fourth Circuit concluded that O Connor authorized the search of a government employee s office by his supervisor even though the dominant purpose of the search was to uncover evidence of a crime Because the search was conducted by the employee s supervisor the Court indicated it fell within the scope of O Connor See id The employer did not lose its special need for the efficient and proper operation of the workplace merely because the evidence obtained was evidence of a crime internal quotations and citations omitted Conversely one district court has held that the O Connor exception did not apply when a government employer sent a uniformed police officer to an employee s office even though the purpose of the police officer s presence was entirely work related See Rossi v Town of Pelham 35 F Supp 2d 58 65 66 D N H 1997 civil action pursuant to 42 U S C 1983 concluding that O Connor exception did not apply when town officials sent a single police officer to town clerk s office to ensure that clerk did not remove public records from her office before a scheduled audit could occur the resulting search was a police intrusion rather than an employer intrusion Of course courts will invalidate warrantless workplace searches when the facts establish that law enforcement provided the true impetus for the search and the search violated an employee s reasonable expectation of privacy See United States v Hagarty 388 F 2d 713 717 7th Cir 1968 holding that surveillance installed by criminal investigators violated the Fourth Amendment where purpose of surveillance was to detect criminal activity rather than to supervise and investigate a government employee United States v Kahan 350 F Supp 784 791 S D N Y 1972 invalidating warrantless search of INS employee s wastebasket by INS criminal investigator who searched the employee s wastebasket for evidence of a crime every day after work with the employer s consent rev d in part on other grounds 479 F 2d 290 2d Cir 1973 rev d with directions to reinstate the district court judgment 415 U S 239 1974 ii The Search Must Be Justified At Its Inception And Permissible In Its Scope To be reasonable under the Fourth Amendment a work related employer search of the type endorsed in O Connor must also be both justified at its inception and permissible in its scope O Connor 480 U S at 726 plurality A search will be justified at its inception when there are reasonable grounds for suspecting that the search will turn up evidence that the employee is guilty of work related misconduct or that the search is necessary for a noninvestigatory work related purpose Id See e g Simons 206 F 3d at 401 holding that entrance into employee s office to seize his computer was justified at its inception because employer knew that employee had used the computer to download child pornography Gossmeyer 128 F 3d at 491 holding that co worker s specific allegations of serious misconduct made Sheriff s search of Child Protective Investigator s locked desk and file cabinets justified at its inception Taketa 923 F 2d at 674 concluding that report of misconduct justified initial search of employee s office Shields 874 F 2d at 1204 suggesting in dicta that search of police officer s desk for narcotics pursuant to internal affairs investigation might be reasonable following an anonymous tip DeMaine v Samuels 2000 WL 1658586 at 10 D Conn Sept 25 2000 holding that search of police officer s day planner was justified by information from two reliable sources that the officer kept detailed attendance notes relevant to overtime investigation involving other officers Williams v Philadelphia Housing Auth 826 F Supp 952 954 E D Pa 1993 concluding that employee s search for a computer disk in employee s office was justified at its inception because employer needed contents of disk for official purposes Compare Ortega v O Connor 146 F 3d 1149 1162 9th Cir 1998 concluding that vague uncorroborated and stale complaints of misconduct do not justify a decision to search an employee s office A search will be permissible in its scope when the measures adopted are reasonably related to the objectives of the search and are not excessively intrusive in light of the nature of the misconduct O Connor 480 U S at 726 plurality internal quotations omitted This standard requires employers and their agents to tailor work related searches to the alleged misfeasance See e g Leventhal v Knapek 266 F 3d 64 75 77 2d Cir 2001 holding that search for the presence of non agency approved software on employee s computer was not excessively intrusive because officials searched only file names at first and then searched only suspicious directories on subsequent visits Simons 206 F 3d at 401 holding that search for child pornography believed to be stored in employee s computer was permissible in scope because individual who conducted the search simply crossed the floor of the defendant s office switched hard drives and exited Gossmeyer 128 F 3d at 491 concluding that workplace search for images of child pornography was permissible in scope because it was limited to places where such images would likely be stored Samuels 2000 WL 1658586 at 10 holding that search through police officer s day planner was reasonable because Internal Affairs investigators had reason to believe day planner contained information relevant to investigation of overtime abuse If employers conduct a search that unreasonably exceeds the scope necessary to pursue the employer s legitimate work related objectives the search will be unreasonable and will violate the Fourth Amendment See O Connor 146 F 3d at 1163 concluding that a general and unbounded search of an employee s desk cabinets and personal papers was impermissible in scope where the search team did not attempt to limit their investigation to evidence of alleged misconduct c Consent in Public Sector Workplaces Although public employers may search employees workplaces without a warrant for work related reasons public workplaces offer a more restrictive milieu in one respect In government workplaces employers acting in their official capacity generally cannot consent to a law enforcement search of their employees offices See United States v Blok 188 F 2d 1019 1021 D C Cir 1951 concluding that a government supervisor cannot consent to a law enforcement search of a government employee s desk Taketa 923 F 2d at 673 Kahan 350 F Supp at 791 The rationale for this result is that the Fourth Amendment cannot permit one government official to consent to a search by another See Blok 188 F 2d at 1021 Operation of a government agency and enforcement of criminal law do not amalgamate to give a right of search beyond the scope of either Accordingly law enforcement searches conducted pursuant to a public employer s consent must be evaluated under O Connor rather than the third party consent rules of Matlock The question in such cases is not whether the public employer had common authority to consent to the search but rather whether the combined law enforcement and employer search satisfied the Fourth Amendment standards of O Connor v Ortega SPAN toc Table of Contents II SEARCHING AND SEIZING COMPUTERS WITH A WARRANT A Introduction The legal framework for searching and seizing computers with a warrant largely mirrors the legal framework for other searches and seizures As with any kind of search pursuant to a warrant law enforcement must establish probable cause supported by Oath or affirmation and must particularly describ e the place to be searched and the persons or things to be seized U S Const Amend 4 Despite the common legal framework computer searches differ from other searches because computer technologies frequently force agents to execute computer searches in nontraditional ways Consider the traditional case of a warrant to seize a stolen car from a private parking lot Agents generally can assume that the lot will still exist in its prior location when the agents execute the search and can assume they will be able to identify the stolen car quickly based on the car s model make license plate or Vehicle Identification Number As a result the process of drafting the warrant and executing the search is relatively simple After the agents establish probable cause and describe the car and lot to the magistrate judge the magistrate judge can issue the warrant authorizing the agents to go to the lot and retrieve the car Searches for computer files tend to be more complicated Because computer files consist of electrical impulses that can be stored on the head of a pin and moved around the world in an instant agents may not know where computer files are stored or in what form Files may be stored on a floppy diskette on a hidden directory in a suspect s laptop or on a remote server located thousands of miles away The files may be encrypted misleadingly titled stored in unusual file formats or commingled with millions of unrelated innocuous and even statutorily protected files As a result of these uncertainties agents cannot simply establish probable cause describe the files they need and then go and retrieve the data Instead they must understand the technical limits of different search techniques plan the search carefully and then draft the warrant in a manner that authorizes the agents to take necessary steps to obtain the evidence they need Searching and seizing computers with a warrant is as much an art as a science In general however agents and prosecutors have found that they can maximize the likelihood of a successful search and seizure by following these four steps 1 Assemble a team consisting of the case agent the prosecutor and a technical expert as far in advance of the search as possible Although the lead investigating agent is the central figure in most searches computer searches generally require a team with three important players the agent the prosecutor and a technical specialist with expertise in computers and computer forensics In most computer searches the case agent organizes and directs the search learns as much as possible about the computers to be searched and writes the affidavit establishing probable cause The technical specialist explains the technical limitations that govern the search to the case agent and prosecutor creates the plan for executing the search and in many cases takes the lead role in executing the search itself Finally the prosecutor reviews the affidavit and warrant and makes sure that the entire process complies with the Fourth Amendment and Rule 41 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure Of course each member of the team should collaborate with the others to help ensure an effective search There are many sources of technical expertise in the federal government Most agencies that have law enforcement investigators also have technical specialists trained in computer forensics For example the FBI has Computer Analysis Response Team CART examiners the Internal Revenue Service has Seized Computer Evidence Recovery SCER specialists and the Secret Service has the Electronic Crime Special Agent Program ECSAP Investigating agents should contact the technical experts within their own agency Further some agencies offer case agents sufficient technical training that they may also be able to act as technical specialists In such cases the case agents normally do not need to consult with technical experts and can serve as technical specialists and case agents simultaneously 2 Learn as much as possible about the computer system that will be searched before devising a search strategy or drafting the warrant After assembling the team the case agent should begin acquiring as much information as possible about the computer system targeted by the search It is difficult to overstate the importance of this step For the most part the need for detailed and accurate information about the targeted computer results from practical considerations Until the agent has learned what kinds of computers and operating systems the target uses it is impossible to know how the information the system contains can be retrieved or even where the information may be located Every computer and computer network is different and subtle differences in hardware software operating systems and system configuration can alter the search plan dramatically For example a particular search strategy may work well if a targeted network runs the Linux operating system but might not work if the network runs Windows NT instead These concerns are particularly important when searches involve complicated computer networks as opposed to stand alone PCs For example the mere fact that a business uses computers in its offices does not mean that the devices found there actually contain any useful information Businesses may contract with network service providers that store the business s information on remote network servers located miles possibly thousands of miles away As a result of these considerations a technical specialist cannot advise the case agent on the practical aspects of different search strategies without knowing the nature of the computer system to be searched Agents need to learn as much as possible about the targeted computer before drafting the warrant including if possible the hardware the software the operating system and the configuration of the network Obtaining detailed and accurate information about the targeted computer also has important legal implications For example the incidental seizure of First Amendment materials such as drafts of newsletters or web pages may implicate the Privacy Protection Act PPA 42 U S C 2000aa and the incidental seizure and subsequent search through network accounts may raise issues under the Electronic Communications Privacy Act ECPA 18 U S C 2701 2712 see generally Parts B 2 and B 3 infra To minimize liability under these statutes agents should conduct a careful investigation into whether and where First Amendment materials and network accounts may be stored on the computer system targeted by the search At least one court has suggested that a failure to conduct such an investigation can deprive the government of a good faith defense against liability under these statutes See Steve Jackson Games Inc v United States Secret Service 816 F Supp 432 W D Tex 1993 aff d 36 F 3d 457 5th Cir 1994 On a practical level agents may take various approaches to learning about a targeted computer network In some cases agents can interview the system administrator of the targeted network sometimes in an undercover capacity and obtain all or most of the information the technical specialist needs to plan and execute the search When this is impossible or dangerous more piecemeal strategies may prove effective For example agents sometimes conduct on site visits often undercover that at least reveal some elements of the hardware involved A useful source of information for networks connected to the Internet is the Internet itself It is often possible for members of the public to use network queries to determine the operating system machines and general layout of a targeted network connected to the Internet although it may set off alarms at the target network 3 Formulate a strategy for conducting the search including a backup plan based on the known information about the targeted computer system With a team in place and the targeted system researched the next step is to formulate a strategy for conducting the search For example will the agents search through the targeted computer s on the premises or will they simply enter the premises and remove all of the hardware Will the agents make copies of individual files or will they make exact copies of entire hard drives What will the agents do if their original plan fails or if the computer hardware or software turns out to be significantly different from what they expected These decisions hinge on a series of practical and legal considerations In most cases the search team should decide on a preferred search strategy and then plan a series of backup strategies if the preferred strategy proves impractical In many cases agents will be unable to learn enough about the computer system to be searched to devise a single or comprehensive search strategy As a result agents should recognize how the aspects of the system that they do not know about can affect the search strategy Even where a considerable amount is known about a system the agents and technicians conducting a review of the data often have to use a number of different techniques in order to thoroughly search a computer and its storage media Sometimes seemingly commonplace data or configurations cannot be copied reviewed or analyzed by one search program or protocol so another or several different ones must be tried Keyword searches may not be possible until a careful review of a portion of the files is conducted moreover a careful data search may reveal other otherwise unapparent aspects of how the system was used and data generated accessed transmitted and stored It is important for agents to keep such possibilities in mind and to consider and address them as they formulate their strategy The issues that must be considered when formulating a strategy to search and seize a computer are discussed in greater depth in section B of this chapter In general however the issues group into four questions First what is the most effective search strategy that will comply with Rule 41 and the Fourth Amendment Second does the search strategy need to be modified to minimize the possibility of violating either the PPA or ECPA Third will the search require multiple warrants And fourth should agents ask for special permission to conduct a no knock or sneak and peek search 4 Draft the warrant taking special care to describe the object of the search and the property to be seized accurately and particularly and explain the possible search strategies as well as the practical and legal issues that helped shape it in the supporting affidavit The essential ingredients for drafting a successful search warrant are covered in Section C and a practical guide to drafting warrants and affidavits appears in Appendix F In general however the keys to drafting successful computer search warrants are first to describe carefully and particularly the object of the warrant that investigators have probable cause to seize and second to explain adequately the search strategy in the supporting affidavit On a practical level these steps help focus and guide the investigators as they execute the search As a legal matter the first step helps to overcome particularity challenges and the latter helps to thwart claims that the agents executed the search in flagrant disregard of the warrant toc Table of Contents B Planning the Search 1 Basic Strategies for Executing Computer Searches Computer searches may be executed in a variety of ways For the most part there are four possibilities Search the computer and print out a hard copy of particular files at that time Search the computer and make an electronic copy of particular files at that time Create a duplicate electronic copy of the entire storage device on site and then later recreate a working copy of the storage device off site for review N 6 6 and Seize the equipment remove it from the premises and review its contents off site Which option is best for any particular search depends on many factors The single most important consideration is the role of the computer hardware in the offense It should be noted that the first option printing out hard copies of particular files is rarely a good choice That option may lead to substantial loss of information including file date and time stamps file path name undo history comment fields and more Although every computer search is unique search strategies often depend on the role of the hardware in the offense If the hardware is itself evidence an instrumentality contraband or a fruit of crime agents will usually plan to seize the hardware and search its contents off site If the hardware is merely a storage device for evidence agents generally will only seize the hardware if less disruptive alternatives are not feasible In general computer hardware can serve one of two roles in a criminal case First the computer hardware can be a storage device for evidence of crime For example if a suspect keeps evidence of his fraud schemes stored in his personal computer the hardware itself is merely a container for evidence The purpose of searching the suspect s computer will be to recover the evidence the computer hardware happens to contain In other cases however computer hardware can itself be contraband evidence an instrumentality or a fruit of crime For example a computer used to transmit child pornography is an instrumentality of crime and stolen computers are fruits of crime In such cases Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 41 grants agents the right to seize the computer itself independently from the materials that the hardware happens to contain See generally Appendix F explaining the scope of materials that may be seized according to Rule 41 Because Rule 41 authorizes agents to seize hardware in the latter case but not the former the search strategy for a particular computer search hinges first on the role of the hardware in the offense N 7 7 a When Hardware Is Itself Contraband Evidence or an Instrumentality or Fruit of Crime Under Fed R Crim P 41 b agents may obtain search warrants to seize computer hardware if the hardware is contraband evidence or an instrumentality or fruit of crime See Rule 41 b Appendix F When the hardware itself may be seized according to Rule 41 agents will usually conduct the search by seizing the computer and searching it off site For example a home personal computer used to store and transmit contraband images is itself an instrumentality of the crime See Davis v Gracey 111 F 3d 1472 1480 10th Cir 1997 computer used to store obscene images United States v Lamb 945 F Supp 441 462 N D N Y 1996 computer used to store child pornography Accordingly Rule 41 permits agents to obtain a warrant authorizing the seizure of the computer hardware In most cases investigators will simply obtain a warrant to seize the computer seize the hardware during the search and then search through the defendant s computer for the contraband files back at the police station or computer forensics laboratory In such cases the agents should explain clearly in the supporting affidavit that they plan to search the computer for evidence and or contraband after the computer has been seized and removed from the site of the search Notably exceptions exist when agents will not want to seize computer hardware even when the hardware is used as an instrumentality evidence contraband or a fruit of crime When the computer involved is not a stand alone PC but rather part of a complicated network the collateral damage and practical headaches that can arise from seizing the entire network often counsel against a wholesale seizure For example if a system administrator of a computer network stores stolen proprietary information somewhere in the network the network becomes an instrumentality of the system administrator s crime Technically agents could perhaps obtain a warrant to seize the entire network However carting off the entire network might cripple a legitimate functioning business and disrupt the lives of hundreds of people as well as subject the government to civil suits under the Privacy Protection Act 42 U S C 2000aa and the Electronic Communications Privacy Act 18 U S C 2701 2712 See generally Steve Jackson Games Inc v Secret Service 816 F Supp 432 440 443 W D Tex 1993 discussed infra In such circumstances agents will want to take a more nuanced approach to obtain the evidence they need On the other hand where a network is owned and operated by a criminal enterprise it may be appropriate to seize the network to stop ongoing criminal activity and prevent further substantial loss to victims Such a seizure may require a significant commitment of resources and advanced planning Agents faced with such a situation can call the Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section at 202 514 1026 or the Assistant U S Attorney designated as a Computer and Telecommunications Coordinator CTC in their district see Introduction p ix for more specific guidance b When Hardware is Merely a Storage Device for Evidence of Crime The strategy for conducting a computer search is significantly different if the computer hardware is merely a storage device for evidence of a crime In such cases Rule 41 b authorizes agents to obtain a warrant to seize the electronic evidence but arguably does not directly authorize the agents to seize the hardware that happens to contain that evidence Cf United States v Tamura 694 F 2d 591 595 9th Cir 1982 noting that probable cause to seize specific paper files enumerated in warrant technically does permit the seizure of commingled innocent files The hardware is merely a storage container for evidence not evidence itself This does not mean that the government cannot seize the equipment rather it means that the government generally should only seize the equipment if a less intrusive alternative that permits the effective recovery of the evidence is infeasible in the particular circumstances of the case Cf id at 596 As a practical matter circumstances will often require investigators to seize equipment and search its contents off site First it may take days or weeks to find the specific information described in the warrant because computer storage devices can contain extraordinary amounts of information Agents cannot reasonably be expected to spend more than a few hours searching for materials on site and in some circumstances such as executing a search at a suspect s home even a few hours may be unreasonable See United States v Santarelli 778 F 2d 609 615 16 11th Cir 1985 Given that personal computers sold in the year 2002 usually can store the equivalent of thirty million pages of information and networks can store hundreds of times that and these capacities double nearly every year it may be practically impossible for agents to search quickly through a computer for specific data a particular file or a broad set of files while on site Even if the agents know specific information about the files they seek the data may be mislabeled encrypted stored in hidden directories or embedded in slack space that a simple file listing will ignore Recovering the evidence may require painstaking analysis by an expert in the controlled environment of a forensics laboratory Attempting to search files on site may even risk damaging the evidence itself in some cases Agents executing a search may learn on site that the computer employs an uncommon operating system that the on site technical specialist does not fully understand Because an inartful attempt to conduct a search may destroy evidence the best strategy may be to remove the hardware so that a government expert in that particular operating system can examine the computer later Off site searches also may be necessary if agents have reason to believe that the computer has been booby trapped by a savvy criminal Technically adept users may know how to trip wire their computers with self destruct programs that could erase vital evidence if the system were examined by anyone other than an expert For example a criminal could write a very short program that would cause the computer to demand a password periodically and if the correct password is not entered within ten seconds would trigger the automatic destruction of the computer s files In these cases it is best to seize the equipment and permit an off site expert to disarm the program before any search occurs In light of these uncertainties agents often plan to try to search on site with the understanding that they will seize the equipment if circumstances discovered on site make an on site search infeasible Once on site to execute the search the agents will assess the hardware software and resources available to determine whether an on site search is possible In many cases the search strategy will depend on the sensitivity of the environment in which the search occurs For example agents seeking to obtain information stored on the computer network of a functioning business will in most circumstances want to make every effort to obtain the information without seizing the business s computers if possible In such situations a tiered search strategy designed to use the least intrusive approach that will recover the information is generally appropriate Such approaches are discussed in Appendix F Whatever search strategy is chosen it should be explained fully in the affidavit supporting the warrant application Sometimes conducting a search on site will be possible A friendly employee or system administrator may agree to pinpoint a file or record or may have a recent backup permitting the agents to obtain a hard copy of the files they seek while on site See e g United States v Longo 70 F Supp 2d 225 W D N Y 1999 upholding pinpoint search aided by suspect s secretary for two particular computer files Alternatively agents may be able to locate the targeted set of files and make electronic copies or may be able to mirror a segment of the storage drive based on knowledge that the information exists within that segment of the drive Of course such strategies will frequently prove insufficient Relatively few cases call for a limited set of known files searches for evidence of a particular crime are usually more open ended If the agents cannot learn where the information is stored or cannot create a working mirror image for technical reasons they may have no choice but to seize the computer and remove it Because personal computers are easily moved and can be searched effectively off site using special forensics tools agents are particularly likely to seize personal computers absent unusual circumstances The general strategy is to pursue the quickest least intrusive and most direct search strategy that is consistent with securing the evidence described in the warrant This strategy will permit agents to search on site in some cases and will permit them to seize the computers for off site review in others Flexibility is the key 2 The Privacy Protection Act When agents have reason to believe that a search may result in a seizure of materials relating to First Amendment activities such as publishing or posting materials on the World Wide Web they must consider the effect of the Privacy Protection Act PPA 42 U S C 2000aa Every federal computer search that implicates the PPA must be approved by the Justice Department coordinated through CCIPS at 202 514 1026 Under the Privacy Protection Act PPA 42 U S C 2000aa law enforcement must take special steps when planning a search that agents have reason to believe may result in the seizure of certain First Amendment materials Federal law enforcement searches that implicate the PPA must be pre approved by a Deputy Assistant Attorney General of the Criminal Division The Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section serves as the contact point for all such searches involving computers and should be contacted directly at 202 514 1026 a A Brief History of the Privacy Protection Act Before the Supreme Court decided Warden v Hayden 387 U S 294 309 1967 law enforcement officers could not obtain search warrants to search for and seize mere evidence of crime Warrants were permitted only to seize contraband instrumentalities or fruits of crime See Boyd v United States 116 U S 616 1886 In Hayden the Court reversed course and held that the Fourth Amendment permitted the government to obtain search warrants to seize mere evidence This ruling set the stage for a collision between law enforcement and the press Because journalists and reporters often collect evidence of criminal activity in the course of developing news stories they frequently possess mere evidence of crime that may prove useful to law enforcement investigations By freeing the Fourth Amendment from Boyd s restrictive regime Hayden created the possibility that law enforcement could use search warrants to target the press for evidence of crime it had collected in the course of investigating and reporting news stories It did not take long for such a search to occur On April 12 1971 the District Attorney s Office in Santa Clara County California obtained a search warrant to search the offices of The Stanford Daily a Stanford University student newspaper The DA s office was investigating a violent clash between the police and demonstrators that had occurred at the Stanford University Hospital three days earlier The Stanford Daily had covered the incident and published a special edition featuring photographs of the clash Believing that the newspaper probably had more photographs of the clash that could help the police identify the demonstrators the police obtained a warrant and sent four police officers to search the newspaper s office for further evidence that could assist the investigation The officers found nothing A month later however the Stanford Daily and its editors brought a civil suit against the police claiming that the search had violated their First and Fourth Amendment rights The case ultimately reached the Supreme Court and in Zurcher v Stanford Daily 436 U S 547 1978 the Court rejected the newspaper s claims Although the Court noted that the Fourth Amendment does not prevent or advise against legislative or executive efforts to establish nonconstitutional protections for searches of the press it held that neither the Fourth nor First Amendment prohibited such searches Id at 567 Congress passed the PPA in 1980 in response to Stanford Daily According to the Senate Report the PPA protected the press and certain other persons not suspected of committing a crime with protections not provided currently by the Fourth Amendment S Rep No 96 874 at 4 1980 reprinted in 1980 U S C C A N 3950 The statute was intended to grant publishers certain statutory rights to discourage law enforcement officers from targeting publishers simply because they often gathered mere evidence of crime As the legislative history indicates the purpose of this statute is to limit searches for materials held by persons involved in First Amendment activities who are themselves not suspected of participation in the criminal activity for which the materials are sought and not to limit the ability of law enforcement officers to search for and seize materials held by those suspected of committing the crime under investigation Id at 11 b The Terms of the Privacy Protection Act Subject to certain exceptions the PPA makes it unlawful for a government officer to search for or seize materials when a the materials are work product materials prepared produced authored or created in anticipation of communicating such materials to the public 42 U S C 2000aa 7 b 1 b the materials include mental impressions conclusions or theories of its creator 42 U S C 2000aa 7 b 3 and c the materials are possessed for the purpose of communicating the material to the public by a person reasonably believed to have a purpose to disseminate to the public some form of public communication 42 U S C 2000aa 7 b 3 2000aa a or a the materials are documentary materials that contain information 42 U S C 2000aa 7 a and b the materials are possessed by a person in connection with a purpose to disseminate to the public some form of public communication 42 U S C 2000aa b 2000aa 7 a Although the language of the PPA is broad the statute contains several exceptions Searches will not violate the PPA when 1 the only materials searched for or seized are contraband instrumentalities or fruits of crime see 42 U S C 2000aa 7 a b 2 there is reason to believe that the immediate seizure of such materials is necessary to prevent death or serious bodily injury see 42 U S C 2000aa a 2 2000aa b 2 3 there is probable cause to believe that the person possessing such materials has committed or is committing the criminal offense to which the materials relate an exception which is itself subject to several exceptions see 42 U S C 2000aa a 1 2000aa b 1 and 4 in a search for or seizure of documentary materials as defined by 2000aa 7 a a subpoena has proven inadequate or there is reason to believe that a subpoena would not result in the production of the materials see 42 U S C 2000aa b 3 4 Violations of the PPA do not result in suppression of the evidence see 42 U S C 2000aa 6 d but can result in civil damages against the sovereign whose officers or employees execute the search See 2000aa 6 a e Davis v Gracey 111 F 3d 1472 1482 10th Cir 1997 dismissing PPA suit against municipal officers in their personal capacities because such suits must be filed only against the government entity unless the government entity has not waived sovereign immunity If State officers or employees violate the PPA and the state does not waive its sovereign immunity and is thus immune from suit see Barnes v State of Missouri 960 F 2d 63 65 8th Cir 1992 individual State officers or employees may be held liable for acts within the scope or under the color of their employment subject to a reasonable good faith defense See 2000aa 6 a 2 b c Application of the PPA to Computer Searches and Seizures PPA issues frequently arise in computer cases for two reasons that Congress could not have foreseen in 1980 First the use of personal computers for publishing and the World Wide Web has dramatically expanded the scope of who is involved in First Amendment activities Today anyone with a computer and access to the Internet may be a publisher who possesses PPA protected materials on his or her computer The second reason that PPA issues arise frequently in computer cases is that the language of the statute does not explicitly rule out liability following incidental seizures of PPA protected materials and such seizures may result when agents search for and seize computer stored contraband or evidence of crime that is commingled with PPA protected materials For example investigations into illegal businesses that publish images of child pornography over the Internet have revealed that such businesses frequently support other publishing materials such as drafts of adult pornography that may be PPA protected Seizing the computer for the contraband necessarily results in the seizure of the PPA protected materials because the contraband is commingled with PPA protected materials on the business s computers If the PPA were interpreted to forbid such seizures the statute would not merely deter law enforcement from targeting innocent publishers for their evidence but also would bar the search and seizure of a criminal suspect s computer if the computer included PPA protected materials even incidentally The legislative history and text of the PPA indicate that Congress probably intended the PPA to apply only when law enforcement intentionally targeted First Amendment material that related to a crime as in Stanford Daily For example the so called suspect exception eliminates PPA liability when there is probable cause to believe that the person possessing such materials has committed or is committing the criminal offense to which the materials relate 42 U S C 2000aa a 1 2000aa b 1 emphasis added This text indicates that Congress believed that PPA protected materials would necessarily relate to a criminal offense as when investigators target the materials as evidence When agents collaterally seize PPA protected materials because they are commingled on a computer with other materials properly targeted by law enforcement however the PPA protected materials will not necessarily relate to any crime at all For example the PPA protected materials might be drafts of a horticulture newsletter that just happen to sit on the same hard drive as images of child pornography or records of a fraud scheme The Sixth Circuit has explicitly ruled that the incidental seizure of PPA protected material commingled on a suspect s computer with evidence of a crime does not give rise to PPA liability Guest v Leis 255 F 3d 325 6th Cir 2001 involved two lawsuits brought against the Sheriff s Department in Hamilton County Ohio The suits arose from the seizures of two servers that had been used to host bulletin board systems suspected of housing evidence and contraband relating to obscenity phone tapping child pornography credit card theft and software piracy The Sixth Circuit noted that when police execute a search warrant for documents on a computer it will often be difficult or impossible particularly without the cooperation of the owner to separate the offending materials from other innocent material on the computer at the site of the search Id at 341 42 Given these pragmatic concerns the court refused to find PPA liability for incidental seizures to construe the PPA otherwise would prevent police in many cases from seizing evidence located on a computer Id at 342 Instead the court held that when protected materials are commingled on a criminal suspect s computer with criminal evidence that is unprotected by the act we will not find liability under the PPA for seizure of the PPA protected materials Id The Guest court cautioned however that although the incidental seizure of PPA related work product and documentary materials did not violate the Act the subsequent search of such material was probably forbidden Id The Sixth Circuit s decision in Guest verifies that the suspect exception works as the legislature intended limiting the scope of PPA protection to the press and certain other persons not suspected of committing a crime S Rep No 96 874 at 4 1980 reprinted in 1980 U S C C A N 3950 At least one other court has also reached this result by broadly interpreting the suspect exception s phrase to which materials relate when an inadvertent seizure of commingled matter occurs See United States v Hunter 13 F Supp 2d 574 582 D Vt 1998 concluding that materials for weekly legal newsletter published by the defendant from his law office relate to the defendant s alleged involvement in his client s drug crimes when the former was inadvertently seized in a search for evidence of the latter See also Carpa v Smith 208 F 3d 220 2000 WL 189678 at 1 9th Cir Feb 8 2000 unpublished T he Privacy Protection Act does not apply to criminal suspects The Sixth Circuit s decision in Guest does not address the commingling issue when the owner of the seized computer is not a suspect In the only published decision to date directly addressing this issue a district court held the United States Secret Service liable for the inadvertent seizure of PPA protected materials See Steve Jackson Games Inc v Secret Service 816 F Supp 432 W D Tex 1993 aff d on other grounds 36 F 3d 457 5th Cir 1994 N 8 8 Steve Jackson Games Inc SJG was primarily a publisher of role playing games but it also operated a network of thirteen computers that provided its customers with e mail published information about SJG products and stored drafts of upcoming publications Believing that the system administrator of SJG s computers had stored evidence of crimes the Secret Service obtained a warrant and seized two of the thirteen computers connected to SJG s network in addition to other materials The Secret Service did not know that SJG s computers contained publishing materials until the day after the search However the Secret Service did not return the computers it seized until months later At no time did the Secret Service believe that SJG itself was involved in the crime under investigation The district court in Steve Jackson Games ruled that the Secret Service violated the PPA unfortunately the exact contours of the court s reasoning are difficult to discern For example the court did not explain exactly which of the materials the Secret Service seized were covered by the PPA instead the court merely recited the property that had been seized and concluded that some PPA protected materials were obtained during the search Id at 440 Similarly the court indicated that the search of SJG and the initial seizure of its property did not violate the PPA but that the Secret Service s continued retention of SJG s property after it learned of SJG s publisher status and despite a request by SJG for return of the property was the true source of the PPA violation something that the statute itself does not appear to contemplate See id at 441 The court also suggested that it might have ruled differently if the Secret Service had made copies of all information seized and returned the hardware as soon as possible but did not answer whether in fact it would have reached a different result in such case Id Incidental seizure of PPA protected materials on a non suspect s computer continues to be an uncertain area of the law in part because PPA issues are infrequently litigated As a practical matter agents can often avoid the seizure of PPA protected materials on a non suspect s computer by using a subpoena or process under ECPA to require the non suspect to produce the desired information as described in Chapter 3 To date no other court has followed the PPA approach of Steve Jackson Games See e g State v One 1 Pioneer CD ROM Changer 891 P 2d 600 607 Okla App 1995 questioning the apparent premise of Steve Jackson Games that the seizure of computer equipment could violate the PPA merely because the equipment also contained or was used to disseminate potential documentary materials Moreover even if courts eventually refuse to restrict the PPA to cases in which law enforcement intentionally seizes First Amendment material that is merely evidence of a crime courts may conclude that other PPA exceptions such as the contraband or fruits of a crime exception should be read as broadly as the Guest court read the suspect exception The additional handful of federal courts that have resolved civil suits filed under the PPA have ruled against the plaintiffs with little substantive analysis See e g Davis v Gracey 111 F 3d 1472 1482 10th Cir 1997 dismissing for lack of jurisdiction PPA suit improperly filed against municipal employees in their personal capacities Berglund v City of Maplewood 173 F Supp 2d 935 949 50 D Minn 2001 holding that the police seizure of a defendant s videotape fell under the criminal suspect and destruction of evidence exceptions to the PPA because the tape might have contained documentary evidence of the defendant s disorderly conduct DePugh v Sutton 917 F Supp 690 696 97 W D Mo 1996 rejecting pro se PPA challenge to seizure of materials relating to child pornography because there was probable cause to believe that the person possessing the materials committed the criminal offense to which the materials related aff d 104 F 3d 363 8th Cir 1996 Powell v Tordoff 911 F Supp 1184 1189 90 N D Iowa 1995 dismissing PPA claim because plaintiff did not have standing to challenge search and seizure under the Fourth Amendment See also Lambert v Polk County 723 F Supp 128 132 S D Iowa 1989 rejecting PPA claim after police seized videotape because officers could not reasonably believe that the owner of the tape had a purpose to disseminate the material to the public Agents and prosecutors who have reason to believe that a computer search may implicate the PPA should contact the Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section at 202 514 1026 or the CTC in their district see Introduction p ix for more specific guidance 3 Civil Liability Under the Electronic Communications Privacy Act When a search may result in the incidental seizure of network accounts belonging to innocent third parties agents should take every step to protect the integrity of the third party accounts to avoid potential ECPA liability When law enforcement executes a search of an Internet service provider and seizes the accounts of customers and subscribers those customers and subscribers may bring civil actions claiming that the search violated the Electronic Communications Privacy Act ECPA ECPA governs law enforcement access to the contents of electronic communications stored by third party service providers See 18 U S C 2703 Chapter 3 infra discussing the Electronic Communications Privacy Act In addition ECPA has a criminal provision that prohibits unauthorized access to electronic or wire communications in electronic storage See 18 U S C 2701 Chapter 3 infra discussing the definition of electronic storage The concern that a search executed pursuant to a valid warrant might violate ECPA derives from Steve Jackson Games Inc v Secret Service 816 F Supp 432 W D Tex 1993 discussed in Section B 2 c supra In Steve Jackson Games the district court held the Secret Service liable under ECPA after it seized reviewed and in some cases deleted stored electronic communications seized pursuant to a valid search warrant See id at 442 43 The court s holding appears to be rooted in the mistaken belief that ECPA requires that search warrants also comply with 18 U S C 2703 d and the various notice requirements of 2703 See id In fact ECPA makes quite clear that 2703 d and the notice requirements 2703 are implicated only when law enforcement does not obtain a search warrant Compare 18 U S C 2703 b 1 A with 18 U S C 2703 b 1 B See generally Chapter 3 infra Indeed the text of ECPA does not appear to contemplate civil liability for searches and seizures authorized by valid Rule 41 search warrants ECPA expressly authorizes government access to stored communications pursuant to a warrant issued under the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure see 18 U S C 2703 a b c 1 A Davis v Gracey 111 F 3d 1472 1483 10th Cir 1997 and the criminal prohibition of 2701 does not apply when access is authorized under 2703 See 18 U S C 2701 c 3 N 9 9 Further objectively reasonable good faith reliance on a warrant court order or statutory authorization is a complete defense to an ECPA violation See 18 U S C 2707 e Gracey 111 F 3d at 1484 applying good faith defense because seizure of stored communications incidental to a valid search was objectively reasonable Compare Steve Jackson Games 816 F Supp at 443 stating without explanation that the court declines to find this defense The best way to square the result in Steve Jackson Games with the plain language of ECPA is to exercise great caution when agents need to execute searches of Internet service providers and other third parties holding stored wire or electronic communications In most cases investigators will want to avoid a wholesale search and seizure of the provider s computers When investigators have no choice but to execute the search such as where the entity owning the system is suspected of deep involvement in the criminal conduct they must take special care For example if agents have reason to believe that they may seize customer accounts belonging to innocent persons but have no reason to believe that the evidence sought will be stored there they should inform the magistrate judge in the search warrant affidavit that they will not search those accounts and should take steps to ensure the confidentiality of the accounts in light of the privacy concerns expressed by 18 U S C 2703 Safeguarding the accounts of innocent persons absent specific reasons to believe that evidence may be stored in the persons accounts should satisfy the concerns expressed in Steve Jackson Games Compare Steve Jackson Games 816 F Supp at 441 finding ECPA liability where agents read the private communications of customers not involved in the crime and thereafter deleted or destroyed some communications either intentionally or accidentally with Gracey 111 F 3d at 1483 declining to find ECPA liability in seizure where p laintiffs have not alleged that the officers attempted to access or read the seized e mail and the officers disclaimed any interest in doing so If agents believe that a hacker or system administrator might have hidden evidence of a crime in the account of an innocent customer or subscriber agents should proceed carefully For example agents should inform the magistrate judge of their need to search the account in the affidavit and should attempt to obtain the consent of the customer or subscriber if feasible In such cases agents should contact the Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section at 202 514 1026 or the CTC designated in their district see Introduction p ix for more specific guidance 4 Considering the Need for Multiple Warrants in Network Searches Agents should obtain multiple warrants if they have reason to believe that a network search will retrieve data stored in multiple locations Fed R Crim P 41 a states that a magistrate judge located in one judicial district may issue a search warrant for a search of property within the district or a search of property outside the district if the property is within the district when the warrant is sought but might move outside the district before the warrant is executed The Supreme Court has held that property as described in Rule 41 includes intangible property such as computer data See United States v New York Tel Co 434 U S 159 170 1977 Although the courts have not directly addressed the matter the language of Rule 41 combined with the Supreme Court s interpretation of property may limit searches of computer data to data that resides in the district in which the warrant was issued N 10 10 Cf United States v Walters 558 F Supp 726 730 D Md 1980 suggesting such a limit in a case involving telephone records A territorial limit on searches of computer data poses problems for law enforcement because computer data stored in a computer network can be located anywhere in the world For example agents searching an office in Manhattan pursuant to a warrant from the Southern District of New York may sit down at a terminal and access information stored remotely on a computer located in New Jersey California or even a foreign country A single file described by the warrant could be located anywhere on the planet or could be divided up into several locations in different districts or countries Even worse it may be impossible for agents to know when they execute their search whether the data they are seizing has been stored within the district or outside of the district Agents may in some cases be able to learn where the data is located before the search but in others they will be unable to know the storage site of the data until after the search has been completed When agents can learn prior to the search that some or all of the data described by the warrant is stored in a different location than where the agents will execute the search the best course of action depends upon where the remotely stored data is located When the data is stored remotely in two or more different places within the United States and its territories agents should obtain additional warrants for each location where the data resides to ensure compliance with a strict reading of Rule 41 a For example if the data is stored in two different districts agents should obtain separate warrants from the two districts Agents should also include a thorough explanation of the location of the data and the proposed means of conducting the search in the affidavits accompanying the warrants When agents learn before a search that some or all of the data is stored remotely outside of the United States matters become more complicated The United States may be required to take actions ranging from informal notice to a formal request for assistance to the country concerned Further some countries may object to attempts by U S law enforcement to access computers located within their borders Although the search may seem domestic to a U S law enforcement officer executing the search in the United States pursuant to a valid warrant other countries may view matters differently Agents and prosecutors should contact the Office of International Affairs at 202 514 0000 for assistance with these difficult questions When agents do not and even cannot know that data searched from one district is actually located outside the district evidence seized remotely from another district ordinarily should not lead to suppression of the evidence obtained The reasons for this are twofold First courts may conclude that agents sitting in one district who search a computer in that district and unintentionally cause intangible information to be sent from a second district into the first have complied with Rule 41 a Cf United States v Ramirez 112 F 3d 849 852 7th Cir 1997 Posner C J adopting a permissive construction of the territoriality provisions of Title III United States v Denman 100 F 3d 399 402 5th Cir 1996 same United States v Rodriguez 968 F 2d 130 135 36 2d Cir 1992 same Second even if courts conclude that the search violates Rule 41 a the violation will not lead to suppression of the evidence unless the agents intentionally and deliberately disregarded the Rule or the violation leads to prejudice in the sense that the search might not have occurred or would not have been so abrasive if the Rule had been followed See United States v Burke 517 F 2d 377 386 2d Cir 1975 Friendly J United States v Martinez Zayas 857 F 2d 122 136 3d Cir 1988 citing cases Under the widely adopted Burke test courts generally deny motions to suppress when agents executing the search cannot know whether it violates Rule 41 either legally or factually See Martinez Zayas 857 F 2d at 136 concluding that a search passed the Burke test g iven the uncertain state of the law concerning whether the conduct violated Rule 41 a Accordingly evidence acquired from a network search that accessed data stored in multiple districts should not lead to suppression unless the agents intentionally and deliberately disregarded Rule 41 a or prejudice resulted See generally United States v Trost 152 F 3d 715 722 7th Cir 1998 I t is difficult to anticipate any violation of Rule 41 short of a defect that also offends the Warrant Clause of the fourth amendment that would call for suppression 5 No Knock Warrants As a general matter agents must announce their presence and authority prior to executing a search warrant See Wilson v Arkansas 514 U S 927 934 1995 18 U S C 3109 This so called knock and announce rule reduces the risk of violence and destruction of property when agents execute a search The rule is not absolute however In Richards v Wisconsin 520 U S 385 1997 the Supreme Court held that agents can dispense with the knock and announce requirement if they have a reasonable suspicion that knocking and announcing their presence under the particular circumstances would be dangerous or futile or that it would inhibit the effective investigation of the crime by for example allowing the destruction of evidence Id at 394 The Court stated that this showing was not high but the police should be required to make it whenever the reasonableness of a no knock entry is challenged Id at 394 95 Such a showing satisfies both the Fourth Amendment and the statutory knock and announce rule of 18 U S C 3109 See United States v Ramirez 523 U S 65 71 73 1998 Agents may need to conduct no knock searches in computer crime cases because technically adept suspects may hot wire their computers in an effort to destroy evidence For example technically adept computer hackers have been known to use hot keys computer programs that destroy evidence when a special button is pressed If agents knock at the door to announce their search the suspect can simply press the button and activate the program to destroy the evidence When agents have reason to believe that knocking and announcing their presence would allow the destruction of evidence would be dangerous or would be futile agents should request that the magistrate judge issue a no knock warrant The failure to obtain judicial authorization to dispense with the knock and announce rule does not preclude the agents from conducting a no knock search however In some cases agents may neglect to request a no knock warrant or may not have reasonable suspicion that evidence will be destroyed until they execute the search In Richards the Supreme Court made clear that the reasonableness of the officers decision to dispense with the knock and announce rule must be evaluated as of the time they entered the area to be searched Richards 520 U S at 395 Accordingly agents may exercise independent judgment and decide to conduct a no knock search when they execute the search even if they did not request such authority or the magistrate judge specifically refused to authorize a no knock search Id at 396 n 7 The question in all such cases is whether the agents had a reasonable suspicion that knocking and announcing their presence under the particular circumstances would be dangerous or futile or that it would inhibit the effective investigation of the crime by for example allowing the destruction of evidence Id at 394 6 Sneak and Peek Warrants If certain conditions are met a court may authorize so called surreptitious entry warrants or sneak and peek warrants that excuse agents from having to notify the person whose premises are searched at the time of the search Under 18 U S C 3103a as amended by the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001 213 Pub L No 107 56 115 Stat 272 2001 a court may grant the delay of notice associated with the execution of a search warrant if it finds reasonable cause to believe that providing immediate notification of the execution of the warrant may have one of the adverse effects enumerated in 18 U S C 2705 endangering the life or physical safety of an individual flight from prosecution evidence tampering witness intimidation or otherwise seriously jeopardizing an investigation or unduly delaying a trial This standard may reduce some of the inconsistencies among jurisdictions in rules governing sneak and peek warrants that existed prior to the PATRIOT Act CompareUnited States v Simons 206 F 3d 392 403 4th Cir 2000 45 day delay in notice of execution of warrant does not render search unconstitutional with United States v Freitas 800 F 2d 1451 1456 9th Cir 1986 warrant constitutionally defective for failing to provide explicitly for notice within a reasonable but short time Furthermore under section 3103a law enforcement authorities must provide delayed notice within a reasonable period following a warrant s execution but the court can further delay notification for good cause Reasonable period is a flexible standard to meet the circumstances of each individual case Cf United States v Villegas 899 F 2d 1324 1337 2d Cir 1990 noting prior to the amendment of section 3103a that w hat constitutes a reasonable time will depend on the circumstances of each individual case Courts deciding this issue prior to the amendment of the statute have made different rulings on what period of delay is reasonable United States v Simons 206 F 3d 392 403 4th Cir 2000 45 day delay in notice of execution of warrant does not render search unconstitutional Villegas 899 F 2d at 1337 seven day initial delay reasonable subject to extensions United States v Freitas 800 F 2d 1451 1456 9th Cir 1986 Such time should not exceed seven days except upon a strong showing of necessity The provision distinguishes between delaying notice of a search and delaying notice of a seizure Indeed unless the court finds reasonable necessity for a seizure warrants issued under this section must prohibit the seizure of any tangible property any wire or electronic communication or any stored wire or electronic information except as expressly provided in chapter 121 Congress intended that if investigators intended to make surreptitious copies of information stored on a suspect s computer they would obtain authorization from the court in advance Prosecutors should exercise discretion and obtain the approval of a supervisory official within their office before seeking delayed notice warrants or orders In addition every attempt should be made to ensure that the period of delayed notice will be as brief as is reasonably possible The Executive Office of United States Attorneys should also be notified about such warrants For more information regarding this provision prosecutors and investigators should contact the Office of Enforcement Operations Criminal Division at 202 514 0746 or 202 514 3684 7 Privileged Documents Agents must exercise special care when planning a computer search that may result in the seizure of legally privileged documents such as medical records or attorney client communications Two issues must be considered First agents should make sure that the search will not violate the Attorney General s regulations relating to obtaining confidential information from disinterested third parties Second agents should devise a strategy for reviewing the seized computer files following the search so that no breach of a privilege occurs a The Attorney General s Regulations Relating to Searches of Disinterested Lawyers Physicians and Clergymen Agents should be very careful if they plan to search the office of a doctor lawyer or member of the clergy who is not implicated in the crime under investigation At Congress s direction the Attorney General has issued guidelines for federal officers who want to obtain documentary materials from such disinterested third parties See 42 U S C 2000aa 11 a 28 C F R 59 4 b Under these rules federal law enforcement officers should not use a search warrant to obtain documentary materials believed to be in the private possession of a disinterested third party physician lawyer or clergyman where the material sought or likely to be reviewed during the execution of the warrant contains confidential information on patients clients or parishioners 28 C F R 59 4 b The regulation does contain a narrow exception A search warrant can be used if using less intrusive means would substantially jeopardize the availability or usefulness of the materials sought access to the documentary materials appears to be of substantial importance to the investigation and the application for the warrant has been recommended by the U S Attorney and approved by the appropriate Deputy Assistant Attorney General See 28 C F R 59 4 b 1 and 2 When planning to search the offices of a lawyer under investigation agents should follow the guidelines offered in the United States Attorney s Manual and should consult the Office of Enforcement Operations at 202 514 3684 See generally United States Attorney s Manual 9 13 420 1997 b Strategies for Reviewing Privileged Computer Files Agents contemplating a search that may result in the seizure of legally privileged computer files should devise a post seizure strategy for screening out the privileged files and should describe that strategy in the affidavit When agents seize a computer that contains legally privileged files a trustworthy third party must comb through the files to separate those files within the scope of the warrant from files that contain privileged material After reviewing the files the third party will offer those files within the scope of the warrant to the prosecution team Preferred practices for determining who will comb through the files vary widely among different courts In general however there are three options First the court itself may review the files in camera Second the presiding judge may appoint a neutral third party known as a special master to the task of reviewing the files Third a team of prosecutors or agents who are not working on the case may form a taint team or privilege team to help execute the search and review the files afterwards The taint team sets up a so called Chinese Wall between the evidence and the prosecution team permitting only unprivileged files that are within the scope of the warrant to slip through the wall Because a single computer can store millions of files judges will undertake in camera review of computer files only rarely See Black v United States 172 F R D 511 516 17 S D Fla 1997 accepting in camera review given unusual circumstances United States v Skeddle 989 F Supp 890 893 N D Ohio 1997 declining in camera review Instead the typical choice is between using a taint team and a special master Most prosecutors will prefer to use a taint team if the court consents A taint team can usually screen through the seized computer files fairly quickly whereas special masters often take several years to complete their review See Black 172 F R D at 514 n 4 On the other hand some courts have expressed discomfort with taint teams See United States v Neill 952 F Supp 834 841 D D C 1997 United States v Hunter 13 F Supp 2d 574 583 n 2 D Vt 1998 stating that review by a magistrate judge or special master may be preferable to reliance on a taint team citing In re Search Warrant 153 F R D 55 59 S D N Y 1994 Although no single standard has emerged courts have generally indicated that evidence screened by a taint team will be admissible only if the government shows that its procedures adequately protected the defendants rights and no prejudice occurred See e g Neill 952 F Supp at 840 42 Hunter 13 F Supp 2d at 583 One approach to limit the amount of potentially privileged material in dispute is to have defense counsel review the output of the taint team to identify those documents for which counsel intends to raise a claim of privilege Files thus identified that do not seem relevant to the investigation need not be litigated Although this approach may not be appropriate in every case magistrates may appreciate the fact that defense counsel has been given the chance to identify potential claims before the court decides what to provide to the prosecution team In unusual circumstances the court may conclude that a taint team would be inadequate and may appoint a special master to review the files See e g United States v Abbell 914 F Supp 519 S D Fla 1995 DeMassa v Nunez 747 F 2d 1283 9th Cir 1984 In any event the reviewing authority will almost certainly need a skilled and neutral technical expert to assist in sorting identifying and analyzing digital evidence for the reviewing process toc Table of Contents C Drafting the Warrant and Affidavit Law enforcement officers must draft two documents to obtain a search warrant from a magistrate judge The first document is the affidavit a sworn statement that at a minimum explains the basis for the affiant s belief that the search is justified by probable cause The second document is the proposed warrant itself The proposed warrant typically is a one page form plus attachments incorporated by reference that describes the place to be searched and the persons or things to be seized If the magistrate judge agrees that the affidavit establishes probable cause and that the proposed warrant s descriptions of the place to be searched and things to be seized are adequately particular the magistrate judge will sign the warrant Under the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure officers must execute the warrant within ten days after the warrant has been signed See Fed R Crim P 41 b In general there are three steps involved in drafting the warrant and affidavit First the warrant and or its attachments must accurately and particularly describe the property to be seized Second the affidavit must establish probable cause Third the affidavit should include an explanation of the search strategy These three components are discussed below Step 1 Accurately and Particularly Describe the Property to be Seized in the Warrant and or Attachments to the Warrant a General Agents must take special care when describing the computer files or hardware to be seized either in the warrant itself or more likely in an attachment to the warrant incorporated into the warrant by reference The Fourth Amendment requires that every warrant must particularly describ e the things to be seized U S Const Amend IV The particularity requirement prevents law enforcement from executing general warrants that permit exploratory rummaging through a person s belongings in search of evidence of a crime Coolidge v New Hampshire 403 U S 443 467 1971 The particularity requirement has two distinct elements See United States v Upham 168 F 3d 532 535 1st Cir 1999 First the warrant must describe the things to be seized with sufficiently precise language so that it tells the officers how to separate the items properly subject to seizure from irrelevant items See Marron v United States 275 U S 192 296 1925 As to what is to be taken nothing is left to the discretion of the officer executing the warrant Davis v Gracey 111 F 3d 1472 1478 10th Cir 1997 Second the description of the things to be seized must not be so broad that it encompasses items that should not be seized See Upham 168 F 3d at 535 Put another way the description in the warrant of the things to be seized should be limited to the scope of the probable cause established in the warrant See In re Grand Jury Investigation Concerning Solid State Devices 130 F 3d 853 857 9th Cir 1997 Considered together the elements forbid agents from obtaining general warrants and instead require agents to conduct narrow seizures that attempt to minimize unwarranted intrusions upon privacy Andresen v Maryland 427 U S 463 482 n 11 1976 b Warrants to Seize Hardware vs Warrants to Seize Information If computer hardware is contraband evidence fruits or instrumentalities of crime the warrant should describe the hardware itself If the probable cause relates only to information however the warrant should describe the information rather than the physical storage devices which happen to contain it The most important decision agents must make when describing the property in the warrant is whether the seizable property according to Rule 41 is the computer hardware itself or merely the information that the hardware contains If the computer hardware is itself contraband an instrumentality of crime or evidence the focus of the warrant should be on the computer hardware itself and not on the information it contains The warrant should describe the hardware and indicate that the hardware will be seized See e g Davis v Gracey 111 F 3d 1472 1480 10th Cir 1997 seizure of computer equipment used to store obscene pornography was proper because the equipment was an instrumentality However if the probable cause relates in whole or in part to information stored on the computer the warrant should focus on the content of the relevant files rather than on the storage devices which may happen to contain them See e g United States v Gawrysiak 972 F Supp 853 860 D N J 1997 aff d 178 F 3d 1281 3d Cir 1999 upholding seizure of records that include inform
