shortly before the 50th anniversary of powered flight Crossfield piloted the Douglas D 558 II Skyrocket research aircraft to Mach 2 twice the speed of sound or more than 1 290 mph Crossfield s milestone in aeronautical history came at a time when the U S Air Force the U S Navy and the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics NACA for who Crossfield flew as a research pilot were pushing the frontiers of flight flying a stable of exotic experimental research airplanes from Edwards Air Force Base in Southern California s high desert The 50th anniversary of the Wright Brothers first powered flight was coming up Crossfield remembered The Air Force was going to celebrate the 50th anniversary with another Mach number We thought it would be kind of cute if we beat the Air Force to Mach 2 in the Navy airplane Newsroom NewsReleases 2003 03 57 html Full Story Solar Storms Smoke Dryden Augments ISS Communications Sunspots visible through a smoke filled sky As smoke from the Simi
