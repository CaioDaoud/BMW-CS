account must fill out an Account Request form every year for the annual NOP new operational period http www nas nasa gov User Helpdesk userforms html Hard Copy Account Request Form https www nas nasa gov User Onramp onramp html Online Account Request Form For the current 2004 NOP guidelines for principal investigators and users are as follows Principal Investigators PI The PI must complete a project cover sheet obtain approval from the resource manager and return the form When the approved project cover sheet is received your project will be assigned a Group Identification Number GID Please provide the GID to your users so they can complete their account request form s Both you and the user s must sign and submit these forms All requests for SGI Origin time will be for CPU hours instead of node hours as in previous years Users Each user must complete a new account request form for each group number GID you wish to be part of Have your PI sign the form before you submit it You must also sign and return the acceptable use Acceptable Use Statement located on page 2 of the Account Request form Note International Visitors are required to complete additional paperwork as outlined on the User Helpdesk Forms international intro html account request for international visitors page Be aware that international visitors can expect long delays in the approval process in some cases these delays could take months Acceptable Use Statement On the Account Request form the Acceptable Use Statement for the NASA Advanced Supercomputing Division states The following document outlines guidelines for use of the computing systems resources and facilities located at and or operated by the NASA Advanced Supercomputing NAS Division at NASA Ames Research Center The purpose of these guidelines is increase awareness of computer security issues and to ensure that all NAS users scientific users support personnel and management use the NAS Systems Division computing systems resources and facilities in an efficient ethical and lawful manner NAS accounts are to be used only for the purpose for which they are authorized and are not to be used for non NASA related activities Unauthorized use of a NAS Division account system is in violation of Section 799 Title 18 U S Code and constitutes theft and is punishable by law Therefore unauthorized use of NAS Systems Division computing system s resources and facilities may constitute grounds for either civil or criminal prosecution In the text below users refers to users of any IN supported computing systems resources and facilities Users are responsible for using the computing systems resources and facilities in an efficient and effective manner Account deactivation will result after 60 days of non use and data will be deleted after 90 days unless the user project contacts the Help Desk to preserve their data The computing systems are unclassified systems Therefore classified information may not be processed entered or stored Information is considered classified if it is Top Secret and or Confidential information which requires safeguarding in the interest of National Security Users are responsible for protecting any information used and or stored on in their accounts Consult the User Guide for guidelines on protecting your account and information using the standard system protection mechanisms Users are required to report any weaknesses in computer security any incidents of possible misuse or violation of this agreement to the proper authorities by contacting NAS User Services or by sending electronic mail to security nas nasa gov Users shall not attempt to access any data or programs contained on systems for which they do not have authorization or explicit consent of the owner of the data program the NAS Division Chief or the NAS Data Processing Installation Automated Information Security Official DPI AISO Users shall not divulge access information e g Dialup or Dialback modem phone numbers or lists of user accounts Users shall not share their account s with anyone This includes sharing the password to the account providing access via an rhost entry or other means of sharing Users shall not make unauthorized copies of copyrighted software except as permitted by law or by the owner of the copyright Users shall not make copies of system configuration files e g etc passwd for unauthorized personal use or to provide to other people users for unauthorized uses Users shall not purposely engage in activities to harass other users degrade the performance of systems deprive an authorized user access to a resource obtain extra resources beyond those allocated circumvent computer security measures or gain access to a system for which proper authorization has not been given Electronic communication facilities such as E mail or Netnews are for authorized government use only Fraudulent harassing obscene or sexually explicit messages and or materials shall not be sent from or stored on the systems Users shall not download install or run security programs or utilities which reveal weaknesses in the security of a system For example NAS users shall not run password cracking programs Inclusion of a login name different than your NAS login name in your rhost file requires a written request and approval from the NAS DPI AISO If a name different than your NAS login name is found in a rhost file without approval your account will be disabled NAS Staff Account Hourly Limits For the 2002 NAS staff NOP the goal was to reduce compute engine usage by the staff to less than 10 percent of the total hours available This is an informal agreement with the funding programs To ensure that this goal is met for 2003 a limit of 10 000 hours on staff GIDs has been set If you or your group needs more hours submit a regular request for a scientific GID You will then be assigned one of the NAS GIDs Account Deactivation Users who do not comply with the rules listed in the acceptable use Acceptable Use Statement will have their accounts disabled either temporarily or permanently Account deactivation will result after 60 days of non use by changing user s normal shell to noshell and data may be archived after 90 days of non use Password Policies Initial Password Setup If you are a new user and don t know your default installation password please call the NAS Help Desk at 1 800 331 USER 8737 or 1 650 604 4444 Note Due to security requirements you must call from the phone number listed on your account request form to get your password If your phone number has changed due to office moves or reorganizations your PI must contact the Help Desk stating the reason for the change via phone or FAX The FAX number is 650 604 1777 If you already have an account on a NAS system and you are approved to get an account on another machine your password on the new machine is your current lou password If you do not remember this password see Forgotten Passwords below Forgotten Passwords Follow one of the procedures below to obtain your password If you have forgotten your password on a NAS system but you know the password for your account on lou the NAS mass storage system call NAS User Services at 1 800 331 USER 1 800 331 8737 or 650 604 4444 and request that your default password on the NAS system be set to your lou password This normally takes about 15 minutes to activate If you have forgotten your password and do not have a working lou password you must call NAS User Services from the phone number you provided on your Account Request form A NAS User Services representative will call you back at that number with your temporary default password See above note under password Initial Password Setup Once you re logged into the computer you must change your password immediately If you have forgotten your password and your work phone number has changed your principal investigator PI must contact NAS User Services See above note under password Initial Password Setup If your PI is unavailable your branch chief or division chief may do this for you Password Creation Rules Follow the rules below when creating your NAS passwords A password must contain a minimum of 8 characters It must contain one character each from at least three of the following character sets uppercase letters lowercase letters numbers and special characters Use non trivial passwords examples of trivial passwords that you may not use include but are not limited to your user ID a dictionary word of any language or a dictionary word with numbers appended or prepended to it a password either wholly or predominately composed of the following user ID owner name birthdate Social Security Number family member or pet s name name spelled backwards or other personal information a contractor name a division or branch name Repetitive or keyboard patterns for example abc ABC 1234 qwer mnbvc aaa aaaa The name of any automobile or sport team the name of any vendor product or nickname for a product Passwords must be changed every 90 days Passwords may not be re used Policies for PBS and Running Jobs on the SGI Origin Systems Interactive Jobs The front end system for the Origin cluster Turing allows users to get quick turnaround while performing the following tasks file editing file management short debugging and testing sessions and batch job submission to Hopper O2K Hypatia O2K Steger O2K Dawn O2K Lomax O3K and Chapman O3K Running long and or large in terms of memory and or number of processors debugging or production jobs interactively or in the background of Turing is considered to be inconsiderate behavior to the rest of the user community If you need help submitting such jobs to the batch systems please see http www nas nasa gov User Systemsdocs O3K runningjobs html batch Running Batch Jobs or contact a NAS scientific consultant at 1 800 331 USER or 650 604 4444 or send e mail to mailto support nas nasa gov support nas nasa gov Jobs that cause significant impact onTuring are candidates for removal in order to bring the system back to a normal load and environment for all users A cron job regularly monitors the system load and determines if job removal is necessary If your job is removed you will receive an e mail notice The criteria for job removal are explained below The number of processors a job uses is greater than or equal to a predefined number that is a function of the system load For example when the system load is 0 this predefined number is 8 if the system load is 50 this number is 4 if the system load is 100 this number is 1 So when system load is low only jobs that use large number of processors will be selected for removal On the other hand when the system load is high any job even 1 CPU jobs will be considered for removal The CPU time usage of each process in a job has on average exceeded a threshold defined as 20 minutes x 8 number of processes for the job That is a baseline for removal is a job with 8 processors running for more than 20 minutes The maximum amount of time each processor in a job is allowed is scaled using 20 min x 8 number of processes for the job If a user has three jobs removed by the cronjob in one day he or she will not be allowed to run interactive jobs for three days That is as soon as the fourth job is detected it will be removed The conditions of removal are subject to change as necessary Job Charging for Origins only Jobs are charged in System Units SUs The SU is measured in normalized wall clock hours on the SGI Origins There is a difference in the clock speeds for the various Origin processors to make things more equitable the SUs are normalized based on the old Lomax O2K 400 MHz CPU For example if you use 16 CPUs for 1 hour on the new Lomax a 400 MHz O3K you will be charged 16 1 2 SUs for use of 16 CPUs for an hour on steger you will only be charged 16 0 5 8 SUs The table below outlines the CPU factorization Host CPU Factor chapman

Time Except for the compute system Hopper Hypatia and Steger the maximum wall time a user can request for a job to run in the regular queue are a 2 hours during prime time b 8 hours during non prime time for Dawn and Lomax and 6 hours for Chapman The definitions of prime time and non prime time are Hopper Effectively Nov 4 2002 prime time and non prime time are no longer implemented on this machine Users can submit and run jobs that request up to 100 hours of wall time Each user can have more than one running job so long as running the ADDITIONAL job will not push the combined CPU usage of that user s currently running jobs over the limit of 32 out of the 124 available CPUs on hopper Note that the restriction applies only to the second and each subsequent concurrently running job on hopper Hypatia Effectively Dec 2 2003 prime time and non prime time are not implemented on this machine Users can submit and run jobs that request up to 100 hours of wall time Each user can have more than one running job so long as running the ADDITIONAL job will not push the combined CPU usage of that user s currently running jobs over the limit of 16 out of the 60 available CPUs on Hypatia Note that the restriction applies only to the second and each subsequent concurrently running job on Hypatia Steger Effectively Dec 2 2003 prime time and non prime time are no longer implemented on this

On the compute systems Hopper Hypatia Steger Dawn Lomax and Chapman resources are allocated to users in integral node units One node has two processors on the O2K four processors on the O3K and a fixed amount of memory This means that once a user is allocated a node that user has exclusive access to that node and all the resources on the node such as memory until the user s job completes or exceeds its requested wall clock time For Hopper Hypatia and Steger all jobs are assigned some multiple of 2 CPUs and the minimum number of CPUs given to a user s job is 2 For Dawn all jobs are assigned some multiple of 4 CPUs so the minimum number of CPUs that a job will be assigned is 4 For Lomax and Chapman all jobs are assigned some multiple of 16 CPUs so the minimum number of CPUs that a job will be assigned is 16 Files and Disks Policies To comply with NASA security requirements new policies regarding users files and directories have been implemented effective November 1 2002 ITAR Export Control The principal investigator PI must indicate on the project cover sheet the classification of data based upon NASA s risk assessment criteria There are five categories of data MSN Mission Information MSN BRT Business and Restricted Technology Information BRT SER Scientific Engineering and Research Information SER ADM Administrative Information ADM PUB Public Access Information PUB The PI must by law manage protect and control the export of the project s data in a way that complies with the security category of the data Notes Mission Information requires the most stringent security control and protection Currently the NAS Facility is not configured to provide services for this type of data For Business and Restricted Technology Information which includes ITAR Export Control Data no world access write read execute is allowed Detailed descriptions of each data categories are as follows Mission Information MSN If the information software applications or computer systems in this category are altered destroyed or unavailable the impact on NASA could be catastrophic The result could be the loss of major or unique assets a threat to human life or prevention of NASA from preparing or training for a critical Agency mission Examples in this category are those that control or directly support one of the following Human space flight Wide Area Networks Development of the data or software used to control human flight Training simulation vehicles Wind tunnel operations Launch operations Space vehicle operations Business and Restricted Technology Information BRT This category consists of information that NASA is required by law to protect It includes information software applications or computer systems that support the Agency s business and technological needs In general if information in this category should be disclosed inappropriately the disclosure could result in damage to our employees in loss of business for our partners and customer businesses in contract protest or the illegal export of technology This category includes systems containing technological information that is restricted from general public disclosure because of public laws Examples in this category are those that are related to the following kinds of information Financial Legal Payroll Personnel Procurement Source selection Proprietary information entrusted to the Government Export controlled technical information includes disclosure to foreign nationals Scientific Engineering and Research Information SER All official NASA information held by NASA employees may be released publicly only in accordance with NASA regulations however systems in this category do not contain information for which the release is otherwise governed by law This category consists of information that supports basic research engineering and technology development but is less restricted against public disclosure Alteration destruction unauthorized disclosure or unavailability of the systems application or information would have an adverse or severe impact on individual projects scientists or engineers however recovery would not impede the Agency in accomplishing a primary mission Integrity is the driving concern in this category followed by availability Confidentiality is important and should be considered in a risk assessment insofar as it protects individual researchers from such things as premature disclosure of their work by another party The impact however is primarily on an individual rather than on the Agency Administrative Information ADM Administrative Information includes but is not limited to electronic correspondence briefing information project program status infrastructure design details predecisional notes vulnerability descriptions passwords and internet protocol addresses Organizations run various applications from problem reports to configuration management tools on administrative IT systems This category includes systems applications and information that support NASA s daily activities such as electronic mail forms processing networking and management reporting Integrity and availability are the driving IT security concerns The impact is primarily managerial in nature which would require time and resources to correct Confidentiality may be of concern in certain specific administrative information In such instances additional security controls must be imposed as a risk analysis dictates Public Access Information PUB This category includes information software applications and computer systems specifically intended for public use or disclosure such as a public web site or hands on demonstrations The loss alteration or unavailability of information in this category would have little direct impact on NASA s missions but might expose the Agency to embarrassment loss of credibility or public ridicule Information posted for public access which could expose NASA missions to risk if compromised should be afforded additional protective measures In these cases the baseline requirements for ADM information should be implemented For example contractors may submit proposals based on information from NASA web sites Loss alteration or unavailability of data at the site could result in protests thereby impacting procurement cycle time and ultimately NASA missions Integrity and availability are the driving concerns IT security controls are selected to protect the resources themselves and are not intended to protect the confidentiality of the information File and Directory Permissions Write permission is granted only to the file owner That is files and directories may not be writable by group and or others unless there is a valid justification By default files and directories are set with owner permissions To request write permissions for members of your group or others your principal investigator PI must submit a valid justification by calling 1 800 331 USER or 1 650 604 4444 or by sending an e mail to support nas nasa gov The request will be reviewed by the NAS security officer For directories if a world write permission is approved by the security officer the sticky bit must be set also chmod t on that directory to prevent an unprivileged user from deleting or renaming files of other users in that directory File and directory permissions are routinely scanned for violation of this policy For those files directories that are permitted by the security officer to be writable by group and or others they will be recorded on an exception list SUID SGI Shell Scripts Users are prohibited from creating and using privileged SUID and or SGID scripts under their home scratch nobackup and tmp filesystems SUID scripts that is with permission u s and SGID scripts with permission g s could allow someone other than the owner to gain unauthorized access to users files posing a security hazard Note The IT Origin cluster systems at the NAS Facility are configured to disable the execution of any SUID SGID shell scripts Disk Quotas On some file systems quotas may be enforced on either the disk space and or the number of inodes For example the disk space quota for each user s home filesystem on Turing has a soft limit of 600 000 kilobytes KB and a hard limit of 800 000 KB Currently no limits have been set on the inodes on Turing s home filesystem Other scratch or nobackup filesystems may also have quota limits When the hard limit is exceeded you will no longer be able to write to that filesystem If the soft limit is exceeded for more than 7 consecutive days it is treated as if the hard limit has been reached further requests for space will produce an error Skulker Policy on the Origins scratch and nobackup filesystems Skulkers are programs to remove excess files Files on any scratch nobackup directory are subject to removal by a NAS skulker when the scratch nobackup filesystem becomes 90 full Users are responsible for copying important files to their home filesystems or the mass storage system Lou Once the scratch1 and scratch2 or the nobackup1 nobackup2 filesystems are 90 full the skulker program will remove files in descending order by size that are larger than 16 KB and have not been used in 7 days until usage drops to 80 full You will receive an e mail if your file was removed by skulker Note At times when a system is critically short of disk space the NAS system administrators may manually run the skulker program with increasingly stringent arguments until it reclaims enough space Under such circumstances files less than 1 week old may also be candidates for removal A safe practice is to always copy files that you want to keep to your home filesystem or to Lou If a file is lost or removed from scratch nobackup filesystems don t expect that it can be restored Home Filesystem Backups The home filesystems are the only user filesystems that are backed up almost daily For files that are unintentionally removed you can request to restore a file by calling the NAS Helpdesk at 1 800 331 USER 8737 or 1 650 604 4444 or by sending an e mail to mailto support nas nasa gov support nas nasa
