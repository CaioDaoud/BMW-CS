monitoring institutional compliance with the PHS regulation on research misconduct The Assurance Program ensures that PHS research and research training support is awarded only to eligible institutions The names of institutions that have an assurance are maintained in a database that is automatically run against applications submitted by institutions to determine funding eligibility A computer bar prevents the processing of awards to ineligible institutions An institution is eligible when it has an assurance on file with ORI stating that is has developed and will comply with an administrative process for responding to allegations of research misconduct in PHS supported research that complies with the PHS regulation An institution establishes an assurance when an official signs the face page of the PHS grant application form or when the institution files a separate assurance form Once established institutions maintain their assurance by filing the Annual Report on Possible Research Misconduct submitting their policy for responding to allegations of research misconduct for review when requested by ORI revising their policy when requested by ORI to bring the policy into compliance with the PHS regulation and complying with the PHS regulation The Compliance Review Program ensures that institutions comply with their policy and the PHS regulation in responding to allegations of research misconduct In addition the Compliance Review Program responds to retaliation complaints from whistleblowers and monitors the implementation of PHS administrative actions by institutions and PHS agencies bullet smallorgstatement asp Small Organization Statement bullet aronpossibleresearchmis asp Annual Report on Possible Research Misconduct bullet publications
