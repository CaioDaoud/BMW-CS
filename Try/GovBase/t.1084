the Front Range storm 9 March 92 Introduction The Local Analysis and Prediction Branch performs high resolution analyses and forecasts of the weather using both locally and centrally available meteorological observations The LAPB Branch is a component of http www noaa gov NOAA s Forecast Systems Laboratory The Local Analysis and Prediction System LAPS integrates data from virtually every meteorological observation system into a very high resolution gridded framework centered on a forecast office s domain of responsibility Thus the data from local mesonetworks of surface observing systems Doppler radars satellites wind and temperature RASS profilers 404 and boundary layer 915 MHz as well as aircraft are incorporated every hour into a three dimensional grid covering a 1040km by 1240km area LAPS has analysis and prediction components The prediction component is being configured using the http rams atmos colostate edu RAMS http www mmm ucar edu mm5 mm5 home html MM5 http wrf
