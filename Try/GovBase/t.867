Porter In the November issue of Optics Express National Institute of Standards and Technology NIST scientists describe a novel combination of microscopes that can peer deep into tissue engineering scaffolds and monitor the growth and differentiation of cells ultimately intended to develop into implantable organs or other body part replacements The new dual imaging tool provides a much needed capability for the emerging tissue engineering field which aims to regenerate form and function in damaged or diseased tissues and organs Until now scrutiny of this complicated three dimensional process has been limited to the top most layers of the scaffolds used to coax and sustain cell development Composed of biodegradable polymers or other building materials scaffolds are seeded with cells that grow multiply and assemble into three dimensional tissues Whether the cells respond and organize as intended in this synthetic environment depends greatly on the composition properties and architecture of the scaffolds porous interiors Tools for simultaneously monitoring microstructure and cellular activity can help scientists to tease apart the essentials of this interactive relationship In turn such knowledge can speed development of tissue engineered products ranging from skin replacements to substitute livers to inside the body treatments of osteoporosis NIST scientist Joy Dunkers and her colleagues paired an optical coherence microscope a high resolution probe of the scaffold interior with a confocal fluorescence microscope used to track cells stained with a fluorescent dye The instruments provide simultaneous images that can be merged to create a comprehensive rendering of microstructure and cellular activity By stacking the sectional images they can create a top to bottom movie showing structural and cellular details throughout the scaffold s volume J P Dunkers M T Cicerone and N R Washburn Collinear optical coherence and confocal fluorescence

Drives The next time you try to watch a homemade movie or access your files from a recordable DVD on your computer s DVD drive you might be in for an unpleasant surprise It might not work Initial tests conducted by researchers at the National Institute of Standards and Technology in collaboration with the DVD Association and the Optical Storage Technology Association show that compatibility between recordable DVDs and DVD drives is only 85 percent This means that if a recording is made on 10 different brands of DVDs the odds are that at least one will not work The problematic results range from DVDs that do not work at all suddenly freeze or have video or audio drop out Currently no drive reads all discs and no discs are compatible with all drives However newer drives perform significantly better than older drives The first phase of testing included 14 models of DVD ROM drives representing about 60 percent of the installed base in America as of last year Each drive was tested with more than 50 different brands and types of recordable DVD discs A second phase of testing will include new drives and media including those drives that allow consumers to record their own DVDs Computer scientists at NIST have developed specialized software and a comprehensive test plan which was published in October as NIST Special Publication 500 254 DVD ROM Drive Compatibility Test The results of the test will be made available to manufacturers to help them improve the compatibility of their products Media Contact mailto philip bulman nist gov Phil Bulman 301 975 5661 top Up

progress in the agency s ongoing federal technical investigation of the Feb 20 2003 fire at The Station nightclub in W Warwick R I The investigation team leaders also asked the people of Rhode Island to volunteer information to help the effort continue toward a successful outcome As our investigation moves into its next stages NIST needs individuals and groups to share with us any information that they have about The Station nightclub its operations and emergency procedures and the events in the building on the night of the fire said James E Hill acting director of NIST s Building and Fire Research Laboratory The investigation is being conducted under the authority of the National Construction Safety Team NCST Act Under the act NIST is authorized to investigate building failures The NIST investigations will establish the likely technical causes of the building failure and evaluate the technical aspects of emergency response and evacuation procedures in the wake of such failures The goal is to recommend improvements to the way in which buildings are designed constructed maintained and used in order to increase both occupant safety and structural integrity NIST announced at the press briefing that it has established a toll free anonymous phone line for persons with information to contact the Rhode Island investigation team at 877 451 8001 Individuals also can provide information by fax at 301 975 6122 by e mail at ncst nist gov or by regular mail at NCST Rhode Island Investigation NIST 100 Bureau Dr Stop 8660 Gaithersburg Md 20899 8660 For more details see http

new reference material from the National Institute of Standards and Technology NIST will help researchers determine what methods of irradiating the plastic parts in joint replacements during manufacturing will best increase their wear resistance Reference Material 8457 is intended to help address concerns about the long term durability of orthopedic hip implants amid growing use of these devices in younger more active patients It is well known that radiation can create new chemical bonds between adjacent molecular chains in a special form of polyethylene used to make the socket for the metal ball and shaft in an artificial hip This crosslinking creates a structure that resists sliding forces and wear Manufacturers and researchers need to control radiation conditions to achieve the intended wear resistance too much radiation causes brittleness and too little can result in poor wear resistance The NIST material consists of 10 small identical cubes of polyethylene The cubes are intended for use as control samples in a new ASTM International standard test method The method involves immersing cubes in an organic liquid and measuring how much the material swells Samples that expand the most have the least amount of crosslinking Each reference material comes with a certificate that provides precise cube dimensions and information about swelling from a series of round robin tests involving six laboratories The reference material will help researchers and implant manufacturers control or optimize a variety of processing parameters such as the type gamma radiation or electron beams timing and doses of radiation used for crosslinking Media Contact mailto laura ost nist gov Laura Ost 301 975 4034 top Up blue divider Testing Rescue Robots At Arenas Around the Globe Opportunities for major strides in robotic search and rescue technology should advance in December when Italy opens a year round robot testing arena in Rome The arena patterned after one created by the National Institute of Standards and Technology NIST simulates conditions in collapsed buildings The Rome facility duplicates arenas already fabricated in the United States and Japan Two more robot arenas based on the NIST design are scheduled to open next year in Germany and Portugal The arenas host RoboCupRescue an international robotic search and rescue team competition designed to advance robot rescue capabilities Researchers also use the arenas to perform robot experiments and support collaboration between organizations Like real collapsed buildings all the arenas include sections that range in difficulty from level uncluttered surfaces to areas that require stair climbing and navigation among pancaked floors and rubble The next RoboCupRescue event is scheduled for Lisbon in June 2004 Revised competition rules and improved ways to measure robot performance should increase the relevance of such events for real emergencies For example new limitations on robot human radio communications better reflect real disaster conditions in which frequencies are usually overloaded with emergency communications and structural debris often interferes with transmission Multiple sensor identifications of simulated victims also are now encouraged and false positive identifications that in real life would jeopardize rescuers are penalized To comply teams are adding sensors for body heat and other signs of life body movement sound moaning tapping and carbon dioxide breathing Sensors that can detect human urine and sweat as well as hazards such as gas leaks are also under development During these international competitions both NIST and National Science Foundation funded researchers videotape the robots and operator interfaces to identify best in class algorithms sensors and mechanisms They also gather information from robot operators to help in continuing to refine robot performance measures Media Contact mailto john blair nist gov John Blair 301 975 4261 top
