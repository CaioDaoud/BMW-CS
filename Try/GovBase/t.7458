message Follow the directions included with the form that is returned to you if supportEmptyParas endif 3 Why am I getting an error when I try to get my password and alias if supportEmptyParas endif The getpass function only works when the email message is sent to getpass nih gov from an email address of which the NIH Directory has knowledge In other words the message needs to be sent from either the address that is currently listed in the user s entry or from an account that is reported as being active by a system administrator Users may contact phadmin nih gov if they still can not access this information after following these instructions if supportEmptyParas endif 4 How do I change my alias I want my alias to be johndoe nih gov if supportEmptyParas endif A user s alias which is the user s initials followed by a number and then a letter is automatically generated by the NIH Directory database system when a user is added to the system and can not be changed If a user would like to use a nickname such as johndoe nih gov an entry can be added in the nickname field of the user s entry which will allow for this to work However nicknames must be used with caution as they are NOT guaranteed to be unique nor are they guaranteed to REMAIN unique nothing prevents two or more users from selecting the same nickname For more information see the NIH Directory User s Guide at http helix nih gov docs online email email html http helix nih gov docs online email email html if supportEmptyParas endif 5 My name is listed incorrectly or has changed due to marriage divorce etc in the Directory and I can t change it why not A user is allowed to change all fields in a listing except the name and lastname fields To have name information modified please send mail to phadmin nih gov if supportEmptyParas endif 6 My name is not in the NIH Directory can you please add it if supportEmptyParas endif Users appear in the NIH E mail Directory as a result of information provided on their behalf by LAN or system administrators If you are not in the Directory it is because either if supportEmptyParas endif your local e mail administrator is not participating in the Directory or your local e mail administrator is participating but hasn t sent us an update recently your account is a new one and hasn t been added to the Directory yet New accounts can take up to 3 4 days to appear in the Directory if supportEmptyParas endif Please ask your e mail administrator to contact us at phadmin nih gov if supportEmptyParas endif 7 I got an error message when I tried to update my listing why if supportEmptyParas endif If a user gets an error message while attempting to update his listing the most likely cause is that the database is currently locked for updating especially if the problem is occurring on a Tuesday or Friday morning If the problem persists please contact phadmin nih gov with a copy of the message being received if supportEmptyParas endif 8 How should I advertise my email address if supportEmptyParas endif The NIH Directory assigns an alias such as mailto gm13v nih gov gm13v nih gov when a user s name is initially entered into the system This alias is guaranteed to always remain unique and is the recommended method of advertising one s email address Mail sent to this address will be automatically forwarded to the email address listed in the NIH Directory if supportEmptyParas endif Users may advertise their e mail address as Firstname Last nih gov or any combination of your name and or selected nickname as long as that address is unique within the NIH Directory If the user s name or selected nickname is unique within the NIH Directory then mail sent to that address will be automatically forwarded to the e mail address listed in the NIH Directory However only the assigned alias is guaranteed to remain unique Neither nicknames nor a possible combination of first and last names such as mailto mark smith nih gov mark smith nih gov are guaranteed to be unique nor to remain unique and users should carefully consider the consequences of using this method to advertise their email address Entries in the NIH Directory change daily and a name or nickname combination that is unique one day may not be unique the next When that happens email will be returned to the sender as undeliverable if supportEmptyParas endif 9 I have been using a nickname or my name as my advertised email address and now it no longer works why Can I get that email address grandfathered in since I was using it first if supportEmptyParas endif The use of nicknames or a combination of your first and last names as your advertised email address is not guaranteed to be unique NOR to remain unique once you have started using either We advise users to use these with extreme caution when using either of these as a means of advertising their email addresses especially persons who might have a common name It is possible that either someone might decide to enter the same nickname in his NIH Directory entry or a new employee with the same name might start working at NIH that would result in a conflict and prevent email from being delivered as the uniqueness of the email address would be lost if supportEmptyParas endif There is no way for us to preserve or protect a selected email address once a user has advertised it for use Even though someone may have used an address for many years there is no way for us to ensure preserve or restore its uniqueness The ONLY guaranteed unique nih gov email address for each employee is the use of the assigned NIH Directory alias For this reason the recommended method of advertising one s email address is via the alias like mailto gm13v nih gov gm13v nih gov because it is guaranteed to be unique whereas mailto mark smith nih gov mark smith nih gov has no such guarantee if supportEmptyParas endif 10 What does verified by user mean if supportEmptyParas endif An entry is considered verified if the user has made changes to his her listing or acknowledged that the information currently listed is correct This indicator is VERY important for one reason if a user s entry is verified the information in the listing most importantly the email address will NOT be changed if a system administrator submits an update with a new email account for that user However if an entry is unverified any changes or new email account information submitted by a system administrator will overwrite whatever is currently listed Thus it is important that NIH personnel review and verify their listings to ensure the most up to date information is listed if supportEmptyParas endif 11 How often is the NIH Directory updated if supportEmptyParas endif The Helix Systems staff performs an update of the Directory twice a week normally early on Tuesday and Friday mornings During these times update files that have been submitted by system administrators are applied to the Directory database Changes made by users on an individual basis become effective immediately and are not processed as part of the database updates if supportEmptyParas endif 12 How can I find information about a specific employee Information regarding NIH personnel may be obtained from the Web site at http directory nih gov http directory nih gov by entering a name in the search box You may enter the first last or full name of an individual but please do not include punctuation marks nor titles as part of the search entry You may use a as a trailing wildcard on a name if you are not sure of the spelling if supportEmptyParas endif The NIH Directory Service does not contain complete information for every person who works at NIH It is possible that some employees may not be listed as some Institutes do not fully participate in the directory service The Directory only contains information about individuals For information regarding offices programs etc please contact the NIH Office of Communications at nihinfo nih gov if supportEmptyParas endif 13 How can I do a search of the Directory and get a listing of all employees in a specific Institute if supportEmptyParas endif The NIH Directory does not provide the capability to search on a specific Institute 14 Can you provide me with the phone number address or email address for John Doe since it is not given as part of his listing if supportEmptyParas endif Users and their institutes are responsible for the content of employee entries in the NIH Directory If part of a user s entry is incomplete we have no way of being able to provide additional information regarding that person if supportEmptyParas endif 15 Why is my information in the Exchange Global Access List GAL different than what is listed in the NIH Directory and can you please change it for me if supportEmptyParas endif Changes that are made in the NIH Directory with the exception of the user s email address are NOT reflected in the GAL However changes made to a user s listing in the GAL do get reflected in the

people are sending mail to the wrong address so I d like to get the wrong one deleted How do I do this if supportEmptyParas endif Microsoft Exchange users at NIH have entries added to the NIH E mail Directory The Directory in turn is imported into the Exchange Global Address List GAL on a daily basis if supportEmptyParas endif Users who have their Exchange SMTP address set as the forwarding address in their Directory entry will appear in the GAL once if supportEmptyParas endif Users who have a non Exchange email address set as the forwarding address in their NIH Directory entry will appear in the GAL twice One GAL entry will be the Exchange address the other will be the preferred NIH Directory address This is a feature of the NIH GAL The second entry in the GAL can be elimiated if users change the preferred email address in their NIH listings to match their Exchange email addresses Once this change is complete the second entry in the GAL will disappear with the next overnight update of the GAL if supportEmptyParas endif 17 I have two listings in the NIH Directory how do I delete a duplicate or incorrect entry if supportEmptyParas endif To get a duplicate entry deleted please send email to phadmin nih gov specifying the multiple entries and the alias of the entry that you wish to keep Multiple entries will be combined into a single entry and a listing added to the nickname field with the duplicate aliases so that any messages addressed to the deleted alias can still be successfully delivered if supportEmptyParas endif 18 Can you please delete my email

ALW please contact the CIT accounts at x43278 if supportEmptyParas endif 19 John Doe left NIH several years ago and still has a listing in the NIH Directory could you please delete it if supportEmptyParas endif Entries appear in the Directory based on the existence of one or more valid NIH e mail accounts Users are removed from the Directory when e mail accounts are no longer reported for that user Because of a series of checks and balances within the database software an entry for a user can not be deleted from the NIH Directory when active e mail accounts for that user are still being reported to the Directory Service if supportEmptyParas endif For assistance in deleting CIT e mail accounts including Helix Wylbur ALW and POP accounts please contact the CIT Help Desk at 301 594 3278 if supportEmptyParas endif 20 My listing in the DHHS Directory Dept of Health Human Services is incorrect could you please correct it or send DHHS an update if supportEmptyParas endif DHHS
