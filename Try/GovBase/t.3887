real time production resumed around 7am ET on Dec 8 5 December 2003 2003 339 The Rapid Response web site went down around 9pm ET because of hardware failure The system was back up around 6pm ET on Dec 6 21 November 2003 2003 325 Data from the Aqua satellite had a difference of up to approximately 2 1 2 km at nadir between geolocations calculated with the standard predicted ephemeris and that calculated with the definitive ephemeris http rapidfire sci gsfc nasa gov ephdiff 2003325 view plot This was probably caused by solar activity The affected data granules have been reprocessed with the definitive ephemeris 18 November 2003 2003 322 Our input data feed from NOAA was delayed by up to 3 hours but returned to normal about 8 am ET 17 November 2003 2003 321 Production was interrupted around 12pm ET because of hardware issues Near real time production resumed around 7pm ET 8 November 2003 2003 312 The near real time production was interrupted around 3 30am ET because of hardware failure Normal operations resumed around 11pm ET Production delays are expected for granules received during that time interval 5 November 2003 2003 309 The Aqua satellite performed a maneuver beginning at 15 00 GMT This caused a difference of up to approximately 7 km at nadir between geolocations calculated with the predicted ephemeris and that calculated with the definitive ephemeris http rapidfire sci gsfc nasa gov ephdiff 2003309 view plot The affected data granules have been reprocessed with the definitive ephemeris 4 November 2003 2003 308 Data from the Aqua satellite had a difference of up to approximately 1600 m at nadir between geolocations calculated with the standard predicted ephemeris and that calculated with the definitive ephemeris http rapidfire sci gsfc nasa gov ephdiff 2003308 view plot This was probably caused by solar activity The affected data granules have been reprocessed with the definitive ephemeris 1 November 2003 2003 305 Data from the Aqua satellite had a difference of up to approximately 2 1 2 km at nadir between geolocations calculated with the standard predicted ephemeris and that calculated with the definitive ephemeris http rapidfire sci gsfc nasa gov ephdiff 2003305 view plot This was probably caused by solar activity The affected data granules have been reprocessed with the definitive ephemeris 31 October 2003 2003 304 Data from the Aqua satellite had a difference of up to approximately 1250 m at nadir between geolocations calculated with the standard predicted ephemeris and that calculated with the definitive ephemeris http rapidfire sci gsfc nasa gov ephdiff 2003304 view plot This was probably caused by solar activity The affected data granules have been reprocessed with the definitive ephemeris 30 October 2003 2003 303 Data from the Aqua satellite had a difference of up to approximately 700 m at nadir between geolocations calculated with the standard predicted ephemeris and that calculated with the definitive ephemeris http rapidfire sci gsfc nasa gov ephdiff 2003303 view plot This was probably caused by solar activity The affected data granules have been reprocessed with the definitive ephemeris 7 October 2003 2003 280 The Aqua satellite performed an inclination maneuver beginning at 15 08 GMT This caused a difference of up to approximately 6 km at nadir between geolocations calculated with the predicted ephemeris and that calculated with the definitive ephemeris http rapidfire sci gsfc nasa gov ephdiff 2003280 view plot from that time up to the end of the day 5 October 2003 2003 278 Production was interrupted around 3am ET because of hardware failure 25 September 2003 2003 268 Production was interrupted around 11pm ET on 9 24 because of hardware failure Near real time production resumed around 12pm noon ET 18 September 2003 2003 261 Near real time production is suspended at 8pm ET in anticipation of power outages Due to network outages normal production is resumed on 9 20 at 12pm noon ET only 13 September 2003 2003 256 Aqua predicted ephemeris was not received for julian day 256 Morning data started being processed using the definitive ephemeris around 1pm ET 7 September 2003 2003 250 Our input data feed from NOAA is disrupted We observe data drop outs and a number of granules cannot be processed 4 September 2003 2003 247 The near real time production of Aqua data is suspended temporarily because of errors observed in the predicted ephemeris that first occurred on day 224 08 12 and now reaches 10km along track Therefore Aqua data are processed approximately 26 hrs after acquisition using the definitive ephemeris The ephemeris prediction was fixed on 9 5 by the Flight Dynamics group Near real time Aqua production resumed on 9 6 31 August 2003 2003 243 We started experiencing hardware troubles around 11 30pm ET Production resumed around 9pm ET on 09 01 at 10 capacity Normal production resumed around 9am ET on 09 02 29 August 2003 2003 241 Aqua predicted ephemeris was not received for julian day 241 Morning data started being processed using the definitive ephemeris around 1pm ET 28 August 2003 2003 240 Our automatic input data feed has been disrupted since around 4pm ET As a result we are experiencing delays in our production Resolved on 8 29 at 11am ET 23 August 2003 2003 235 The realtime calendar page was down from Sat 23 around 10pm ET to Sun 24 around 10am ET 22 August 2003 2003 234 The Aqua geolocation error causes by the ephemeris prediction error we experience since day 224 reaches 500m along track and begins to be noticeable The problem was resolved on 9 4 19 August 2003 2003 231 An unusually large number of missing packets is observed in the Aqua granules over the South Atlantic Anomaly 16 50 to 17 10 These same granules processed later at the DAAC are correct likely thanks to the Level 0 sorting process run at the DAAC and not in the Rapid response System 18 August 2003 2003 230 Emissive bands were not processed successfully in the afternoon data for latitudes ranging from approximately 30N to 55N As a result no fire detection was performed in the affected areas The problem seems to be specific to the IMAPP version of the level 1B code although the exact cause is unknown The level 1B product processed later at the DAAC is correct 15 August 2003 2003 227 We experienced errors on one of the disks on the Rapid Response web server today and near real time browse data from 2001 day 240 to 2002 day 299 are not available Update The affected disk has been taken offline and data will be made available again as it is recovered 13 August 2003 2003 225 Aqua predicted ephemeris is not yet available for today julian day 225 Resolved This Aqua data has been processed using definitive ephemeris 12 August 2003 2003 224 A computational error in the Aqua predicted ephemeris we receive from the Flight Dynamics group induces a geolocation error in the Aqua data that grows every day The problem was uncovered on 08 29 and the cause was determined on 9 3 We stopped using the predicted ephemeris on 9 4 until it was fixed on 9 6 day 249 Most Aqua granules from day 240 to 247 were reprocessed using the definitive ephemeris Logo Layout Table http www nasa gov NASA http esipfed org ESIP http www gofc org gofc GOFC http maps geog umd edu UMCP http www fs fed us eng rsac USFS faq
