Arboretum Deck the Halls with Hippeastrum An Amaryllis Extravaganza javascript gotoshow Rotating images of Amaryllis flowers Amaryllis known to botanists as Hippeastrum appear in garden centers grocery stores and mail order catalogs throughout the country this time of year Indoor gardeners have become accustomed to an abundance of amaryllis bulbs that are specially treated to flower for the holidays at a reasonable price The story of how amaryllis were developed for mass marketing is a fascinating journey through horticultural history Long before the http www ars usda gov Agricultural Research Service was founded in 1953 USDA researchers grew thousands of bulbs in search of a pure white amaryllis for the Easter market Before that plant explorers combed remote areas of South America for species of Hippeastrum and early hybridization of these species in the Victorian era gave us plants with the more familiar large colorful flowers we see today These were refined and technological advances soon led to the mass production of modern hybrids Deck the Halls with Hippeastrum will be opening on Saturday December 6 and will remain open through February 1 2004 Hundreds of bulbs representing more than fifty cultivars and species are being forced and will be on display in the Administration Building lobby Visitors may want to plan to visit the exhibit more than once since the bloom period is different for each type of amaryllis and the character of the exhibit will gradually change with time The exhibit will be closed on December 25 Visit the Arboretum this winter to see the dazzling array of colorful blooms and learn about the colorful history of one of our most common holiday plants Be sure to attend our other Hippeastrum programs listed on the Education events html

Bonsai A Bonsai with Texas Inspiration The inspiration for a bonsai is often as captivating as the bonsai itself Shinonome created by Marybel Balendonck is a prime example It is a forest planting that features the Catlin lacebark elm Ulmus parviflora Catlin The majority of the trees in this beautiful windswept forest planting were originally purchased in gallon cans around 1967 They were then relegated to a flower bed where they were occasionally root pruned for almost ten years In 1976 Balendonck planted them on a slab of Arizona field stone Although she currently resides in California Balendonck hails from Texas and the forests of the Texas gulf coast are the inspiration for this forest Live oaks are dominant trees in this part of the country where they are swept into interesting shapes by the Gulf winds Shinonome which means eastern cloud is undoubtedly one of the best windswept forests ever created In 1989 Mr Hiromoto Seki Consul General of Japan named Balendonck s masterpiece in an official ceremony It is truly a work of art and we are proud to display it in the North American Pavilion of the Gardens collections bonsai html National Bonsai and Penjing Museum

highlighted turf research Lawns turfgrass and grassy areas are everywhere in our environment Turfgrass is found around homes in parks rights of way roadsides stadiums and even on the tops of some high rise apartment buildings in major cities A new turfgrass research program was established at the arboretum last year This research may lead to the development of new strains of turfgrass that are more pest and disease resistant This in turn may reduce the need for pesticides fertilizer and watering to maintain lawns In addition a turfgrass demonstration area is planned on the grounds of the Arboretum s Washington D C campus Click here for a look at a few turf research images Turfgrass is a major component of our landscape and many people have questions about how best to select and care for grass For example what is the best species of grass to grow How often should I fertilize my lawn How short can I mow my lawn How often should I water my lawn Gardens faqs turfgrassfaq1 html Click
