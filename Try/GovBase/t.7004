McCullough and Art Robinson Contact HYHolman lbl gov Hexavalent chromium Cr6 is a widespread contaminant that enters the environment through various industrial processes Cr6 compounds are highly water soluble toxic in the environment and carcinogenic in mammals However recent studies have shown that certain bacterial species on surfaces of geologic materials can detoxify the compounds by reducing them to relatively insoluble and hence significantly less harmful trivalent chromium Cr3 compounds a process known as biogeochemical transformation Berkeley Lab scientists have used the Fourier transform infrared FTIR spectromicroscopy beamline Beamline 1 4 3 at the ALS to obtain spatially resolved time dependent spectra that give evidence of the biogeochemical transformation of Cr6 This is the first time that biogeochemical transformation of Cr6 on a mineral surface has been nondestructively monitored and studied Because infrared light does not kill bacteria the transformation of Cr6 can be monitored as it occurs Distinct and relevant infrared absorption bands related to the transformation are used not only as chemical markers to detect different chromium species but also as biological markers to detect the presence and activity of microorganisms on specimen surfaces In addition the brightness of the infrared radiation from the beamline makes spatially resolved spectroscopy spectromicroscopy possible Two reduction mechanisms had previously been postulated for the reduction of Cr6 compounds The biological mechanism requires the presence of microorganisms to aerobically reduce the Cr6 The chemical mechanism relies on metal oxides such as Fe II compounds to catalyze the Cr6 reduction reaction The researchers conducted FTIR experiments to distinguish the relative significance of these two mechanisms In addition they evaluated the effects of common organic co contaminants such as toluene vapor on the biotic reduction process For magnetite surfaces containing no living microorganisms a five day exposure to Cr6 compounds resulted in no statistically significant changes in infrared chemical and biological markers indicating that no catalysis of Cr6 reduction was occurring On samples with living microorganisms however some Cr6 reduction was detected Moreover when the samples with living microorganisms were incubated in dilute toluene vapor statistically significant changes in both infrared absorption intensity and characteristic band shapes were observed for Cr6 as were new bands signaling the possible existence of intermediate Cr5 With FTIR spectromicroscopy the researchers showed that the changes in the infrared absorption bands occurred at the sites of bacterial concentration Imaging the surface at characteristic absorption bands showed a strong correlation between peak depletion of Cr6 and toluene and peak concentration of biological molecules In a study to determine if this microbial reduction process could occur in real geologic samples composite mineral surfaces of basalt rock chips containing resident communities of microbes were exposed to solutions of Cr6 and toluene vapor At the end of four months FTIR spectromicroscopy showed that Cr6 tolerant and Cr6 reducing natural microorganisms were thriving in association with Cr3 the results can be viewed on the Web at http www als lbl gov als science sci archive bioremed html http www als lbl gov als science sci archive bioremed html The reduced Cr3 state was confirmed by x ray absorption fine structure XAFS spectroscopy at Beamline 10 3 2 The nondestructive infrared spectromicroscopy studies combined with XAFS spectroscopy and microbiological techniques show that highly mobile and toxic Cr6 contaminants can be biologically reduced into less soluble less toxic Cr3 compounds The FTIR method can now be expanded to examine other infrared amenable microbial chemical contaminant systems Research conducted by H Y N Holman D L Perry G M

physical sciences independent investigator beamtime for the running period between October 1999 and May 2000 is complete The number of proposals was 160 slightly up from the previous period despite consolidation of the proposals by the scientists The number of requests for eight hour shifts increased by about 200 However only 1 681 shifts equal to 69 of the total time requested in the proposals were available It is regrettable that the ALS will be unable to grant beamtime to many excellent proposals Competition for time on insertion device beamlines was especially keen for these beamlines the ALS was able to grant only about 55 of the time requested Those requesting time on the insertion device beamlines will continue to find the proposal process for independent investigators extremely competitive Beamtime requests for independent investigator experiments are reviewed twice each year A Program Study Panel PSP evaluates each proposal providing the basis for granting beamtime The PSP is made up of five scientists from a variety of synchrotron science disciplines There is a separate PSP for the macromolecular crystallography facility at Beamline 5 0 More information on the PSP and independent investigator process is available on the ALS Web site at http www als lbl gov als quickguide independinvest html http www als lbl gov als quickguide independinvest html Total shifts

XAS gathered at the ALS on July 30 for an all day workshop Al Thompson of Berkeley Lab s Center for X Ray Optics CXRO and organizer of the event said the workshop had three goals to help develop a strong user community to get user comments on beamline upgrade plans and to explore new management options for the beamlines Originally built by CXRO for the development of x ray optics the beamlines have broadened considerably in scope as reflected in the brief talks given at the workshop by a number of the beamlines users Topics ranged from the study of metal impurities in silicon to the time resolved measurement of aerosols in the atmosphere and from the detection of trace elements in cancerous lung tissue to the possibility of analyzing future soil samples from Mars for signs of life Representatives of similar beamlines at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility ESRF the Advanced Photon Source APS and Louisiana State University s Center for Advanced Microstructures and Devices CAMD also gave presentations about the work being done at their facilities At the end of the day the group was invited to voice their opinions on how best to make the transition from a CXRO managed facility to one managed by a participating research team PRT of core users Members of a PRT are guaranteed a certain percentage of beamtime in exchange for providing the resources required to operate a beamline The majority of users preferred to have a single PRT for both beamlines and a list of interested PRT members was endorsed Those prospective members will meet soon to begin working out the details of forming a PRT Users who are interested in being a part of a 10 3 PRT but could not attend the workshop should contact Al Thompson ACThompson lbl gov 510 486 5590 5 UEC CORNER by Stephen Kevan Contact kevan oregon uoregon edu Much of this brief message will concern the UEC s recent planning activities for this year s Users Meeting scheduled for October 18 20 1999 The meeting will combine sessions on various specific subjects magnetic materials and films environmental materials chemical dynamics AMO physics and biological systems with other more broadly focused sessions that will include ALS highlights and talks by students and postdocs working at the ALS The majority of the talks in the focused sessions will be invited though a few will be added from submitted abstracts All talks in the highlight sessions will be selected from submitted abstracts As noted in the call for abstracts above the abstract deadline is August 20 1999 The final day of the meeting will be reserved for focused workshops A few subjects for these workshops have been designated but more can easily be added if interest exists Finally I want to inform you that ALS Director Daniel Chemla will be giving a talk at a meeting of the Basic Energy Sciences Advisory Committee BESAC scheduled for the second week of August He will primarily provide a status report on changes at the ALS in the wake of the Birgeneau Panel report The UEC views this as a very important opportunity to communicate with this influential committee The UEC was asked to have some members attend the meeting to provide informally the user perspective Nora Berrah and Paul Alivisatos will attend at least part of the meeting for this reason They also will attend a separate meeting that will include Chemla DOE program managers and the head of BESAC This meeting will focus in part on the issue of when or if the BESAC should schedule a follow up review of the ALS These meetings provide an unusual channel for communicating user opinions to the DOE and to one of its high level advisory committees As always I invite you to communicate with me or with any other member of the UEC to convey your opinions in this regard 6 WHO S IN TOWN A SAMPLING OF ALS USERS To highlight the richness of our user community and help introduce recent arrivals we offer this listing of some of the experimenters who will be
