United States and the world We support our government s role in leading the revitalization of the nation s nuclear power industry and re establishing U S world leadership in nuclear science and technology When sponsorship of the INEEL was formally transferred to the http www nuclear gov DOE Office of Nuclear Energy Science and Technology by Secretary Spencer Abraham in a July 2002 http energy gov engine content do PUBLIC ID 13402 BT CODE PR SPEECHES TT CODE PRESSRELEASE speech specific roles and responsibilities were assigned to Idaho s national laboratory in the areas of Generation IV nuclear power systems advanced fuel cycles and enabling technologies systems and practices These new assignments came in part as acknowledgement of the INEEL s unique status as the DOE site that designed and constructed 52reactors shtml 52 reactors since its establishment in 1949 as the National Reactor Testing Station For many years it was the site of the largest concentration of nuclear reactors in the world Notable among these Idaho reactors were Experimental Breeder Reactor I the first reactor to generate usable electricity from nuclear power the U S Navy s first prototype nuclear propulsion plant and the world s most capable test reactor the Advanced Test Reactor contributions shtml more The INEEL has the history infrastructure expertise and commitment to collaborate broadly characteristics required to fulfill our assigned role as the nation s center for nuclear energy research and development We also have the expertise infrastructure and strategic partnerships necessary
