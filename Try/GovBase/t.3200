activities are described below Beyond the Standard Model The key feature of the Standard Model of Particle Physics is electroweak symmetry breaking and the consequent origin of quark and lepton masses The Standard Model relies on an elementary scalar field the Higgs to provide for electroweak symmetry breaking but because of the extreme fine tuning involved most theorists believe that Nature has chosen a more elegant method Several alternatives have been proposed Supersymmetry extra dimensions and technicolor Over the next few years we should know the real answer due either to the upgraded Tevatron experiment which has started up at Fermilab or the LHC which is scheduled for 2007 at CERN Most of the current activity in this part of our group is in extra dimensions We are studying the Randall Sundrum model and it s generalizations as well as deconstructed models of extra dimensions We also work on particle cosmology and have recently proposed an alternative explanation of the recent supernova data that involves people terning axion html axion oscillations rather than an accelerating Universe http www lanl gov cgi bin fonelink pl 168881 J Erlich http www lanl gov cgi bin

heavy heavy quarks study the spectroscopy of glueballs and exotic hadrons provide estimates of up down strange charm and bottom quark masses calculate the strong coupling constant calculate the decay constants for light and heavy light mesons calculate the form factors for the semi leptonic decays of B and D meson calculate the form factor for the radiative decay of B to K gamma calculate the matrix elements of the four fermion operators needed to study CP violation investigate the properties of QCD at finite temperature and develop better algorithms and improve the lattice methodology This project is supported in part by a DOE Grand Challenge award people tanmoy tanmoy html T Bhattacharya people rajan R Gupta Lattice QCD More info Scaling in Biology Life manifests its extraordinary diversity from microbes to whales over a remarkable 21 orders of magnitude in size Surprisingly simple scaling laws have been found to hold over this entire spectrum For example metabolic rate lifespan and rate of growth vary as a power of the size of an organism the exponents are simple multiples of 1 4 T 8 member G B West made a breakthrough in our understanding of such phenomena life at every scale driven by natural selection is sustained by hierarchical fractal like branching networks whose universal characteristics determine many of the generic properties of living organisms http

disposal of plutonium energy production and production of tritium Next generation spallation neutron sources based on similar technology will play a major role in materials science and biological research Additionally other types of accelerators such as linear colliders e g the Next Linear Collider NLC and linac driven coherent light sources will have a significant impact on basic and applied scientific research All these projects require high resolution modeling far beyond that which has ever been performed by the accelerator community to reduce cost and technological risk and to improve accelerator efficiency performance and reliability Advanced modeling of accelerators is a collaborative project with LANSCE Division Robert Ryne LANSCE 1 and is supported in part by a DOE Grand Challenge award people salman S Habib people salman capgca More info Cosmology Work on the problem of the formation of large scale structure in the universe and the associated problems of dark matter

Jungman Nonequilibrium Field Theory Traditional applications of quantum field theory are restricted mainly to scattering processes and systems in thermal equilibrium Nonequilibrium quantum field theory is necessary to understand initial value problems such as arise in the dynamics of the early universe heavy ion collisions and the dynamics of phase transitions in general Recent advances made by the Los Alamos group include the successful implementation of the 1 N approximation in nonequilibrium theory including the solution of the renormalization problem in this situation understanding of effective dissipation in mean field theory and application of the new methods to disoriented chiral condensates and to the dynamics of second order phase transitions people cooper F Cooper people salman S Habib people emil E Mottola people salman newg More info Conformal Gravity people emil E Mottola Quantum Mechanics We are working on understanding the emergence of classical properties of a quantum system Basically the problem is that some of the classical properties are defined in terms of the trajectories of the system Thus for example the Lyapunov exponents of a system are defined as the rate of divergence of the nearby trajectories in the long time limit The presence of well defined trajectories is however a classical property the corresponding quantum system delocalizes under time evolution We show how even in systems which are not otherwise interacting with their environment the very process of continuous observation manages to localize the system continuously and we find trajectories emerging in the measurement record people tanmoy tanmoy html T Bhattacharya people salman S Habib http www lanl gov cgi bin fonelink pl 079910 M M Nieto Nonlinear Coherent Structures
