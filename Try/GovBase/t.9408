Facilities Siting Division Siting Division Org Chart Prior to 1975 industrial users and utilities were required to go through a multi year process to obtain permits from numerous federal state and local agencies before constructing new power facilities The Legislature revised this process in 1975 and established a comprehensive siting process for new energy facilities at the California Energy Commission The Legislature gave the Commission the statutory authority to license thermal power plants of 50 megawatts or greater and related transmission lines fuel supply lines and related facilities The purpose of the Systems Assessment and Facilities Siting Division is to ensure that needed energy facilities are authorized according to this process in an expeditious safe and environmentally acceptable manner In addition the division prepares all environmental documentation for the Commission as required by the California Environmental Quality Act CEQA To attain its objectives the division maintains a staff of experts in more than 20 environmental and engineering disciplines The division s range of technical expertise allows it to perform balanced totally independent evaluations of complex and controversial projects With a reorganization of the Energy Commission in 2001 the Electricity Office which formally was part of the old Energy Information and Analysis Division was moved to the Systems Assessment and Facilities Siting Division The division is organized into five offices and one unit Electricity Office Engineering Office Environmental Office
