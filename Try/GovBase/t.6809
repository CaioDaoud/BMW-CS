of AIDS Acquired immune deficiency syndrome AIDS is the result of an infection with the human immunodeficiency virus HIV This virus attacks selected cells of the immune nervous and other systems and impairs their proper function HIV infection may cause damage to the brain and spinal cord via encephalitis inflammation of the brain and meningitis inflammation of the membranes surrounding the brain It can also cause nerve damage difficulties in thinking i e AIDS dementia complex behavioral changes poor circulation headache and stroke AIDS related cancers such as lymphoma and opportunistic infections OI may also affect the nervous system Neurological symptoms may be mild in the early stages of AIDS but can become severe in the final stages Complications vary widely from one patient to another Cerebral toxoplasmosis a common OI in AIDS patients causes such symptoms as headache confusion lethargy and low grade fever Other symptoms may include weakness speech disturbance ataxia apraxia seizures and sensory loss Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy PML a disorder that can also occur in AIDS patients causes weakness hemiparesis or facial weakness dysphasia vision loss and ataxia Some patients with PML may also develop compromised memory and cognition Is there any treatment There is no cure for AIDS but recently developed treatments help to slow the progression of the disease Some neurological symptoms and complications may improve with treatment For example antidementia drugs may relieve confusion and slow mental decline Infections can be treated with antibiotics Radiation therapy may be needed to treat AIDS related cancers present in the brain or spinal cord What is the prognosis The overall prognosis for individuals with AIDS in recent years has improved significantly because of new drugs and treatments AIDS clinicians often fail to recognize neurological complications of AIDS Those who suspect they are having neurological complications should be sure to discuss these with their doctor What research is being done The NINDS supports a broad spectrum of basic and clinical research studies on the neurological complications of AIDS Much of this research is conducted at leading biomedical research institutions across the country http clinicaltrials gov search term Neurological Complications of AIDS Select this link to view a list of
