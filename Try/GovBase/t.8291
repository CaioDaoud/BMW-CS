pm Town Hall Meeting The Climate Change Science Program A town hall meeting held in conjunction with the http www agu org meetings fm03 index shtml American Geophysical Union AGU Fall Meeting will focus on the Climate Change Science Program CCSP The Climate Change Science Program integrates research on global change and climate change sponsored by 13 participating federal government departments and agencies CCSP coordinates approximately 1 7 billion in research annually In July 2003 the program completed a strategic science plan for the coming decade The plan articulates a new vision and mission for climate and global change research that focuses on five overarching goals and related science objectives and deliverables in seven research elements This town hall meeting will focus on the integration of research activities across the various federal agencies to address these goals and produce approximately 20 CCSP synthesis and assessment products over the next four years Representatives of the CCSP and participating federal agencies will provide an overview of the new program and discuss implementation Emphasis will be on dialogue regarding opportunities and challenges For more information please contact Dr Richard H Moss Climate Change Science Program Office 1717 Pennsylvania Avenue NW Suite 250 Washington DC 20006 Tel 1 202 419 3476 Fax 1 202 223 3908 E
