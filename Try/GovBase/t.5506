First Cooperating Technical State A dramatization of construction of a bridge across a waterway without using geodesy A dramatization of construction of a bridge across a waterway without using geodesy Geodesy is the branch of mathematics that deals with the shape and area of the Earth Without a good foundation a building will collapse Our transportation infrastructure is the same way The location and placement of roads must be predetermined so that traffic runs smoothly When building a road or bridge over water construction teams have to make sure that the two sections of the bridge will meet at the same point If they don t the bridge will be unusable National Spatial Reference System An example of the kind of mark NGS sets An example of the kind of mark NGS sets http www ngs noaa gov NOAA s National Geodetic Survey NGS provides the foundation needed for these kinds of projects NGS and its predecessor agencies have set permanent survey marks throughout the United States Each survey mark has an exact horizontal and vertical position defined by latitude longitude and height coordinates in relation to the surface and shape of the Earth NGS connects these marks together in a network called the http www ngs noaa gov INFO OnePagers One Pager NSRS pdf National Spatial Reference System NSRS This network is the federal standard and foundation for all positioning and navigation activities NGS is exploring how to use more efficient methods to measure the vertical points in the NSRS By knowing elevations or heights it is possible to measure how fast land is sinking or the vertical distance between a ship s bottom and the channel floor http www ngs noaa gov initiatives height modernization shtml Height Modernization is a program within NGS that provides accurate height information needed to develop and expand the vertical portion of the NSRS top top Traditional surveying Traditional surveying Global Positioning System Until very recently NGS relied on traditional line of sight survey measurements to position permanent marks This process which requires field crews to measure distances between marks was time consuming and expensive However with the advent of the Global Positioning System GPS in the 1980s these methods drastically changed By using GPS the Height Modernization Program can accurately and quickly collect data on elevation Setting up GPS equipment Setting up GPS equipment The use of GPS has progressed in two stages Initially GPS was much more accurate in determining horizontal coordinates than vertical heights due to a number of technical factors For the past several years however the National Geodetic Survey in cooperation with the GPS community has developed standards specifications and techniques that enable GPS to attain the accuracy levels required for most applications using height information These height modernization techniques are not yet commonly known or practiced by the private sector surveying community because to introduce them on a widespread basis requires a major technology transfer effort In addition the existing geodetic reference framework that supports height measurements must be updated to efficiently support the use of GPS to determine accurate height measurements without additional advancements top top populated harbor Height modernization is needed to help ships navigate under bridges Photo credit 111th Aerial Photography Squadron 2002 Height Modernization Studies In 1998 the U S Congress directed NGS to conduct a National http oceanservice noaa gov cgi bin redirout cgi url http www acsm net heightmod pdf Height Modernization Study U S Dept of Commerce 1998 to determine the effectiveness of height modernization in two states California and North Carolina and its potential benefits to the nation In 2001 Congress requested additional information from NGS regarding the specific needs and uses for improved height data in two additional states Wisconsin and Louisiana http www ngs noaa gov PUBS LIB NGSreport 823 pdf U S Department of Commerce 2001 These studies found that accurate heights determined through height modernization will allow aircraft to land safely in low visibility conditions alert safety planners to evacuation routes that are slowly sinking and susceptible to flooding provide ships with safer under keel and overhead clearance to avoid dangerous collisions identify flood prone areas to guide new construction and reconstruction projects in vulnerable areas allow efficient fertilizer and pesticide use and reduce costs to counter pollution from chemical runoff improve the efficiency and reliability of water delivery systems top top State Partnerships CORS map of California This map of continuously operating reference stations CORS shows a network of permanently operating GPS receivers in California CORS are able to constantly monitor elevation changes Since the 1998 and 2001 height modernization studies NGS has continued to work with states in pilot efforts to develop and test more effective ways to improve elevation data Today height modernization is being developed in California Louisiana Mississippi North Carolina South Carolina and Wisconsin NGS works with primary agencies within each state to develop the programs e g the Wisconsin Department of Transportation Eventually NGS hopes to transfer complete responsibility to state organizations California was one of the first states to benefit from the Height Modernization Program Because California is extremely susceptible to earthquakes local officials wanted a system in place that would continually monitor the motion of the Earth s crust The http oceanservice noaa gov cgi bin redirout cgi url http csrc ucsd edu California Spatial Reference Center CSRC has developed a reference network that includes a mix of traditional geodetic marks and http www ngs noaa gov CORS continuously operating reference stations CORS The CORS sites are permanently operating GPS receivers and thus are able to constantly monitor elevation changes By using the elevation data gathered from CORS state officials can watch how the land moves These sites are also used in other projects such as measuring the rise of sea levels and ensuring that ships have safe under keel and overhead clearance top top North Carolina First Cooperating Technical State Flooding housing

launched a major effort to update vertical positions with height modernization On September 15 1999 Hurricane Floyd dropped 21 inches of rain on North Carolina damaging more than 67 000 homes and destroying nearly 8 000 Many of the homeowners did not have flood insurance because their residences were built on land that had not been designated as flood prone on the http oceanservice noaa gov

improve the accuracy of the floodplain maps With North Carolina s vulnerability to hurricanes and flooding communities and property owners need to have accurate up to date information about flood risks So far the use of height modernization in states like North Carolina and California has proven the program s cost effectiveness and accuracy Using GPS versus traditional surveying can result in savings from 25 to 90 percent depending on the type of survey conducted Even though overall cost savings are lower data reliability and quality assurance are higher Through collaboration between NGS and other federal state local and private partners height modernization measures more accurate heights on land in the sea and in the air top top search button For More Information http www ngs noaa
