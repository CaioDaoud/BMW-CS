Rainfall in San Joaquin Valley The toxic pesticides diazinon and chlorpyrifos were found in all rainfall samples collected by the U S Geological Survey USGS in the area of Modesto Calif during January and February 2001 storms The concentrations of these two insecticides in the rainfall samples exceeded proposed state guidelines for the protection of aquatic life in most samples by up to a factor of 10 for diazinon and up to a factor of 7 4 for chlorpyrifos Many pesticides become airborne during the application process and can drift off site said Michael Majewski a USGS scientist and expert in atmospheric deposition who contributed to the study After they are applied many pesticides volatilize into the lower atmosphere a process that can continue for days weeks or months after the application depending on the compound In addition pesticides can become airborne attached to wind blown dust Rainfall samples collected during the dormant spray season in Modesto and the surrounding agricultural areas exceeded the state guidelines for diazinon concentrations by an average factor of 5 7 for diazinon and 3 1 for chlorpyrifos Simultaneously storm runoff samples were collected from an urban storm drain where diazinon concentration exceeded the proposed state aquatic life guidelines by an average factor of 9 5 Sixty eight percent of the diazinon concentration found in the storm drain runoff could be accounted for by the concentration in the rainfall Additionally samples were collected from the San Joaquin Merced Stanislaus and Tuolumne rivers and Orestimba Creek during this study Sixty out of a total of 240 of these samples exceeded the proposed state guideline for diazinon and 18 for chlorpyrifos The highest concentrations of diazinon occurred in the San Joaquin River where concentrations exceeded the state guidelines by as much as 3 6 times The highest chlorpyrifos concentrations occurred at Orestimba Creek where samples exceeded the state guidelines by a factor of 3 4 It is important to recognize that the application of these pesticides affect all parts of the hydrologic cycle said the report s lead author USGS scientist Celia Zamora It is during rainfall events that these pesticides get washed out of the atmosphere and produce run off at surprisingly high levels that exceed the guidelines for protection of aquatic life The study will continue through 2004 at six sites in the San Joaquin River Basin and two additional sites in the Sacramento River Basin The complete results of the study will be forthcoming This study was funded by the California Department of Pesticide Regulation to provide additional information to the Central Valley Regional Water Quality Control Board for their development of Total Maximum Daily Load regulation for diazinon and chlorpyrifos in the San Joaquin Basin The USGS report entitled Diazinon and Chlorpyrifos Loads in Precipitation and Urban and Agricultural Storm Runoff during January and February 2001 in

Oakland 20 000 Year Old Water Found Under Oakland Potential Oakland Area Emergency Water Supply Would Be Stored in Ancient Well Isolated Aquifer According to scientists at the U S Geological Survey USGS water in some areas beneath the East Bay Plain near Oakland Calif is almost 20 000 years old The underground aquifer and the ancient water it contains was explored by the USGS in cooperation with East Bay Municipal Utility District EBMUD to help find a place to store an emergency source of water for use in the event of a drought or large scale natural disaster like a fire or earthquake EBMUD proposes to inject water into the lower aquifer system store it and later recover it without undesirable changes in quality USGS scientists were asked to determine if the lower aquifer was isolated from surface sources of ground water contamination and from contamination in the overlying aquifer While the aging casings of abandoned wells could potentially create an unwanted connection examination of the existing water supplies determined that the aquifer remains quite isolated http water usgs gov pubs wri wri024286 The Pulse of Environmental Selenium The Pulse of Environmental Selenium How does a toxic substance like selenium find its way from the Coast Ranges of California into the San Joaquin Valley In pulses scientists have learned More than 10 inches of rain inundated the Coast Ranges and Panoche Creek in central California during February 1998 storms carrying with it about two million tons of sediment and over two tons of selenium according to a report released today by the U S Geological Survey USGS The Panoche Creek alluvial fan area is a major source of the trace element selenium that contributed to the well publicized waterfowl deformities and deaths at Kesterson National Wildlife Refuge in the 1980s Today that selenium is able to make its way into the San Joaquin River and eventually into the San Francisco Bay Delta http water usgs gov pubs wri

septic systems artificial recharge and nitrate contamination in Yucca Valley California The USGS completed the study in partnership with Hi Desert Water District HDWD and the Mojave Water Agency We used extensive water quality analysis including analysis for caffeine and selected human pharmaceutical products to identify the source of nitrate contamination said USGS scientist Tracy Nishikawa High nitrates were found in an area located between land surface and the water table called the unsaturated zone The nitrates were transported to the ground water via rising water levels from the artificial recharge program http water usgs gov pubs wri wri034062 Underground water storage may alter ground water quality Underground water storage may alter ground water quality The USGS study of a test site in the Antelope Valley of southern California near Lancaster found that when treated surface water was used to recharge the aquifer by products of the water disinfection process accumulated
