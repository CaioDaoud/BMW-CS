Eligible to Become Principal Investigators o Where to Send Inquiries o Submitting an Application o Supplementary Instructions o Peer Review Process o Review Criteria o Award Criteria o Required Federal Citations PURPOSE The purpose of this Program Announcement PAR is to continue the competitive National Center for Research Resources NCRR Shared Instrumentation Grant SIG Program initiated in Fiscal Year 1982 Results of the most recent study The National Survey of Academic Research Instruments and Instrumentation published in 1997 identified bioanalytical equipment of the type provided through this Program as the top most priority The objective of the program is to make available to institutions expensive research instruments that can only be justified on a shared use basis and for which meritorious research projects are described The SIG Program provides a cost effective mechanism for groups of NIH supported investigators to obtain commercially available technologically sophisticated equipment costing more than 100 000 RESEARCH OBJECTIVES This program is designed to provide for the acquisition or updating of expensive shared use instrumentation not generally available through other NIH mechanisms such as the regular research project program project or center grant programs Proposals for research on advancing the design or for the development of new instrumentation will not be considered Types of instrumentation supported include but are not limited to nuclear magnetic resonance systems electron and confocal microscopes mass spectrometers protein and DNA sequencers biosensors x ray diffractometers and cell sorters Support will not be provided for general purpose equipment or purely instructional equipment personal computers personal workstations printers and Ethernet interfaces Proposals for stand alone computer systems will only be considered if the instrument is solely dedicated to the research needs of a broad community of NIH supported investigators For purpose of eligibility a major user group of three or more investigators must be identified A minimum of three major users must be Principal Investigators on NIH peer reviewed research grants at the time of the application and award For purposes of this program research grants are defined as those grants awarded with the following activity codes P01 R01 U01 R35 and R37 The application should also show a clear need for the instrumentation by projects supported by multiple NIH peer review research grants including but not limited to those listed above and demonstrate that these projects will require at least 75 percent of the total usage of the instrument Major users can be individual researchers or a group of investigators within the same department or from several departments at the applicant institution NIH extramural awardees from other nearby institutions may also be included If the major user group does not require total usage of the instrument access to the instrument should be made available to other users upon the advice of the internal advisory committee see below These users need not be NIH awardees but priority should be given to NIH supported scientists engaged in biomedical behavioral research To promote cost effectiveness to encourage optimal sharing among individual investigators research groups and departments and to foster a collaborative multidisciplinary environment the instrument should be integrated into a central core facility whenever possible Each applicant institution must propose a Principal Investigator who can assume administrative scientific oversight responsibility for the instrumentation requested This person need not be an NIH grantee An internal advisory committee must be named to assist the Principal Investigator in administering the grant and overseeing the responsibility for the instrument The membership of this committee should be broadly based and include members without a conflict of interest who can resolve disputes if they arise The Principal Investigator and the advisory committee are responsible for the development of guidelines for o Maximum utilization of the instrument including time allocation o A detailed plan for the day to day management of the instrument o A financial plan for the long term operation and maintenance of the instrument during the post award period During the post award period the Principal Investigator will also be responsible for obtaining appropriate no cost extensions of the project period if needed Ninety days following the end of the project period a final progress report is required that describes the instrument purchased and a list of all users and description of the value of the instrument to the investigators and to the institution as a whole The Principal Investigator and the advisory committee are also responsible for the relocation of the instrument within the institution if the major user group is significantly altered MECHANISM OF SUPPORT This PAR will use the SIG mechanism S10 SIG provides support for expensive state of the art instrumentation utilized in both basic and clinical research Applications are limited to instruments that cost at least 100 000 per instrument or integrated instrument system The maximum award is 500 000 Since the nature and scope of the instruments that may be requested will vary it is anticipated that the size of an award will vary also Awards will be made for the direct costs only The institution must meet those costs not covered in the normal purchase price required to place the instrumentation in operational order as well as the maintenance support personnel and service costs associated with maximum utilization of the instrument There is no upper limit on the cost of the instrument but the maximum award is 500 000 Grants will be awarded for a period of one year and are not renewable Supplemental applications will not be accepted The program does not provide facilities and administrative F A costs or support for construction or alterations and renovations Cost sharing is not required If the amount of funds requested does not cover the total cost of the instrument the application should describe the proposed source s of funding for the balance of the cost of the instrument Documentation of the availability of the remainder of funding signed by an appropriate institutional official must be presented to NCRR prior to issuance of award Applicants proposing purchase of an instrument that the institution is planning to lease prior to award are urged to consult with their institutional sponsored projects office regarding applicable NIH policy prior to executing the leasing agreement If the leasing agreement was executed more than one year prior to submission of the SIG application the applicant must provide strong justification for the requested Federal funds Further the instrument must be considered state of the art at the time of submission of the SIG application Award adjustments may be necessary Execution of a purchase order or agreement making a down payment or other formal commitment to purchase the equipment prior to award must be in compliance with NIH policy regarding pre award cost authority see NIH Grants Policy Statement Rev 3 01 Allowability of Costs Activities Preaward Preagreement Costs page 96 Non compliance with this policy automatically eliminates an applicant from eligibility for an award ELIGIBLE INSTITUTIONS You may submit an application if your institution has any of the following characteristics o Non profit organizations o Public or private institutions such as universities colleges and hospitals o Domestic institutions organization Under the general research support authority of Section 301 a 3 of the Public Health Service Act Shared Instrumentation Grant awards are made to public and non profit domestic institutions only These institutions include health professional schools other academic institutions hospitals health departments and research organizations Note that Federal institutions foreign institutions and for profit institutions are not eligible to apply A Federal institution is defined by the NIH as a Cabinet level department or independent agency of the executive branch of the Federal Government or any component organization of such a department or agency To be eligible to apply three or more NIH funded investigators Principal Investigators of active P01 R01 U01 R35 or R37 research grants who will be users of the requested instrument must be identified Applications will be accepted that request a single commercially available instrument or integrated instrument system which costs at least 100 000 There is no restriction on the number of applications an institution can submit to the SIG program each year provided the applications request different types of equipment However if two or more applications are submitted for similar equipment for example two 600 MHz NMR spectrometers from the same institution documentation from a high level institutional official must be provided stating that this is not an unintended duplication but part of a campus wide institutional plan An application requesting more than one type of instrumentation for example a mass spectrometer and a confocal microscope will not be considered responsive to this PAR and will be returned INDIVIDUALS ELIGIBLE TO BECOME PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATORS Any individual with the skills knowledge and resources necessary to carry out the proposed
