Safety page The new Research Library home page was created as a response to user feedback Our goal was to create a usable site with easy navigations that takes into account our user wants and needs A special thanks to the users for their time and comments Katherine Norskog for the idea of displaying 4 images in a row and the Research Library staff for their insightful comments throughout the redesign process Various webpages influenced the design of our home page The idea to put the My Library login and the number of journals articles and citations on the page came from http highwire
