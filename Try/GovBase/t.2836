for Structures and Materials the Langley Research Center develops and tests new materials and structural designs that make airplanes and spacecraft stronger safer and more efficient Lighter Stronger Safer Better Imagine an airplane wing built entirely out of carbon fiber and stitched together by a huge sewing machine Not only is this wing lighter and stronger than conventional wings but no mechanical fasteners are used in its production That eliminates almost 80 000 rivets Although still in the testing phase at Langley this exceptionally lightweight material could last longer and save on aircraft construction costs and fuel NASA Langley researchers are constantly working to develop stronger lighter more durable materials that can withstand the harsh conditions of space Discoveries such as new adhesives ceramics plastics and metal alloys will not only be used in current and future aircraft and spacecraft but some of these materials have a direct impact on our every day lives such as the gas permeable polymer This special plastic membrane allows oxygen to pass freely through it making it a perfect material for extended wear contact lenses Shake It Till It Breaks To learn how materials will perform or hold up under the stresses of flight and in hostile environments they must be tested NASA Langley has testing facilities and laboratories that can heat cool bend twist shake tear and break any material and duplicate any atmospheric condition This testing allows researchers to predict how a material will act when used on air and spacecraft The following are just some of NASA Langley s testbeds http wte larc nasa gov facilities aeroelasticity transonic cfm field 14 id 2 fac 1 Transonic Dynamics Tunnel The best wind tunnel in the world for investigating the effects
