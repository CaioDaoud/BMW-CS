Report 2001 An Ecosystem Report Card 2001 sci rept pdf Research and monitoring are critical to achieving the Sanctuary s primary goal of resource protection The Keys ecosystem is diverse and complex and many of its processes and their interrelationships are not well known Also while many resource impacts are obvious and severe they are often not documented or quantified and their causes may be even less clear or completely unknown The purpose of research and monitoring is to establish a baseline of information on the resource and the various components of the ecosystem and how they interact In this way research and monitoring can ensure the effective implementation of management strategies using the best available scientific information Research and monitoring activities must focus on fundamental processes and specific management driven topics Information generated from such activities will be used to provide the public with a means to evaluate the effectiveness of the Sanctuary provide a means to distinguish between the effects of human activities and natural variability develop hypotheses about causal relationships which can then be investigated evaluate management actions and verify and validate quantitative predictive models used to evaluate and select management actions Two laws require that a research and monitoring program be implemented within the Sanctuary Section 309 of the NMSA mandates that the Secretary of Commerce shall take such action as is necessary and reasonable to promote and coordinate the use of national marine sanctuaries for research monitoring and education purposes The 1992 amendments to the FKNMSPA Section 7 a 4 are much more specific calling on the Secretary of Commerce to identify priority needs for research and amounts needed to improve management of the Sanctuary and in particular the coral reef ecosystem within the Sanctuary identify clearly the cause and effect relationships between factors threatening the health of the coral reef ecosystem in the Sanctuary and establish a long term ecological monitoring program and database including methods to disseminate information on the management of the coral reef ecosystem This web document and its associated pages describes current efforts underway to establish and continue a long term intensive Sanctuary wide monitoring program that is linked to a variety of different research efforts Background Research Photo It has long been recognized that research efforts in the Keys must be focused on priority issues and various workshops have been held to define those issues In October 1991 NOAA s Sanctuaries and Reserves Division sponsored a workshop where over 90 environmental managers and scientists presented their views and developed a list of priorities and objectives for managing a successful research program Harwell 1991 NOAA had previously 1988 funded the Marine Resources Development Foundation to sponsor a workshop to discuss management education and research issues and to develop priority action plans Miller 1988 Other pertinent planning efforts include the five year research plan of the Florida Marine Research Institute FMRI FDNR 1989 the Florida Keys Environmental Summit Report Olson 1991 an international workshop on coral reefs and their response to global climate change D Elia et al 1991 EPA s Water Quality Protection Program Plan for the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary and the management plans for the Key Largo and Looe Key National Marine Sanctuaries The Sanctuary will enable improvements in the funding focus and quality of research and the free exchange and discussion of research information It will influence research by establishing priorities encouraging open communication among researchers and managers and allowing Sanctuary staff to work closely with researchers to accomplish mutual goals Both research and monitoring activities are in this plan because they employ similar methods are often conducted by the same people and agencies and must be linked to one another Research is goal oriented with well defined testable hypotheses and is of finite duration Monitoring involves systematic long term data collection and analysis to measure the state of the resource and detect changes over time Detecting such changes can prompt management decisions can be used to evaluate the success of management strategies or to focus research on determining the reason for the change Fig 1 Figure 1 Research and Monitoring Diagram Goals and Objectives The primary goal of the Research and Monitoring Program is to provide the knowledge necessary to make informed decisions about protecting the biological diversity and natural ecosystem processes of the Sanctuary and its resources Sanctuary Goals Two acts the NMSA and the FKNMSPA establish additional research and monitoring goals including the identification of priority areas for research establishment of an ecological monitoring program development of standards based on biological monitoring or assessment to ensure the protection and restoration of water quality coral reefs and other marine resources establishment of a comprehensive water quality monitoring program to determine the sources of pollution and evaluate the results of pollution reduction efforts evaluation of progress in achieving water quality standards and protecting and restoring the Sanctuary s coral reefs and living marine resources establishment of strong communication and cooperation between the scientific community and resource managers coordination of research efforts to achieve the most beneficial results and promotion of public awareness and resource stewardship Sanctuary Objectives To achieve these goals the following objectives should be met provide leadership and coordination in research and monitoring activities by a recruiting other institutions to carry out priority actions under the Sanctuary program including volunteer groups that can foster an attitude of community stewardship and b registering researchers within the Sanctuary in order to share information about research activities and encourage coordination and cooperation among scientists and resource managers outline information needs and set priorities for research and monitoring that address issues related to management actions to be implemented and evaluated over the next five years such as a baseline studies and long term monitoring programs addressing water quality and the evaluation of water quality improvement strategies b studies on the impacts to habitats and their recovery from physical damage as well as the effectiveness of restoration actions c baseline surveys and long term monitoring that measure the ecological effects of establishing no take zones and Wildlife Management Areas and d studies that distinguish human impacts from natural variability and contribute to biologically based standards for the sustainable use of the Sanctuary encourage and provide support for research and monitoring that lead to a better understanding of key ecological processes and criteria for recognizing ecological change take a lead role in making the results of research and monitoring efforts available to all audiences either directly or through collaborating institutions ensure research is funded on an open and competitive basis coordinate research permitting among agencies and use research and monitoring results to evaluate management actions and improve them accordingly Administration Both the http www epa gov Environmental Protection Agency EPA and the http www noaa gov National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration NOAA have direct mandates to conduct monitoring efforts in the Sanctuary The integration of their efforts occurs through the management committee which has oversight over the Technical Advisory Committee TAC The TAC is composed of 24 scientists and resource managers involved in the South Florida ecosystem and provides advice and assistance to NOAA and EPA on the prioritization and design of the research and monitoring programs It also assists with research RFP s serves to integrate the research and monitoring efforts and serves to integrate interagency efforts Through MOU s the Sanctuary has designated the http www nmfs gov National Marine Fisheries Service NMFS http www sefsc noaa gov Southeast Fisheries Science Center as the reef fish monitors and the http www uncwil edu nurc National Undersea Research Center NURC as the research arm of the Sanctuary Data Management http floridamarine org The Florida Marine Research Institute is developing a data management system which will include raw data metadata and mapping tools which will be accessible on the Internet The goal is to make the data accessible to researches and managers as quickly as possible The Florida Keys Ecosystem Monitoring Integration Project NOAA s National Ocean Service and the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission s Florida Marine Research Institute FMRI are implementing jointly the Florida Keys Ecosystem Monitoring Integration project The initiative is designed to fulfill NOAA s responsibility under the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary and Protection Act which calls for the establishment of a long term ecological monitoring program and database for South Florida Florida Bay and the Florida Keys It also supports and enhances state and federal restoration efforts of the South Florida environment Over the past year descriptive site specific data about ongoing planned or historical monitoring projects were collected by NOAA and FMRI through on site interviews with principal investigators These data have been included in an ArcView based GIS that allows users to conduct queries by location time theme or other data combinations Tabular summaries charts and maps can be produced from this system The monitoring data base and the GIS are prerequisites for developing a Florida Keys marine ecosystem monitoring plan This plan will be developed through a series of structured collaborative workshops that will be issue oriented and will rely upon the knowledge and experience of the workshop participants The resulting regional monitoring plan is expected to provide not only consensus on the details of a monitoring program such as the hypotheses to be tested location and number of monitoring sites frequency of measurement etc but also alternatives and priorities based on available resources and short term versus long term information needs The plan also will indicate clearly the roles and requisite activities of each participant Existing Research and Monitoring Programs Research Affilitates Research is conducted by many groups including local State and Federal
