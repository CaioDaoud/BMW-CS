on a sunny day look down and examine your shadow It s dark in the middle pale and fuzzy around the edges and it always points away from the sun Although we seldom see it Earth has a shadow too much like your own dark inside pale outside pointing away from the sun Way away Earth s shadow stretches almost a million miles into space far enough to reach the moon On Saturday Nov 8th the full moon will glide through our planet s shadow Observers on every continent except Australia can see the event which astronomers call a lunar eclipse news subscribe htm subscription image Sign up for EXPRESS SCIENCE NEWS delivery Right Frank Reddy of http celestialdelights info Celestial Delights created this animation of the upcoming lunar eclipse Sky watchers will first notice a shadowy darkness creeping over the moon s northeastern limb at 23 32 Universal Time UT on Nov 8th Watching Earth s shadow sweep across the moon s terrain is fun Even better is totality when the entire moon is covered in shadow Totality begins at 01 06 UT on Nov 9th and lasts for 25 minutes Note the table below converts UT to US standard time zones The totally eclipsed moon won t be totally dark and that s what makes totality delightful Earth s atmosphere bends sunlight into our planet s shadow and onto the moon This sunlight is reddened as it travels a great distance through our dusty atmosphere and so the moon looks red Sunsets on Earth look red for the same reason Nov 8 2003 Lunar Eclipse Schedule Moon enters Earth s shadow totality begins totality ends Moon exits Earth s shadow Universal Time 23 32

events that happen before local moonrise which on Nov 8th will be between 4 45 p m and 5 00 p m for most observers So e g almost none of the eclipse will be visible from Hawaii all of it will be visible from the Eastern time zone This is the second lunar eclipse of 2003 Observers of the first one in May might remember that the moon was nearly invisible during totality This eclipse will be different During totality on Nov 8 9th the moon will remain relatively bright and there will be a pleasing gradient of color across the face of the moon pale white on one side crimson red on the other Why the difference It has to do with the structure of Earth s shadow and where the moon glides through it Earth s shadow is shaped like a cone with two parts The umbra on the inside is dark while the penumbra on the outside is pale Remember your personal shadow It has these parts too The umbra is where the sun s light is completely blocked The penumbra that pale fringe around the umbra is where the sun s light is only partially blocked see caption Lunar eclipses are considered total when the moon passes completely into Earth s umbral shadow In May 2003 the moon passed close to the middle of the umbra The eclipse was therefore long 52 minutes of totality and dark In November 2003 the moon will merely skim the umbra producing an eclipse that s shorter 25 minutes of totality and brighter Right Earth s cone shaped shadow and the moon s path through it on Nov 8th and 9th 2003 images lunareclipse2 LE2003Fig4 gif more The total phase on Nov 9th lasts from 01 06 UT until 01 31 UT Then Earth s shadow will begin to recede and by 03 04 UT it will all be over the shadow gone the glaring full moon back to normal People in Europe and western Africa will be able to watch the entire eclipse For them it occurs while the moon is high in the night sky North Americans near the Atlantic Ocean will also have a splendid view North Americans on the Pacific side of the continent however are going to see just the last half of the event the first half happens before moonrise Even half an eclipse is worth watching though And just in case you re wondering what this lunar eclipse might
