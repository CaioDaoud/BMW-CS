support of the major Laboratory missions The Chemistry and Chemical Engineering Division CChED has a primary mission to support the major Laboratory missions To accomplish this and to be recognized by the scientific community at large five scientific disciplines have been identified and are being utilized to foster growth in science and technology Each discipline has a leader who is responsible for the growth and development of that capability in both the programmatic and technical areas See cms org folder cched orgcht html CChED organization chart Key activities and important recent accomplishments in each discipline are summarized to the right Staff scientist synthesizing tailored polymer materials Staff scientist synthesizing tailored polymer materials cched comp chem html Computational Chemistry is a central part of the research portfolio in CMS Computational chemistry of energetic materials is investigating detonation and slow combustion of explosives kinetics of high energy density materials and electronic structure modeling for high explosives Combustion chemistry in CChED deals primarily with model simulations of ignition flame propagation quenching and emissions from internal combustion engines Reaction mechanisms have been developed to study the influence of fuel molecular structure on ignition properties such as octane and cetane ratings of automotive fuels Computational chemistry of heavy elements uses relativistic electronic structure techniques to study actinide element chemistry Chemical warfare agent modeling is developing kinetic models for surrogate and actual CW agent chemicals for use in a variety of atmospheric dispersion and other accident and terrorist scenarios top Back to top Chemical Engineering is a fully matrixed capability with staff involved in a number of high profile projects including optics development for the National Ignition Facility NIF high explosives and energetic materials development for the Stockpile Stewardship Program SSP in the Defense and Nuclear Technologies DNT directorate and assessments of foreign threat assessments and capabilities for development of weapons of mass destruction in the Nonproliferation Arms Control and International Security NAI directorate Specific highlights include the following cched opt mats html NIF Program Support the development of techniques to mitigate etch pitting on NIF optical surfaces other strategies to reduce defects in optics resulting from manufacturing and processing and significant improvements in production of diffractive optics

Molten Salt Oxidation Program Counterproliferation Analysis and Planning System CAPS program in NAI CChED s chemical engineers are major participants in the efforts to evaluate capabilities of foreign organizations to produce weapons of mass destruction by analyzing their resources and industrial capabilities 94 cm diameter diffraction grating A 94 cm diameter diffraction grating produced by our Diffractive Optics Group Specific highlights include the following Computational Chemistry of Energetic Materials the use of electronic structure techniques to propose a novel energetic material consisting of a nitrogen analog N60 of the familiar carbon buckyball although only metastable this compound would provide enormous energy storage capabilities Continued development of computational tools to model reactive flow in energetic materials led to a new edition of the internationally used Cheetah code Combustion Chemistry simulations of a new way to understand diesel engine combustion from ignition through soot formation and burnout Related chemical kinetic research demonstrated how oxygenated hydrocarbon fuels reduce soot emissions from diesel engines and how a few particularly important gas phase chemical reactions control most ignition phenomena including detonations and engine knock A collaboration under a CRADA with Cummins Engine Co developed and demonstrated the central role played by gas phase chemical kinetics in the new automotive engine concept named Homogeneous Charge Compression Ignition HCCI which shows great promise for enhanced combustion efficiency and drastically reduced pollutant emissions Computational Chemistry of CW Agents has led to the development of kinetic models for a number of frequently used surrogate compounds to simulate the reaction of the actual chemical warfare CW agent Sarin A detailed kinetic model for Sarin was developed for the first time and model comparisons between the chemistry of Sarin and its surrogates improved our ability to simulate CW phenomena Energetic Materials represents a key scientific as well as a programmatic activity for CChED Besides the aforementioned computational chemistry efforts activities in Energetic Materials include performance and aging testing materials characterization chemical mechanical properties thermodynamics and equation of state and synthetic organic chemistry The Energetic Materials Center EMC is a world class experimental facility that is a unique cornerstone of CChED In addition to the EMC the Energetic Materials Program maintains a considerable range of facilities and experimental activities at Site 300 where large scale experiments and synthesis of explosives are conducted Chemical Synthesis and Processing produces novel materials for a wide range of programmatic efforts The most highly developed capability consists of the sol gel and aerogel research and technology that has been producing coating materials for NIF optics and ultra low density materials for DNT and other programs for some years An important new development has generalized the synthesis technique for low density materials so that aerogels and other ultra low density materials can now be synthesized incorporating almost every element in the periodic table rather than the four or five elements previously available thus increasing the flexibility and variety of applications of such materials Another new project with significant new accomplishments consists of the development of a new glucose sensor for use in miniaturized implanted diagnostic and treatment methodologies This work performed under a CRADA with Medtronic Minimed received a DOE Bright Light Award as well as a Federal Laboratory Consortium Award this year for its accomplishments and promise for the future New projects in chemical synthesis involve development of new molecules with exciting potential applications as microscopic biosensors dendritic structures for development of new polymer systems and functionalized thiacrown ethers for waste water remediation Other projects are directed towards synthesis of new molecules for studies of material aging and other unique nanomaterials Other novel developments are intended to combine unique CChED capabilities in chemical synthesis with programmatic needs of key program collaborators A new example is the coupling of aerogel technology with the key scientific capabilities of energetic materials leading to the development of energetic nanomaterials with variable compositions that can provide variable and programmable energy release Figure 3 shows an example of this type of sol gel derived pyrotechnic material This type of collaboration may have enormous impacts on the future of energetic materials for almost limitless applications Physical Chemistry has historically built a base of fundamental understanding of materials compatibility and chemistries through chemical optical spectroscopy Key capabilities also include laser induced chemistry and general photo chemistry data processing molecular dynamics and kinetics CChED physical chemists contribute to weapon materials compatibility and aging studies analysis and testing of energetic materials studies of NIF optics damage mechanisms and ICF and NIF target design and production and to applied spectroscopy for NAI s programs Similar to the chemical engineering capability physical chemistry is also a fully matrixed workforce that provides research and leadership for a wide range of Laboratory efforts The growth of these scientific capabilities is directly related to long range programmatic needs and to facilitating the growth of new strategic opportunities CChED will continue to improve its collaborations with Laboratory programs and to initiate scientific and technical capabilities for their future needs top Back to top February 28 2003 UCRL WEB 150245 http www universityofcalifornia edu welcomenf html UC http www
