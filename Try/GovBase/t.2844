readiness assessments technical assistance teams regional forums for emergency responders grants for drills training and accelerating technology and research projects FTA s 5 POINT SECURITY INITIATIVE

FTA has developed a list of SecurityInitiatives Top20 default asp Security Program Action Items for transit agencies that are the most important elements transit agencies should incorporate into their System Security Program Plans These top SecurityInitiatives Top20 default asp twenty 20 items are based on good security practices identified through FTA s Security Assessments and Technical Assistance provided to the largest transit agencies FTA is working with transit agencies to encourage them to incorporate these practices into their programs TRANSIT CRITICAL NATIONAL INFRASTRUCTURE Transit is a critical high risk and high consequence national asset Everyday transit provides mobility to millions of Americans in our most densely populated urban areas and serves the largest economical and financial centers in the nation Every workday transit moves more than 14 million passengers In two weeks transit moves more passengers than AMTRAK moves in year In one month transit moves more passengers than U S airlines move in a year Transit systems are designed to provide not only open easy access to passengers but to run under or along side our largest business and government buildings intermodal transportation centers and many of our nations most visible public icons The U S D O T Office of Intelligence and Security estimated that in the 1990 s transit was the target of 20 to 35 percent of terrorist attacks worldwide Transit is designed and operated as an open environment it is by its very nature a high risk high consequence target for terrorist More than 9 5 billion passengers a year ride our transit systems Some of the largest transit systems report that more than 1 000 people a minute enters their largest intermodal facilities during rush hour Transit subways travel under key government buildings business centers and harbors Worldwide transit has been a frequent terrorist target including bombings in the London and Paris subways the sarin gas attack in Tokyo and bus bombings in Israel FTA s 5 POINT SECURITY INITIATIVE Since September 11th FTA has been learning sharing and applying all that we can to enhance transit security We have learned from the terrorism experiences in London Paris Tokyo and Israel We have formed working relationships with the intelligence community and have applied their expertise and knowledge to the transit industry We gained a tremendous amount of information on the readiness and needs of the transit industry from the aggressive five point initiative we began immediately after September 11th To date FTA has 1 Completed 37 threat and vulnerability assessments Multi disciplinary teams including experts in anti terrorism security and transit operations assessed the readiness of the largest and highest risk transit agencies Based on these assessments FTA has provided specific feedback to individual agencies on how to improve their security systems and reduce vulnerabilities as well as information on best practices to all transit agencies 2 Deployed technical assistance teams Emergency response planning and technical assistance teams are being deployed to the top 50 60 transit agencies to help them to implement the major components of a systematic security program including current security and emergency response plans training assessments security awareness materials for transit employees and customers etc 3 Awarded grants for drills by emergency responders and transit Grants of up to 50 000 were awarded to 83 transit agencies to conduct tabletop and full scale drills with regional emergency responders to test and improve their security and emergency response plans 4 Accelerated technology deployment FTA accelerated the deployment and testing of the pdf PROTECT factsheet pdf PROTECT system for chemical detection in subway systems In addition research funds were refocused to conduct 11 short term quick payoff research projects identified by the transit industry 5 Facilitated training and regional collaboration A new 2 hour security awareness course for front line employees and supervisors is being delivered nationwide This winter FTA will complete 17 regional forums to promote regional collaboration and coordination among fire police and medical emergency responders and transit To date nearly 1 300 individuals including representatives of 125 transit agencies and their community partners have participated in these 2 day forums held in 10 locations across the country SYSTEMS APPROACH FOR HOMELAND SECURITY Research and policy leaders also call for an integrated systematic approach to security The Transportation Research Board s new security report SecurityInitiatives Items sr270 pdf Deterrence Protection and Preparation recommends layered security systems that are well integrated throughout transportation operations Such security systems have interleaved and concentric features e g fencing security patrols and closed circuit television so a breach of any one layer will not defeat the entire system Each layer provides backup for the others Fundamentally security should be built into all aspects of transit operations as they are developed and created rather than added as an afterthought These concepts are found throughout FTA s security program but given the age of most transit systems we are to a large extent playing catch up with respect to security Indeed security is in its program infancy just as safety was 10 to 15 years ago before every agency dramatically increased its focus and resources to address the alarming number of transportation fatalities NEXT STEPS With the knowledge and expertise we have acquired FTA is enhancing its strategies and moving forward to further enhance transit security We will continue to tap the expertise of TSA the intelligence community the transit industry and others to help strengthen transit security We will continue many of our current programs and add new initiatives to meet a variety of needs that we have identified over the last year as well as the priorities and strategies identified in the Office of Homeland Security s national strategy as follows Preventing Terrorist Attacks Because of the openness of transit facilities timely threat and intelligence information is critical for the transit agencies to strategically target resources based on real time threat information FTA is tapping into existing intelligence information and warning networks and developing new intelligence sharing systems to provide two way communication between the intelligence community and the transit industry We are also launching a nationwide transit watch program with the transit industry that will draw upon more than 350 000 transit employees and millions of passengers to watch for and report suspicious activities For more information go to SecurityInitiatives Items isac asp Intelligence Sharing and Analysis Center with APTA SecurityInitiatives Items transitwatch
