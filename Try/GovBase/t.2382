state is required to adopt the most recent edition of model building codes with necessary amendments based upon enabling legislation Model codes are defined as any building code drafted by private organizations and apply to all occupancies in California when adopted by the state Starting in 1988 California adopted model building codes for statewide application which were predominantly adopted by the western and central states of the United States The eastern states predominantly adopted the model building codes of the Building Official and Code Administrators International and the southern states predominantly adopted the model building codes of the Southern Building Code Congress International The codes adopted by California in 1988 were as follows The Uniform Building Code of the International Conference of Building Officials that serves as the basis for the California Building Code The National Electrical Code of the National Fire Protection Association that serves as the basis for the California Electrical Code The Uniform Mechanical Code of the International Conference of Building Officials and International Association of Plumbing and Mechanical Officials that served as the basis for the California Mechanical Code The Uniform Plumbing Code of the International Association of Plumbing and Mechanical Officials that serves as the basis of the California Plumbing Code The Uniform Fire Code of the Western Fire Chiefs Association that serves as the basis for the California Fire Code The Uniform Code for Building Conservation of the International Conference of Building Officials that serves as the basis for the California Code for Building Conservation However in 1994 nationwide movements to establish a set of building codes that could be used nationwide grew The movement resulted in the following changes to the codes adopted by California The publication of the Uniform Mechanical Code of the International Conference of Building Officials and International Association of Plumbing and Mechanical Officials ended with their 1991 edition The publication of the Uniform codes of the International Conference of Building Officials ended with their 1997 edition The International Conference of Buildings Officials partnered with the Building Officials and Code Administrator International and the Southern Building Code Congress International to develop a nationwide set of building codes which is referred to as the International codes Earlier this year these three code organizations consolidated and formed the International Code Council The International Code Council is publishing a full set of building codes building fire mechanical plumbing existing building etc The National Fire Protection Association developed and published a new building code and fire code NFPA 5000 building code and NFPA 1 Uniform Fire Code The International Association of Plumbing and Mechanical Officials the Western Fire Chiefs Association and the National Fire Protection Association agreed to market and support a nationwide set of building codes based upon the codes published by their respective organization The publication of the Uniform Fire Code of Western Fire Chief Association ended with their 2000 edition These changes caused the state to evaluate the emerging building codes and adopt some new model building codes that will serve as the basis for the California Building Standards Code The Department of Housing and Community Development the Division of the State Architect the Office of the State Fire Marshal and the Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development are completing their evaluation this month They are presenting their reports and proposed choices on June 11 2003 to the Code Change Committee of the California
