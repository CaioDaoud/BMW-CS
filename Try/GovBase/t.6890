Promoting Health and Disease Prevention index shtml CONCLUSION Conclusion index shtml ENDNOTES Endnotes and References Executive Summary Expenditures for health care in the United States continue to rise and are estimated to reach 1 66 trillion in 2003 Much of these costs can be attributed to the diagnosis and treatment of chronic diseases and conditions such as diabetes obesity cardiovascular disease and asthma Approximately 129 million U S adults are overweight or obese which costs this Nation anywhere from 69 billion to 117 billion per year In 2000 an estimated 17 million people 6 2 percent of the population had diabetes costing the U S approximately 132 billion People with diabetes lost more than 8 days per year from work accounting for 14 million disability days Heart disease and stroke are the first and third leading causes of death in the United States In 2003 alone 1 1 million Americans will have a heart attack Cardiovascular diseases cost the Nation more than 300 billion each year Approximately 23 million adults and 9 million children have been diagnosed with asthma at some point within their lifetime with costs near 14 billion per year A much smaller amount is spent on preventing these conditions There is accumulating evidence that much of the morbidity and mortality associated with these chronic diseases may be preventable For many Americans individual behavior and lifestyle choices influence the development and course of these chronic conditions Unhealthy behaviors such as a poor diet lack of physical activity and tobacco use are risk factors for many chronic conditions and diseases A high calorie diet and sedentary lifestyle commonly result in excessive weight gain Overweight and obesity are risk factors for a large number of chronic diseases most significantly type 2 diabetes congestive heart failure stroke and hypertension Encouraging individuals to adopt healthy habits and practices may reduce the burden of chronic disease in communities throughout the United States Recently public and private efforts and programs are increasingly designed to promote healthy behaviors Employers are becoming more aware that overweight and obesity lack of physical activity and tobacco use are adversely affecting the health and productivity of their employees and ultimately the businesses bottom line As a result innovative employers are providing their employees with a variety of work site based health promotion and disease prevention programs These programs have been shown to improve employee health increase productivity and yield a significant return on investment for the employer For example a recent review of health promotion and disease management programs found a significant return on investment for these programs with benefit to cost ratios ranging from 1 49 to 4 91 median of 3 14 in benefits for every dollar spent on the program Several major companies with award winning cost saving health promotion disease prevention programs are profiled in this report and include N 1 1 Motorola s wellness program which stet the company 3 93 for every 1 invested Northeast Utilities WellAware Program which in its first 24 months reduced lifestyle and behavioral claims by 1 400 000 Caterpillar s Healthy Balance program which is projected to result in long term savings of 700 million by 2015 Johnson Johnson s Health and Wellness Program which has produced average annual health care savings of 224 66 per employee By changing the way they live individual Americans could change their personal health status and the health landscape of the Nation dramatically In 2003 it is estimated that the U S will spend 1 66 trillion on health care expenditures N 2 2 Health care spending is growing faster than the gross domestic product GDP and is projected to account for 17 7 percent of the GDP by 2012 up from 14 1 percent in 2001 A small number of chronic disorders such as diabetes and cardiovascular diseases account for the majority of deaths each year and the medical care costs of people with chronic diseases account for more than 75 percent of the nation s medical care costs N 3 3 As the population of the United States ages substantially over the next several decades the prevalence of chronic diseases and their impact on health care costs will likely increase Each individual s health is shaped by many factors including medical care social circumstances and behavioral choices N 4 4 Increasingly there is clear evidence that the major chronic conditions that account for so much of the morbidity and mortality in the U S and the enormous direct and indirect costs associated with them in large part are preventable and that to a considerable degree they stem from and are exacerbated by individual behaviors In particular overweight and obesity lack of physical activity and smoking greatly increase the risk of developing the most serious chronic disorders Most of the dollars spent on health care in the United States however are for the direct care of medical conditions while only a very small portion is targeted on preventing those conditions N 5 5 As Americans see health care expenditures continue to increase it is important to focus on strategies that reduce the prevalence and cost of preventable diseases This paper summarizes recent research findings on the prevalence effects and costs of some of these key preventable conditions and highlights several award winning business prevention programs that make common cents N 6 6 So many of our health problems can be avoided through diet exercise and making sure we take care of ourselves By promoting healthy lifestyles we can improve the quality of life for all Americans and reduce health care costs dramatically Tommy G Thompson Secretary DHHS OVERWEIGHT AND OBESITY Public health officials refer to obesity as an epidemic The prevalence of overweight and obesity has increased dramatically in recent years doubling since 1980 and now is seen by the CDC as one of the top threats to the health of the Nation N 7 7 Weight gain is a direct function of an imbalance between the amount of calories consumed and the amount of calories expended by an individual While there are some genetic determinants of obesity much if not most of the recent increase in prevalence of obesity in the U S population stems from changes in people s diets and the level of their physical activity To some extent these dietary changes may reflect the greater availability of pre packaged foods low cost big portion restaurant meals and soft drinks all of which may be high in sugar calories and or fat This increase in obesity has occurred even though the public generally is more educated about what constitutes a healthy diet and ingredients in food products have become more clearly identified on labels On the other side of the equation changing people s habits related to physical activity has proved to be a challenging task Individuals who want to be more physically active often find it difficult to do so because of demands and other constraints associated with their work family and community According to a recent study by the National Center for Health Statistics NCHS less than a third of US adults engage in regular leisure time physical activity and only about one fifth of adults engage in a high level of overall physical activity N 8 8 One study looked at adults who were trying to lose or not gain weight and found that less than 20 percent of the individuals were following recommendations about increasing physical activity and reducing calories N 9 9 Also notable is a finding that only 42 8 percent of obese people who had routine checkups in the past months had been urged during those visits to lose weight N 10 10 The current widely used definition for overweight in adults is a body mass index BMI of 25 to 29 9 and for obesity in adults a BMI of 30 or over BMI is calculated solely on the basis of the height and weight of an individual the calculation does not take into consideration the sex of the individual the proportion of fat and muscle or different body shapes Waist circumference is also an independent predictor of risk factors and morbidity N 11 11 Overweight and obesity are defined differently for children and adolescents they are considered to be overweight at or above the 95th percentile of the sex specific BMI for age growth charts Obesity in children is not specifically defined Motorola Forty five thousand U S employees family members retirees benefit from Motorola s

guidelines obesity bmi tbl htm www nhlbi nih gov guidelines obesity bmi tbl htm a HGT refers to height in inches As displayed above an individual who is 5 feet 10 inches and weighs 195 pounds would have a BMI of 28 and would be considered overweight An adult who is 5 feet 10 inches and weighs 250 pounds would have a BMI of 36 and would be considered obese The Prevalence of Overweight and Obesity Recent estimates indicate that more than129 million U S adults are considered to be overweight or obese N 12 12 Approximately two thirds of the adult population are either overweight or obese and slightly less than one third are obese N 13 13 Note While there have been lower estimates of the proportions of overweight and obese individuals recently they were based on self reported measures of height and weight and consequently are most likely under estimates N 14 14 Even though their specific prevalence estimates may differ somewhat all studies in recent years have shown dramatic increases in the prevalence of overweight and obesity with one study determining that obesity rose from 22 9 percent to 30 5 percent between 1988 and 2000 while extreme obesity defined as a BMI of 40 or over increased from 2 9 percent to 4 7 percent over this period N 15 15 Figure 1 Prevalence of Obesity by Age Figure1 Source of data 1991 2001 Prevalence of Obesity Among U S Adults by Characteristic Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System Self reported data CDC website http www cdc gov nccdphp dnpa obesity trend prev char htm www cdc gov nccdphp dnpa obesity trend prev char htm While the prevalence of overweight and obesity is high and increasing in all ages in men and women across different racial and ethnic groups and across education and income levels it does vary somewhat Among adults the age group with the smallest proportion of obese people is ages 18 through 29 years However this same age group has shown the largest percentage increase in obesity of all age groups rising from 7 1 percent in 1991 to 14 percent in 2001 a 97 percent increase N 16 16 N 17 17 Dramatic increases in the prevalence of overweight and obesity also have occurred in children and adolescents of both sexes with approximately 15 3 percent of children aged 6 to 11 years and 15 5 percent of adolescents aged 12 to 19 years considered to be overweight N 18 18 The prevalence in adolescents has almost tripled in the past twenty years N 19 19 More than 10 percent of children aged 2 through 5 years are overweight N 20 20 As is the case with adults children and adolescents have become less physically active and are consuming more calories They also have greater access to increasingly larger portions of foods high in calories fat and sugar Research has shown that children will eat more when served large portions than they will when they serve themselves N 21 21 and when adolescents eat on their own and not with their families they are less likely to eat healthy food including fruits and vegetables N 22 22 The Effects of Overweight and Obesity Overweight and obesity significantly affect the health quality of life and life expectancy of the U S population Excess weight is a risk factor for a large number of diseases and chronic conditions it can contribute to the onset of these disorders and it can make them worse Conversely overweight individuals can reduce the risk for some chronic disorders by losing as little as 5 percent to 15 percent of their weight N 23 23 Obesity is believed to be associated with more chronic disorders and worse physical health related quality of life than is smoking or problem drinking N 24 24 Estimates of the deaths of U S adults due to causes related to obesity range from 280 000 to 325 000 each year N 25 25 N 26 26 N 27 27 There is evidence that overweight and obesity raise the risk for a wide variety of medical conditions Overweight and obesity raise the risk for type 2 diabetes high blood pressure high cholesterol levels coronary heart disease congestive heart failure angina pectoris stroke asthma osteoarthritis musculoskeletal disorders gallbladder disease sleep apnea and respiratory problems gout bladder control problems poor female reproductive health complications of pregnancy menstrual irregularities infertility irregular ovulation cancers of the uterus breast prostate kidney liver pancreas esophagus colon and rectum It is estimated that 47 million U S adults have a cluster of medical conditions referred to as the metabolic syndrome characterized by insulin resistance and the presence of obesity abdominal fat high blood sugar and triglycerides high blood cholesterol and high blood pressure N 28 28 Recent research also suggests that obesity increases the risk for progression to advanced stages of age related macular degeneration a disorder affecting a large proportion of the elderly N 29 29 Overweight and obesity also can reduce mobility and physical endurance can lead to psychological disorders and can result in social academic and job discrimination N 30 30 N 31 31 N 32 32 N 33 33 N 34 34 N 35 35 N 36 36 Estimates of the number of years of life lost as a result of overweight and obesity range as high as 20 years of life lost for certain age and racial ethnic groups For example a 20 year old white male could realize a 17 percent reduction in life expectancy due to obesity N 37 37 Years of life lost is a simple measure of mortality and does not reflect the fullimpact of obesity on morbidity and quality of life It has been suggested that measuring the number of healthy disability free years of life lost might be more informative than focusing only on actual years lost N 38 38 Researchers have suggested that in terms of the physical quality of life the effect of obesity can be the equivalent of aging as much as 30 years N 39 39 Figure 2 Life Expectancy Figure 2 Source of data Ref 37 The Costs of Overweight and Obesity Over the last several decades researchers have provided many estimates of the costs of overweight and obesity These estimates differ according to their scope e g the individual person a particular company or health plan or the Nation as a whole the timeliness of the data and the methods used to derive them including how obesity is defined how the prevalence of obesity is determined what associated disorders are included the degree to which these disorders and obesity are considered to be associated how costs are defined and the assumptions used in calculating those costs As with other chronic conditions estimates may focus on direct costs to the community including the costs of health care services physicians and other health care professionals hospital admissions and medicines indirect costs such as loss of productivity caused by absenteeism disability and premature death or personal costs such as reduced earnings higher insurance costs reduced quality of life and out of pocket expenses for individuals N 40 40 These cost estimates are approximations and it becomes even more difficult to estimate the costs of the effects of obesity over very long periods of time Health Care Utilization Research has shown that as body mass increases so too do health care utilization and costs N 41 41 Obesity may account for as much as a 36 increase in costs for inpatient and ambulatory care for individuals a greater increase than that attributed to aging 20 years smoking or problem drinking N 42 42 In addition to using more physician and hospital services obese individuals have high annual costs for medications particularly those for diabetes and cardiovascular disease CVD One researcher estimated that obese individuals may pay as much as 77 percent more for medications compared to non obese individuals N 43 43 Conversely there is evidence that patients who lose weight reduce their use of these kinds of medications and even modest sustained weight loss a reduction of 10 percent in body weight may reduce expected lifetime health care costs for major obesity related diseases by 2 200 to 5 300 depending on age gender and initial BMI N 44 44 N 45 45 N 46 46 N 47 47 Personal Costs Even the financial well being of individuals may be associated with their weight Researchers analyzed data from the University of Michigan Health and Retirement Study on more than 7 000 men and women between the ages of 57 and 67 and found that heavier women had significantly smaller individual net worth even after controlling for health marital status and other demographic factors N 48 48 The association between obesity and the net worth of the men were smaller and not statistically significant Significant Costs Most estimates of total direct and indirect combined costs of overweight and obesity to the Nation range from 69 billion per year to 117 billion per year N 49 49 N 50 50 N 51 51 N 52 52 N 53 53 This estimated 117 billion includes 61 billion for direct costs and 56 billion for indirect costs One study of the costs of treating major disorders relating to obesity estimated that obesity cost the Nation as much as 102 billion for direct costs alone in 1999 These amounts represent 27 percent to 31 percent of the total costs of treating these disorders regardless of obesity N 54 54 Included in this 102 billion were 6 7 7 4 billion for arthritis 25 5 30 6 billion for heart disease 18 4 20 5 billion for type 2 diabetes 8 3 9 6 billion for hypertension and 6 1 8 1 billion for stroke Contributing to the overall trends annual hospital costs for obesity related disorders in children ages 6 to 17 years increased from 35 million to 127 million between 1979 and 2000 N 55 55 DaimlerChrysler DaimlerChrysler is an international automotive and transportation company with over 95 000 employees throughout the United States Its National Wellness Program began in 1985 and is a negotiated benefit between DaimlerChrysler Corporation and the International Union UAW All U S sites with 500 employees have on site contracted health and fitness business partners over 100 FTEs to administer program The program has voluntary participation Key components of the National Wellness Program includes targeted education programs based on identified health risks and interests focused education programs which support employees throughout process of lifestyle change smoking cessation weight management cholesterol management and fitness activities one time workshops multi session classes individual counseling and self directed modules maintenance strategies which include ongoing awareness interactive campaigns group support with on site services e g fitness facilities cafeteria vending programs walking routes Savings estimates revealed that participation in the National Wellness Program was associated with significant savings in dollars per employee from 1991 to 1995 with the highest dollar savings achieved in 1995 16 per employee per month Evaluation of the program showed that health risk assessment was associated with significant and substantial reductions in healthcare costs Employees who completed one two or three health risk assessments on average had lower 1997 health care costs of 112 89 134 22 and 152 29 respectively Employees who had completed at least one health risk assessment and participated in an additional wellness activity had an average cost savings of 200 35 per year To contact DaimlerChrysler for more detailed information see http www Chrysler com www Chrysler com Increasing U S Health Care Costs The direct health care costs of overweight and obesity represent a significant portion of total annual U S health care expenditures with estimates ranging from 4 3 percent of total expenditures to as much as 9 1 percent N 56 56 N 57 57 Moreover Medicare and Medicaid may finance as much as half of these costs with Medicare covering the larger share due to the more substantial medical problems associated with obesity in the elderly Researchers have found that obese people who reach 65 years of age have much larger annual Medicare expenditures than non obese people For the period between 1996 and 1998 a 15 percent increase in annual per capita Medicare spending is attributable to being overweight and a 37 percent increase is attributed to being obese N 58 58 Figure 3 Per Capita Medicare Spending 1996 1998 Figure 3 Source of data Ref 54 Impact on Businesses Employers and businesses bear a sizable portion of costs associated with treating obesity related conditions primarily in terms of lost productivity and the increased cost of health and disability insurance Studies of overweight and obese employees have shown that obese employees take more sick leave than non obese employees and are twice as likely to have high level absenteeism seven or more health related absences during the last six months N 59 59 N 60 60 In addition another study found a reduction in the use of sick leave and disability pension by obese employees in the second and third years following surgical treatment of their obesity N 61 61 An analysis of business costs in the late 1980s through the mid 1990s found that in 1994 due to conditions associated with obesity employees lost 39 3 million workdays a 50 percent increase since 1988 made 62 7 million visits to physician offices a 88 percent increase had 239 million restricted activity days a 36 percent increase and 89 5 bed days a 28 percent increase N 62 62 N 63 63 The costs to U S businesses of obesity related health problems in 1994 added up to almost 13 billion with approximately 8 billion of this paying for health insurance expenditures 2 4 billion for sick leave 1 8 billion for life insurance and close to 1 billion for disability insurance N 64 64 DIABETES Diabetes is a group of diseases in which blood glucose sugar levels are elevated either because of failure to make adequate amounts of the hormone insulin or failure of cells to respond to insulin Diabetes results from interaction between inherited autoimmune and environmental factors There are two principal forms of diabetes that account for the majority of cases Type 1 diabetes often called insulin dependent diabetes mellitus or juvenile onset diabetes develops when the body s immune system destroys pancreatic beta cells the cells in the body that make the hormone insulin that regulates blood glucose Thus the pancreas can no longer produce insulin This form of diabetes usually strikes children and young adults and requires them to take several insulin injections a day to survive Type 1 diabetes may account for 5 to 10 percent of all diagnosed cases of diabetes N 65 65 Type 2 diabetes is sometimes termed adult onset diabetes or non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus even though some affected individuals require insulin for control of the disease Type 2 diabetes usually begins as insulin resistance a disorder in which cells do not use insulin properly As it progresses the pancreas gradually loses its ability to produce insulin Type 2 diabetes often appears after age 40 although it is now being diagnosed increasingly in children and adolescents This form of diabetes accounts for 90 to 95 percent of all diagnosed cases of diabetes N 66 66 In addition some women develop diabetes during pregnancy This form of diabetes is called gestational diabetes and affects 2 to 5 percent of all pregnancies After pregnancy 5 to 10 percent of women with gestational diabetes are found to have Type 2 diabetes and women who have had gestational diabetes are at increased risk for developing Type 2 diabetes in the next 5 to 10 years N 67 67 Other less common types of diabetes result from specific genetic conditions surgery drugs malnutrition infections and other illnesses Taken together these causes account for 1 to 5 percent of all diagnosed cases of diabetes The Prevalence of Diabetes Diabetes affects a substantial proportion of the U S adult population In 2000 it was estimated that 17 million people 6 2 percent of the population had diabetes N 68 68 This included 11 1 million people with diagnosed diabetes and 5 9 million people whose diabetes was undiagnosed Of this number 7 8 million were men and 9 1 million were women One million new cases of diabetes in people aged 20 years or older are diagnosed each year and diabetes was the 6th leading cause of death in 1999 While increases in the prevalence of diabetes have been documented in the past more research is needed to determine the extent to which the prevalence of diabetes is changing and the factors that are contributing to such changes Most research suggests that overweight and obesity and lack of physical activity are associated with an increased risk for diabetes However it is possible that an association between recent increases in the prevalence of obesity and overweight and the prevalence of diabetes may not be immediately apparent but only observed over the long term N 69 69 Risk factors for Type 1 diabetes include autoimmune genetic and environmental factors Type 2 diabetes is associated with older age obesity family history of diabetes prior history of gestational diabetes impaired glucose tolerance physical inactivity and race ethnicity African Americans Hispanic Latino Americans American Indians and some Asian Pacific Islanders are at particularly high risk for Type 2 diabetes N 70 70 Increasingly health care providers are finding more and more children and teens with Type 2 diabetes which is usually found in people over age 40 Although there are no national data it is estimated that Type 2 diabetes represents 8 to 45 percent of all patients with diabetes currently diagnosed in large U S pediatric centers However this may represent an underestimate and the incidence may likely be rising African American Hispanic Latino American and American Indian children who are obese and who have a family history of Type 2 diabetes are at especially high risk N 71 71 The CDC has estimated that one in three persons born in the U S in 2000 has a life time risk of developing diabetes unless significant changes occur in patterns of eating and exercising and that 39 million people in the U S could have diabetes by 2050 The Effects of Diabetes Untreated or poorly treated diabetes can result in death or significant disability including heart disease and stroke kidney failure blindness and lower limb amputations More than 60 percent of non traumatic lower limb amputations occur among diabetics Diabetes is the leading cause of new cases of blindness for adults aged 20 74 and is the leading cause of treated end stage renal disease accounting for 43 percent of new cases Other complications of diabetes include high blood pressure nervous system damage dental disease complications of pregnancy acute life threatening events caused by biochemical imbalances and susceptibility to other illnesses and worse prognosis over the course of these illnesses N

detailed information see http www up com www up com The Costs of Diabetes A comparison of national cost estimates over time is difficult because of changes in the U S population and changes in the cost of health care services The American Diabetes Association ADA estimated the national cost of diabetes in 1997 to be 98 billion N 73 73 The ADA has updated this estimate for 2002 to 132 billion This includes 91 8 billion in direct medical expenditures 23 2 billion for diabetes care 24 6 billion for chronic complications attributable to diabetes and 44 1 billion for excess prevalence of general medical conditions with inpatient days nursing home care and office visits making up the biggest expenditure categories by service setting Indirect expenditures totaled 39 8 billion and resulted from lost workdays restricted activity days mortality and permanent disability due to diabetes CDC research has shown that people with diabetes lost 8 3 days per year from work accounting for 14 million disability days compared to 1 7 days for people without diabetes N 74 74 The ADA study examined total U S expenditures for major health care services including inpatient hospital outpatient emergency physician office nursing home home health and hospice care and determined that these services cost a total of 865 billion and that 160 billion or 18 5 percent of this total was incurred by people with diabetes Per capita medical expenditures totaled 13 243 for people with diabetes and 2 560 for people without diabetes When differences in age sex and race ethnicity are adjusted for people with diabetes had medical expenditures that were 2 4 times higher than expenditures that would have been incurred by the same group if they had not had diabetes N 75 75 There are no known methods for preventing Type 1 diabetes Research studies have found that lifestyle changes such as altering diet increasing moderate physical activity and lowering body weight by 5 to 7 percent can prevent or delay the onset of Type 2 diabetes N 76 76 Studies have also shown that medications have been successful in preventing diabetes in some population groups Figure 4 Total Cost of Diabetes Figure 4 Source of data Ref 73 Once diagnosed effective management of diabetes is key to preventing its complications Controlling glucose blood pressure and blood lipids reduce health risks Preventive care can also reduce eye disease reduce the risk of amputation and allow for the early detection and treatment of diabetic related kidney disease The American Diabetes Association reports that people with diabetes who control their disease by keeping their blood sugar down cost employers only 24 a month compared with the 115 a month for people with diabetes who do not control their blood sugar N 77 77 Numerous studies have found that disease management programs have substantial benefits for people with diabetes in terms of improving health outcomes and the quality of life N 78 78 Particular interventions are associated with improved outcomes Screening and timely intervention with laser photocogulation reduces the incidence of severe vision loss as a consequence of diabetes and has been called cost effective According to a 1996 study the currently recommended screening and treatment for eye disease in persons with diabetes cost 1 757 per life year of sight saved or 3 190 per quality adjusted life year gained 1990 dollars N 79 79 Similarly yearly foot exams for high risk patients which have increased dramatically in the past decade reduce the risk of lower extremity amputation N 80 80 Health plans and providers are increasingly looking to disease management programs as a means for improving care and controlling costs The American Association of Health Plans reports that virtually all health plans now offer at least one disease management program N 81 81 Often these programs focus on diabetes For example Cor Solutions Medical a privately held disease management contractor works with diabetics primarily over the phone answering questions reminding them of routine medical appointments and helping patients manage their disease Its CEO states that its approach cuts the cost for caring for a diabetic by up to 20 percent per month while improving rates of diagnostic testing and annual foot exams Caterpillar The goals of Caterpillar s Healthy Balance Program include motivate positive change in modifiable health risk behaviors reduce health risks improve long term health status promote self efficacy and informed decision making reduce healthcare and related costs achieve exceptional participation via strong incentives The program has a high participation and retention rate 93 of incented employees and 62 of spouses Key features of the Healthy Balance Program include strong incentives top down management support spouses included continuous evaluation improvement Components of the program include both demand reduction and behavior change components low cost confidential health assessment personalized health education messages stratification low high risk periodic assessment based on risk individualized interventions targeted to health risks and readiness to change intensive high risk chronic condition interventions including disease management phone counseling serial tracking ongoing monitoring adjustment of interventions

with links to sites with scientifically validated information and ongoing evaluation of claims health assessments communication of summary results to employees Caterpillar predicts that the Healthy Balance Program will lead to long term savings of 700 million by 2015 To date the program has reduced the aggregate health risk score by 6 for the low risk population and 14 for high risk subjects This decline in aggregate risk represents improvement in major risk factors physical activity cigarette smoking stress fat and fiber consumption etc Participants who completed the high risk program reduced their doctor office visits by 17 and hospital days by 28 To contact Caterpillar for more detailed information see http www caterpillar com www caterpillar com Despite growing evidence that diabetes disease management programs result in improved health outcomes opportunities exist to improve the effectiveness of these interventions A disease management program typically is a bundle of services designed to improve the care delivered and compliance with recommended treatments and behaviors Because of the multi pronged approach it is challenging to disentangle the value of each component part of a disease management program N 82 82 In addition measurement issues are also challenging since diabetes is a disease whose natural progression is to worsen over time That said one study suggests a payback on investment within 33 months but calls for further study prior to major implementation N 83 83 Other studies are more cautious although they find substantial benefits in terms of health outcomes over time A 2003 study examined the business case for diabetes management programs in two managed care plans and quantified the health benefits for participants in a diabetes disease management program over 10 years at 31 000 per patient in terms of length and quality of life N 84 84 CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE Cardiovascular disease CVD is predominantly caused by atherosclerosis a hardening of the arteries due to a thickening of the lining of the arteries Atherosclerosis results in inadequate blood flow to particular tissues in the body causing poor function damage or death of those tissues In heart disease and stroke the principal components of CVD atherosclerosis affects the arteries of the heart and brain respectively CVD accounts for 40 percent of the mortality in the United States killing about 950 000 Americans annually N 85 85 Taken as a whole CVD is the cause of more deaths than the next five causes of death combined N 86 86 N 87 87 The Prevalence of Cardiovascular Disease Heart disease and stroke are the first and third leading causes of death in the United States respectively in both men and women The 2000 age adjusted death rate from CVD among the general population was 343 1 per 100 000 people N 88 88 Coronary heart disease CHD caused by blockage of the arteries supplying the heart is the single leading cause of death within the array of cardiovascular diseases This year an estimated 1 1 million Americans will have a new or recurrent coronary attack and more than 45 percent of the people experiencing these attacks will die of them The age adjusted 2000 death rate from coronary heart disease was about 186 9 per 100 000 for the total population N 89 89 Recent studies have demonstrated that the number of sudden deaths from heart disease among people aged 15 34 have increased from 2 719 in 1989 to 3 000 in 1996 N 90 90 It is commonly believed that CVD primarily affects men and older people However research shows that more than half of all CVD deaths each year occur among women A consideration of mortality alone understates the burden of CVD About 61 million Americans almost one fourth of the general population live with some form of CVD including coronary heart disease stroke high blood pressure congestive heart failure congenital heart defects and other diseases of the circulatory system N 91 91 Prevalence rates for CVD vary by race and ethnicity N 92 92 Heart disease also results in significant disability among working adults Stroke is a leading cause of serious long term disability that accounts for more than half of all patients hospitalized for a neurological disease Of the 4 5 million Americans who have had a stroke 1 million have been impaired by some form of long term disability Almost 6 million hospitalizations each year are due to CVD N 93 93 figure 5 Deaths from Cardiovascular Disease 1999 Figure 5 Source CDC Compressed Mortality Data Risk Factors for Cardiovascular Disease As discussed earlier untreated or poorly treated diabetes can result in cardiovascular disease In addition the CDC has identified five key risk factors for CVD tobacco use high cholesterol levels lack of physical activity poor nutrition and high blood pressure High blood pressure About 90 percent of middle aged Americans will develop high blood pressure in their lifetime and nearly 70 percent of people with high blood pressure do not have it under control Of the estimated 50 million Americans with high blood pressure 31 6 percent are unaware of their condition N 94 94 High cholesterol About 40 6 million Americans have cholesterol levels of 240 mg dL or above which is considered high risk Meanwhile a 10 percent decrease in cholesterol levels may result in an estimated 30 percent reduction in the incidence of coronary heart disease N 95 95 Tobacco use About 1 in 5 deaths from CVD are attributable to smoking Age adjusted prevalence rates for Americans 18 and older in 2000 show that 27 1 percent of men and 22 2 percent of women are smokers The World Health Organization estimates that one year after quitting the risk of coronary heart disease decreases by 50 percent and within 15 years the relative risk of dying from CHD for an ex smoker approaches that of a lifetime nonsmoker The risk of death from coronary heart disease increases by up to 30 percent among those exposed to environmental tobacco smoke at home or at work N 96 96 Poor diet leading to overweight and obesity Using BMI definitions more than 129 million adults are overweight or obese and 61 million are in the obese category of BMI N 97 97 In addition an estimated 5 million children are considered overweight N 98 98 Physical inactivity The relative risk of coronary heart disease associated with physical inactivity ranges from 1 5 to 2 4 an increase in risk comparable to that observed for high blood cholesterol high blood pressure or smoking N 99 99 The Costs of Cardiovascular Disease The costs of CVD have steadily increased past the 300 billion dollar mark over the past three years The first comprehensive economic analysis based on 2000 Census data performed by the National Heart Lung and Blood Institute NHLBI and the American Heart Association AHA estimated the total cost of the disease to be 298 2 billion for the year 2001 N 100 100 Subsequent updates to this analysis gave an estimated total cost of 329 2 billion for 2002 and 351 8 billion for 2003 N 101 101 N 102 102 figure 6 Total cost of Cardiovascular Disease Figure 6 Source of data Refs 100 101 102 The NHLBI AHA studies of CVD evaluated both direct costs physician services hospital and nursing home services medications home healthcare and other durables and indirect costs of lost productivity resulting from morbidity and mortality days of work lost due to absence from work or premature death For the year 2003 these cost categories totaled 209 3 billion and 142 5 billion respectively Direct medical care costs covered approximately 66 million physician office visits and 7 million outpatient department visits and over 4 million emergency department visits N 103 103 CVD ranks highest among all disease categories in hospital discharges Given the age effects of CVD it poses a substantial economic burden on Medicare in 1999 26 3 billion in payments were made to hospitals for Medicare beneficiaries expenses due to cardiovascular problems That was an average of 7 883 per discharge N 104 104 The indirect costs of CVD are also substantial most of these costs are due to lost productivity and are borne by employers According to the CDC if all forms of major CVD were eliminated life expectancy would rise by almost 7 years The same study indicates that the probability at birth of dying from major CVD is 47 percent While death rates from CVD have declined over the past ten years actual absolute deaths have increased over the same period of time N 105 105 Great strides have been made in the treatment of CVD but treatment can only be part of the solution An estimated 3 million Americans ages 35 64 who are currently free of coronary heart disease will develop the disease in the next ten years in the absence of intervention to reduce risk factors N 106 106 ASTHMA Asthma is an obstructive lung disease caused by an inflammatory reaction and hyperreactivity of the airways to various triggers Inflammation and bronchospasm of the airways restricts airflow into and out of the lungs Asthma is characterized by periodic attacks of wheezing shortness of breath chest tightness and coughing In sensitive individuals asthma symptoms can be triggered by inhaled allergens allergy triggers such as pet dander dust mites cockroach allergens molds or pollens Symptoms of asthma can also be triggered by respiratory Northeast Utilities The goal of Northeast Utilities WellAware program is to improve the health and well being of employees and families through participation in targeted

American population in terms of prevalence and the leading serious chronic illness of children in the U S The Prevalence of Asthma Three metrics are used to describe asthma prevalence Lifetime prevalence which indicates how many individuals in the population have been diagnosed with asthma at least once in his or her lifetime Current prevalence which indicates how many individuals in the population are currently diagnosed with asthma in a given year Attack prevalence which indicates how many individuals in the population have had an asthma attack in a given year The most recent data available from 2001 show a lifetime prevalence rate of 113 4 per 1000 persons for the overall United States population Approximately 22 2 23 2 million adults and 9 1 million children have been diagnosed with asthma at some point within their lifetime giving a composite estimate of about 31 3 32 3 million Americans who have had or currently have asthma Recently children ages 5 17 have displayed the highest lifetime prevalence rates in 2001 the lifetime prevalence rate was 144 2 per 1000 children Females have a 10 percent higher lifetime prevalence rate than males N 107 107 The current prevalence rate for 2001 the ratio of the U S population who actually had asthma during that year was estimated to be 73 4 per 1000 persons or about 20 3 million Americans The highest current prevalence was observed in those 5 17 years of age at a rate of 98 1 per 1000 persons The current prevalence rate in females at 82 6 per 1000 persons was 30 percent higher than that for males at 63 6 per 1000 persons This pattern was reversed in children the current asthma prevalence rate for boys was 30 percent higher than for girls ages 0 17 N 108 108 Prevalence of Asthma By Gender 2001 Age Gender Category Asthma Prevalence Rate 2001 per 1000 population Girls ages 0 17 74 4 Boys ages 0 17 99 0 All Females 82 6 All Males 63 6 Overall 73 4 Source Trends in Asthma Morbidity and Mortality American Lung Association Epidemiology Statistics Unit March 2003 Within the population suffering from asthma in 2001 approximately 12 million Americans had an asthma attack of this number about 4 million were children under 18 The overall asthma attack rate in the general population was 43 4 per 1000 persons in 2001 N 109 109 Reliable statistical data on asthma prevalence are available from the year 1980 forward From 1980 to 1996 the number of Americans afflicted with asthma doubled to 15 million with children under five years of age experiencing the highest rate of increase N 110 110 Children ages 5 17 have had the highest prevalence rates between 1997 and 2001 demonstrating that the asthma epidemic will continue to be a significant health problem for future generations N 111 111 The Costs of Asthma The costs of asthma have increased in step with the rise in asthma prevalence The first comprehensive economic evaluation of asthma in 1992 estimated the total cost of the disease to be 6 2 billion per year N 112 112 A study on the national costs of asthma for the year 1997 estimated those costs at 8 billion 11 billion N 113 113 The National Heart Lung and Blood Institute within the National Institutes of Health estimated that the annual costs of asthma were 11 3 billion per year in 1998 The two most recent analyses of the economic impact of asthma commissioned by the American Lung Association ALA to study asthma costs in 2000 and 2001 cited annual estimates of 12 7 billion and 14 billion respectively N 114 114 figure 7 Total Cost of Asthma Figure 7 Source of data NIH NHLB Refs 112 114 The ALA study of asthma costs in 2001 evaluated both direct health care costs of asthma hospital care physicians services and medications and indirect costs of lost productivity school days lost work days lost and lifetime earnings lost due to mortality In 2002 dollars these cost categories totaled 9 4 billion and 4 6 billion respectively Direct medical care costs covered approximately 465 000 hospitalizations 1 million hospital outpatient department visits 1 8 million emergency room visits and 10 4 million physician office visits due to asthma each year N 115 115 About 1 in 6 pediatric emergency room visits is caused by an asthma attack N 116 116 N 117 117 Indirect costs encompass about 14 million lost school days 14 5 million lost work days and the productivity loss of the approximately 5 000 people who die from asthma each year Asthma is the most common reason for school absence this specific indirect cost alone results in an estimated 1 billion annual productivity loss N 118 118 The financial burden of asthma is borne heavily by patients and their families Out of pocket expenses for asthma are estimated at roughly 25 percent of total medical costs compared to the average of 10 percent for medical expenses for all illnesses N 119 119 The average family in the U S spends between 5 5 percent and 14 5 percent of its total income on treating an asthmatic child N 120 120 However employers are not impervious to this cost burden Annual per capita employer expenditures for asthmatic patients were approximately 2 5 times those for control subjects 5 385 employee versus 2 121 employee For asthmatic employees wage replacement costs for workdays lost as a result of disability and absenteeism accounted for almost as much as did medical care 40 percent versus 43 percent N 121 121 As indicated above both prevalence and costs of asthma have increased markedly over the past decade and a half While there is no consensus as to why asthma prevalence has increased scientists studying the phenomenon have postulated that obesity and lack of physical exercise dietary changes and increased exposure to indoor allergens are among the reasons for the increase N 122 122 The growth in costs of asthma is largely due to the increase in asthma prevalence prevalence rates increased by nearly 70 percent from 1986 to 1996 far outpacing the 12 percent growth in population Average costs for asthma per capita actually decreased over this period despite the significant increase in absolute costs N 123 123 That is while treatments have become more cost effective total costs have still ballooned because of the greater proportion of the population with asthma This indicates that in order to contain asthma costs in the future better treatments must be supplemented with prevention strategies aimed at reducing asthma prevalence TOBACCO USE Efforts to promote smoking cessation have the potential to prevent substantial mortality and morbidity in this country Over the past several decades strong scientific evidence has emerged that smoking is addictive and has serious health consequences N 124 124 The Prevalence of Smoking Recent prevalence estimates indicate that over 46 million or approximately 23 5 percent of adults in this country are current smokers those who smoke every day or almost every day Smoking rates tend to be somewhat higher among males individuals between the ages of 18 and 44 and American Indians Among adolescents prevalence estimates are generally comparable to those of adults with approximately 28 5 percent of high school students reporting that they are current smokers N 125 125 Approximately 80 percent of adult smokers started smoking before the age of 18 According to the 2001 NHSDA 4 400 young people between the ages of 12 17 years try their first cigarette each day N 126 126 Despite these figures it is encouraging to note that the majority of smokers approximately 70 percent have made at least one prior attempt to quit smoking and between one third to one half of all smokers 34 to 46 percent attempt to quit each year However very few of these individuals approximately 2 5 percent actually succeed in quitting The high rate of relapse is largely attributable to the nicotine dependence that most smokers develop N 127 127 In fact over 85 percent of current smokers acknowledge that cigarettes are addictive N 128 128 The Effects of Smoking Prevalence of Smoking Figure 8 Source of data Refs 125 Tobacco use is the single most preventable risk factor for death and disease contributing to more than 440 000 premature deaths annually in the United States during 1995 through 1999 This figure represents one out of every five deaths each year being associated with tobacco use ranking tobacco use as the number one health problem contributing to death and disability in the U S Tobacco use is a risk factor for chronic lung disease heart disease stroke and several forms of cancer specifically cancer of the lungs larynx esophagus mouth and bladder N 129 129 N 130 130 Additionally research indicates that smoking contributes to cancer of the cervix pancreas and kidneys N 131 131 Shorter term effects of smoking include increased heart rate and blood pressure coughing with phlegm or blood shortness of breath when not exercising wheezing or gasping and reported poorer overall health N 132 132 The harmful effects of smoking do not appear limited only to those who use tobacco Pregnant women who smoke are more likely to produce low birth weight babies and infants with a variety of health disorders including those with an increased risk of death from sudden infant death syndrome and respiratory distress In addition an estimated 3 000 nonsmoking Americans die each year from lung cancer and up to 300 000 children have respiratory tract infections due to increased susceptibility after exposure to secondhand smoke N 133 133 An international analysis estimates that roughly half of all adolescents who try smoking will become life long smokers and of this group one in two will die as a result of smoking N 134 134 Unfortunately the mortality rates from smoking suggest that given the current prevalence of smoking among adolescents it can be expected that 6 4 million individuals under the age of 18 will die prematurely as a result of tobacco related diseases N 135 135 The Costs of Smoking The direct and indirect economic costs associated with tobacco use are significant According to the National Institute on Drug Abuse NIDA the direct and indirect costs of smoking are estimated at 138 billion per year N 136 136 As with other chronic conditions employers are significantly affected by the indirect costs of the health problems that result from tobacco use An extensive review of the literature published in 2001 found solid evidence that 6 to 14 percent of personal health care expenditures could be attributed to smoking and that smokers had greater medical costs over the course of their lifetimes The review also found a large number of studies that demonstrated that smokers are more costly to their employers than those employees who do not smoke N 137 137 The economic costs of smoking are estimated to be about 3 391 per smoker per year Each pack of cigarettes sold in the United States costs the nation an estimated 7 18 in medical care costs and lost productivity N 138 138 Roughly 14 percent of all Medicaid expenditures are for smoking related illnesses N 139 139 and more than 20 billion of Medicare expenditures each year are related to smoking N 140 140 Treatment and Prevention Efforts to promote smoking cessation have the potential to prevent substantial mortality and morbidity in the U S One year after quitting a person s additional risk of heart disease is reduced by half and after 15 years this risk equals that of a person who never smoked Within 10 years of quitting smoking a former smoker s risk of developing lung cancer is 30 to 50 percent below that of a current smoker The benefits are even greater for individuals who quit smoking before the age of 50 Their risk of dying in the next 15 years is half that of a person who smokes N 141 141 Tobacco dependence is a chronic condition that often requires repeated intervention However effective treatments do exist that can produce long term or even permanent abstinence Three types of counseling and behavioral therapies have been found to be especially effective in treating patients attempting tobacco cessation practical counseling problem solving skills training social support as part of treatment and help in securing social support outside of treatment N 142 142 A number of smoking cessation treatments currently exist including over the counter medications nicotine patches nicotine gum behavioral modification techniques self help efforts and prescription medications tablet inhalers nasal sprays A number of studies have examined the cost savings from tobacco prevention programs The State of California estimates that their statewide tobacco prevention program resulted in an overall cost savings of 8 4 billion from the years 1990 1998 This program included a statewide mass media campaign and community programs designed and implemented by local health departments community coalitions community based organizations and regional and statewide agency networks N 143 143 Over the course of the statewide program 3 62 in direct medical costs were avoided for every 1 spent on the program Reducing smoking prevalence among pregnant women by one percentage point over seven years would prevent 57 200 low birth weight deliveries and save 572 million Another study estimated that every 1 invested in certain types of school based tobacco prevention programs saves 19 90 in associated medical costs The economic benefits of prevention are also apparent for employers an economic assessment found that a health care plan s annual cost of covering treatment to help people quit smoking ranged from 0 89 to 4 92 per smoker whereas the annual cost of treating smoking related illness ranged from 6 00 to 33 00 per smoker N 144 144 BUSINESSES AND OTHER EMPLOYERS PROMOTING HEALTH AND DISEASE PREVENTION Employers have become increasingly aware that overweight and obesity lack of physical activity and smoking have a major impact not only on the health and productivity of their employees but also on the financial health of their businesses Since the 1970s many employers have provided a variety of health promotion and disease prevention programs to their employees These efforts often have focused on overweight and obesity physical activity and smoking as well as other behaviors and conditions such as depression and stress linked to the health and well being of their employees The motivation behind these programs is to improve the health status of employees increase the productivity and morale of employees and reduce absenteeism and reduce business costs that are associated with chronic diseases and disorders among employees Throughout this report a small number of noteworthy businesses health promotion and disease prevention programs along with their key features have been highlighted N 145 145 These particular companies have won national awards for their health programs and are presented in this report because they illustrate some of the promising approaches to promoting wellness among employees that many companies across the country are operating N 146 146 The proportion of employers who provide such programs has increased over the years and it is reported that health improvement programs of some kind now are being offered by over 80 percent of worksites with 50 or more employees and almost all large employers with more than 750 employees N 147 147 The focus and scope of these efforts vary substantially across companies Some worksite programs may focus on a single risk factor such as smoking or a particular disease such as CVD while others may focus on a much wider set of risk factors and diseases N 148 148 Employers offer a wide variety of resources that differ considerably in comprehensiveness intensity and duration and the extent to which they tie together health promotion and disease prevention activities with employee health benefits occupational health employee assistance programs disease management workers compensation disability benefits and other benefit programs N 149 149 Clearly small businesses face a much greater challenge in implementing practical affordable efforts to improve their employees health Future research and public policies will need to address the special needs of small employers One survey of more than 1 000 U S employers most of which had more than 1 000 employees found that 72 percent provided education or training on lifestyle behaviors to their employees and 40 percent offered financial incentives for participation in health appraisals or screenings N 150 150 Department of Labor data show that in 2000 18 percent of all employees including part time were eligible for wellness programs and 9 percent were eligible for fitness center programs N 151 151 Given the large number of companies that have implemented health promotion and disease prevention programs many for several decades now it is not surprising that a large amount of information has been reported on the effects of these programs on employee health and productivity and on the costs and benefits of these programs to the companies that sponsor them Moreover many companies and studies have reported that these kinds of programs have had positive effects on employee health and job performance and have resulted in cost savings for the companies that provide them The nature and quality of this information vary a great deal since these programs generally were not designed to be research studies Many of the available reports are case studies When more systematic studies are undertaken they often must address limitations that include selection bias skewed data confounding variables small sample sizes and lack of control or comparison groups N 152 152 These limitations in turn make it difficult for studies of worksite programs to attribute a causal relationship between the program and the measured effects and to generalize the findings to other locations businesses or workforces N 153 153 figure 9 Support for Healthy Lifestyles Among Large U S Employers 1999 Figure 9 Source of data Ref 150 A number of comprehensive reviews or meta analyses have analyzed findings across large numbers of individual studies of worksite health promotion and disease prevention programs in the recent years N 154 154 N 155 155 N 156 156 N 157 157 N 158 158 These and other reviews categorize and examine a broad array of worksite programs and provide in depth information and conclusions about many aspects of health promotion and disease prevention activities and their effects on employees and businesses While these reviews provide information that is too extensive and detailed to be adequately summarized in this brief discussion they provide a strong indication that many health promotion and disease prevention programs do work and do result in significant cost savings Many studies have focused specifically on the return on investment ROI from worksite health promotion and disease prevention programs One recent review identified well conducted rigorous evaluation studies of ROI then documented the range of ROI estimates in these studies and examined the factors that influenced program outcomes and ROI estimates N 159 159 Findings on the return on investment for health promotion and disease management programs were reported for nine employers Canada North America Life Chevron City of Mesa AZ General Mills General Motors Johnson Johnson Pacific Bell Procter Gamble and Tenneco These programs provide health education to their employees to promote behaviors that will improve health or prevent disease and typically include exercise programs health risk appraisal weight control nutrition information stress management disease screening and smoking cessation N 160 160 The review found significant return on investment for the programs provided by these nine employers with the range of benefit to cost ratios ranging from 1 49 to 4 91 in benefits per dollar spent on the program and a median of 3 14 For instance at the high end General Motors realized at one of their sites an annual savings of 105 50 in total health care costs per enrollee for an annual program cost of 27 per enrollee a ratio of 4 91 of benefits to cost These reviewers also examined what they call demand management programs or programs that encourage and help employees increase the use of self care and decrease their use of medical care often through self care books newsletters telephone information lines counseling and other means Looking at studies of ROI for demand management programs Blue Shield of California five California counties Group Health Rhode Island Group Health Association and United Health Care they found greater variation in the return on investment in these kinds of programs ranging from 2 19 to 13 in benefits per dollar spent They also examined three studies of ROI for disease management programs and found a range in benefit to cost ratios from 7 33 to 10 38 For multiple category programs that combined elements of these programs they found a range of 5 47 to 6 47 in benefits per dollar spent CIGNA The goal of CIGNA s Working Well Program is to keep its 34 000 U S employees healthy and at work The Working Well Program s annual budget is 2 5 million The program is implemented at all 250 domestic offices Working Well has a broad range of programs for all employees with special emphasis on issues of concern to women who make up 76 of CIGNA s employees The Working Well Moms Program encourages and supports breast feeding Over three quarters of CIGNA women are of childbearing age Breast feeding duration rates for participants are 72 at 6 months and 36 at 12 months significantly higher than control groups and U S data This has decreased pharmacy costs 62 fewer prescriptions for breast fed children The program has also contributed to decreased medical costs a savings of 240 000 in healthcare expenses In addition program participants have 74 fewer absences per 100 mothers a savings of 60 000 in lost time annually The Working Well Triumph Program provides skill training and support for disabled employees to improve their health adopt healthy lifestyles and reduce the likelihood of future disability leave This program has resulted in healthcare costs savings of more than 900 per program participant The Working Well Flu Shots Program provides free immunization inoculations at all significant employee locations The program is aimed at reducing workplace absenteeism Program participants has 29 less absenteeism as compared to employees not getting a shot This produced a savings of 33 per employee participant The overall return on investment for the program was 3 to 1 CIGNA s smoking cessation program which combines behavioral counseling and pharmacologic treatment is offered to all CIGNA employees and their benefits eligible family members who want to quit smoking The program helped 67 percent of its participants quit smoking after 12 months a quit rate up to three times higher than comparable smoking cessation programs CIGNA estimates saving 949 in health care costs for each successful participant a return on investment of 9 5 to 1 To contact CIGNA for more detailed information see http www Cigna com www Cigna com For these employers disease management programs resulted in the highest returns on investment and the educational health promotion and disease prevention programs the lowest returns Moreover the more expensive programs resulted in lower returns on investment than some of the less expensive ones The reviewers suggest the possibility that the higher costs may stem from the larger capital investments that go into on site fitness centers or classroom based education programs They also point out that the typical health promotion and disease prevention program provides health education to most or all employees but usually shows savings for only a small portion of the neediest employees whereas disease management programs are targeted on a smaller selected group of employees They conclude that in designing effective programs that will improve employee health and productivity and produce good returns on investment employers should consider an array of health and productivity programs rather than focus on the pure wellness program and integrate them with health and demand management or disease management activities N 161 161 Most of the information on the costs effects and benefits of corporate health promotion and disease prevention programs has come from studies of relatively short time periods e g two years or less Relatively little information is available on the long term effects of such programs on the health status of employees and their utilization of health care services and the return on investment over these longer periods One recent study examined the long term impact of the Johnson Johnson Health Wellness Program on medical care and expenditures N 162 162 Johnson Johnson has offered a health promotion program since 1979 and has spent several million dollars on evaluations of the program According to this study the Johnson Johnson program integrates employee health wellness disability management employee assistance and occupational medicine programs and places considerable emphasis on health promotion and disease prevention The study looked at up to five years of data and found that while there was a slight increase in emergency department expenditures per employee per year 10 87 there also were significant decreases in expenditures for outpatient and office visits 45 17 mental health visits 70 69 and inpatient hospital days 119 67 Across all of these categories total savings were 224 66 per employee per year Moreover the study found a substantial increase in savings in years 3 and 4 for outpatient and physician visits and inpatient days While these researchers caution that a variety of methodological limitations make it difficult to definitively establish causality for the observed effects and savings and to be certain about the exactness of the savings for each of the health outcome categories they suggest that a more in depth and comprehensive analysis would likely show that the total program savings were even greater and they conclude This study demonstrates that a well conceived health and wellness program that focuses on prevention self care risk factor reduction and disease management can produce substantial benefits for employers and their employees Utilization and expenditures may be reduced by better coordination of existing health and productivity management programs with many of these benefits occurring in later years N 163 163 CONCLUSION There is clear evidence that the costs of chronic conditions are enormous as are the potential savings from preventing them even if there may not always be agreement on the exact amounts of these costs and savings Since a large part of the root cause of chronic conditions involves attitudes and behavioral choices the prospect of reducing their prevalence appears daunting and promising at the same time Attitudes and behaviors may be resistant to change even when the desire to change is there Moreover people often encounter significant barriers in their social and physical environments On the other hand the actions that would eliminate much of the morbidity and mortality in our country are clear and to a large extent these are practicable measures that the average person can take By changing the way they live Americans could change their personal health status and the health landscape of the Nation dramatically Americans could save themselves their employers and the Nation substantial amounts of money if they took certain measures that are well understood and relatively modest in scope Even though some efforts over the last several decades to educate individuals about ways to improve their health and prevent disease have had limited influence on large proportions of our population others have been very successful Public and private policies need to focus on sustained efforts to encourage positive behaviors building on proven successful models Key to these efforts is the recognition that the worksite is a place that can be conducive to good health The stakes are so great that the challenge must be met It is ironic that in this day of high tech complex and costly medical procedures and treatments simple inexpensive easily understood actions such as increasing physical activity controlling weight and quitting smoking could have such a huge impact on the quality of life and the cost of health care While there always will be legitimate debate over the costs and benefits of particular health promotion and disease prevention endeavors the Nation simply cannot afford not to step up efforts to reverse the growing prevalence of chronic disorders Resources and energy need to be marshaled in all sectors and at all levels of society federal state tribal and local governments foundations associations health care providers and insurers businesses communities schools families and individuals to control and prevent the chronic conditions that threaten the Nation s physical and financial well being ENDNOTES and REFERENCES 1 Health Project website http healthproject stanford edu koop healthproject stanford edu koop Information presented in the report on notable employee wellness
