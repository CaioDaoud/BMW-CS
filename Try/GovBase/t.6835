Administration Post 9 11 Security Initiative June 2002 In the wake of September 11th the Federal Transit Administration FTA launched an aggressive five part security initiative to enhance the security of the nation s public transportation systems and help our public transportation agencies cope with these new threats To learn more about the FTA s efforts click on cgi bin exitpage go pl http www transit safety volpe dot gov www transit safety volpe dot gov Assessment Enhancing transit security must begin with an in depth professional assessment of the threats to and vulnerabilities of each transit system On December 17 2001 FTA began deploying expert security assessment teams to the 32 largest transit agencies The teams are using proven threat and vulnerability assessment methodologies to assess the security gaps in the agencies high consequence assets and make specific recommendations to reduce the risks to acceptable levels In addition the teams are assessing the agencies emergency response plans and the coordination of their emergency response efforts with associated fire police and other emergency response agencies The assessments are proving extremely beneficial for both the FTA and the transit agencies even at the most well prepared agencies The assessments are helping to identify best practices for the industry and will assist FTA in developing a road map for future programs Through the assessments we have learned that transit environments have many high risk high consequence assets Due to the challenge of protecting these assets in a transit environment that is inherently open it is more important than ever that agencies are able to respond as well as mitigate the impact of emergencies Planning Effective response to an act of terrorism requires instantaneous and sound decision making in a volatile high pressure environment Our largest transit operations already have emergency response plans but need to reexamine their plans in light of today s potential threats FTA is deploying Technical Assistance Teams to provide hands on assistance to transit agencies as they develop and refine their emergency response plans in light of their security assessment findings and heightened terrorist threats These plans will serve as blueprints for action in the wake of an attack They articulate the steps to take in order to notify authorities of the incident evacuate passengers protect personnel and equipment activate a unified command and communications system among transit police fire and emergency medical units and restore the system to normal This approach was successfully used to develop emergency response procedures and deliver on site training programs to Utah Transit Authority employees in preparation for the Winter Olympics Testing In the lessons learned from the tragic events of September 11th New York and Washington transit officials have emphasized how important it was that they had conducted regular emergency drills In addition to having an emergency response plan in place they recommend that every transit agency conduct regular emergency drills not just fire drills to keep skills sharp update response plans and build personal relationships with counterparts in the police fire and emergency medical response organizations FTA has recently sent a Dear Colleague Letter to the top 100 agencies to make them aware of grants available in amounts up to 50 000 for organizing and conducting emergency preparedness drills Again these funds will enable transit agencies to coordinate response with local and regional emergency personnel Training It is imperative that we have a transit workforce that understands security issues and is fully prepared to respond should an emergency occur To meet this need FTA is launching the Connecting Communities Emergency Preparedness and Security Regional Forums The forums kicked off in May in Orlando Florida and will continue in 16 additional cities across the country Forum registration is being offered at no charge The forums are designed to bring together small to mid size transit agency management and security personnel police and fire personnel responsible for emergency management coordination emergency medical services and hospital disaster relief coordinators and state and local government emergency management coordinators Participants will gain a better understanding of the roles played by each agency and begin the process of developing the plans tools and relationships necessary to respond effectively in an emergency situation In addition FTA is working with the Transportation Safety Institute TSI and the National Transit Institute NTI to expand current course offerings to a broader audience FTA in conjunction with NTI have launched an aggressive nationwide schedule to deliver comprehensive security awareness courses targeted to front line transit employees and supervisors These courses and the accompanying materials are available to transit organizations free of charge The practices put forth will help a transit system harden the target relative to terrorism as well as improve its overall security Technology The last component of our security initiative involves technology and research First 2 million of FY 2002 research funding will be used to fund security related transit research under the auspices of the Transit Cooperative Research Program of the National Academies of Sciences In addition FTA has reprioritized the FY 2002 budget to devote funds to improve the Transit Safety and Security Reporting Module of the National Transit Database and to implement the recently developed Bus Safety Program We have also received 4 0 to accelerate the implementation of the Project PROTECT chemical detection system which is being prototyped in the Washington D C subway system In order to assist all systems in the near term however FTA has issued guidelines for the handling of chemical and biological incidents in a subway environment FTA Navigational Links library bksp htm Bookshop other Links to Other Sites cgi bin exitpage go pl cgi bin exitpage go pl cgi bin exitpage go pl http search bts gov fta Search
