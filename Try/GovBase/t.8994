written and oral examination with a two part written examination The Board is currently promulating regulation to implement a two part written examination which will consist of the Standard current Written examination and a Written Clinical Vignette examination This impacts both Licensed Clinical Social Workers LCSWs and Marriage and Family Therapists MFTs with a written test consisting of clinical vignettes The purpose of the LCSW and MFT examinations are to ensure public safety by licensing only those who demonstrate the knowledge skills and ability to independently provide safe and effective services to the public The examinations are based on an occupational analysis that identifies the job related critical skills necessary for safe and effective practice The examinations are developed and evaluated by licensed MFTs and LCSWs who work under the guidance of the Department of Consumer Affairs Office of Examination Resources OER In 1998 the Board was the target of legislation SB 288 which would have eliminated the oral examination for LCSWs After this legislation was narrowly defeated the Board began to consider other options to the oral examinations In January 2002 the Board held a public hearing to solicit comments regarding the oral examination In April 2002 the Board received a presentation from the OER regarding written clinical vignettes The Board decided to include the clinical vignettes on the next examination version to begin gathering performance statistics Clinical vignettes consist of a vignette and a series of questions related to the vignette The possible answers are longer and more complex than a standard multiple choice item and list a sequence of actions or describe a process of applying knowledge For a sample LCSW clinical vignette go to
