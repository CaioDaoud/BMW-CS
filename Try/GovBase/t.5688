USGS Coral Mortality and African Dust Why have coral reefs that are bathed in clear oceanic waters throughout much of the Caribbean suffered algal infestation coral diseases and near extinction of herbivorous sea urchins almost simultaneously during the 1970s 1980s and early 1990s The best known factors detrimental to coral reefs include sewage run off from land dredging UV light etc These factors do not apply for many affected reefs where human population is low Is there an alternative way to spread nutrients and diseases Trent H Faust USGS coral dust africa florida caribbean diadema urchin algae black band remote sensing el nino environmental change satellite image SeaWiFS USGS U S Geological Survey Center for Coastal Geology Atmospheric transport of dust from North Africa to the western Atlantic Ocean region may be responsible for a number of environmental hazards including the demise of Caribbean corals red tides amphibian diseases increased occurrence of asthma in humans and decrease of oxygen eutrophication in estuaries Outbreaks of other unexplained environmental changes also might be attributable to the influx of African dust Studies of satellite images suggest that hundreds of millions of tons of dust are transported across the Atlantic Ocean at high altitudes from the expanding Sahara Desert to the Caribbean Sea and southeastern United States 19980101

exacerbated in the 1970s and 1980s and then began to decline in the 1990s Is it circumstance that coral reef declines occurred during the same period as desertification Various peaks in the dust record at Barbados and elsewhere in the western Atlantic Prospero and Nees 1986 coincide with benchmark events on reefs throughout the Caribbean courtesy of Prospero 1997 with known coral reef perturbations Hypothesis The hypothesis proposed here is that many coral reef events algae html algal infestation white band and blackband html black band disease sea fan disease diadema html sea urchin die off and possibly mass bleaching html coral bleaching are somehow related to dust from north Africa Mortality Events events html Black band disease see the events that have affected Caribbean corals events html Significant Mortality Events That Saharan dust is deposited in the western Atlantic is demonstrated by the following The barbados html record from Barbados and elsewhere Red iron and clay rich soils on carbonate islands throughout the Caribbean that are known to be of Saharan dust origin Muhs et al 1990 The Amazon rain forest in South America derives essential nutrients mainly phosphate from Saharan dust Swap et al 1992 The mechanisms by which dust may affect reefs include direct fertilization of benthic algae by iron or other nutrients interacting with NH4 and NO2 NO3 rich submarine ground water and by broadcasting of bacterial viral and fungal spores Example The fungus affecting sea fans throughout the Caribbean has been identified as a land based Aspergillus sp a fungus that does not reproduce in sea water Smith et al 1996 Conclusion Dust may be a viable explanation for the plight of coral reefs throughout the Caribbean The hypothesis is in need of verification Printable Open File Report pdf html OFR pdf html African Dust Carries Microbes Across the Ocean Are They Affecting Human and Ecosystem Health USGS Open File Report 03 028 Project
