the National Assessment of Educational Progress NAEP The Nation s Report Card Reading and Mathematics 2003 November 13 2003 Today the Center is presenting data drawn from the Highlights Reports for the 2003 Reading and Mathematics Assessments of the National Assessment of Educational Progress or NAEP These assessments were conducted earlier this year in all 50 states in nationsreportcard reading results2003 reading and nationsreportcard mathematics results2003 mathematics in the fourth and eighth grades The District of Columbia and the school systems operated by the Department of Defense for domestic and overseas personnel also participated a total of 53 jurisdictions more than have participated in any previous assessment Features of the nationsreportcard reading results2003 2003 NAEP Reading Assessment Content Students who took the assessment read complete texts appropriate to their grade The texts reflected the three purposes of reading Reading for literary experience reading to gain information and reading to perform a task Both grades were assessed on the first two purposes while only eighth graders were assessed on reading to perform a task All students responded to a combination of multiple choice and written answer questions For example one written answer question asked eighth grade students to comment on a story by Langston Hughes Thank You Ma am a reading for literary experience selection The accompanying sample answer received the highest rating because it showed a thoughtful understanding of the theme of the story and supported the interpretation with specific reference to story events that reflected the theme Assessment Years The 2003 Reading Assessment is the sixth assessment in a series that began in 1992 NCES assessed reading in both 2002 and 2003 In the future NCES will assess reading every two years Results Reported from the Assessment The NAEP Reading results are presented on a 0 500 point scale On the accompanying table and figures an asterisk denotes a statistically significant or measurable difference from 2003 Beginning in 2002 NCES started adding together all of the state samples to create the NAEP national sample providing much larger samples than in the past For this reason NCES is now able to detect smaller statistically significant differences National Reading Scale Score Results Across Years In the display of national results across years the dotted lines indicate assessment results when accommodations for special needs students were not allowed Special needs students are students with disabilities and those who are limited English proficient While large percentages of special needs students have always participated in NAEP in 1998 NCES began evaluations to determine whether it could permit accommodations in the NAEP assessments that would increase participation without affecting the validity of the assessments Based on those evaluations now all NAEP assessments allow accommodations for students who require them to participate In 1998 and 2000 NCES used dual samples both no accommodations and accommodations permitted providing two sets of results with light blue numerals for the no accommodations sample scores and black numerals for the accommodations permitted scores The overall fourth grade average score of 218 in 2003 was not measurably different from the average recorded in 1992 or in 2002 There was an increase for the accommodations permitted sample since 1998 the year when accommodations were first allowed As in 2002 the 2003 eighth grade average score of 263 for reading was higher than in 1992 However it shows a decrease of one point from 2002 Reading Scale Score Percentiles National percentile scores show where changes in scores are occurring Only one fourth grade percentile the 75th had a higher score in 2003 than in 1992 In contrast all eighth grade percentiles except the 90th showed a higher score in 2003 than in 1992 Comparing 2003 to 2002 students in the 10th and 25th percentiles showed lower scores Percentage Of Students By Reading Achievement Levels The National Assessment Governing Board has established reading achievement levels of Basic Proficient and Advanced for the fourth and eighth grades At the fourth grade the percentage at or above Proficient was higher in 2003 than in 1992 At the eighth grade the percentages of students at or above Basic and at or above Proficient were higher in 2003 than in 1992 Gaps in Average Reading Scale Scores Across Years By Gender Reading scores for male and female students in the fourth and eighth grades did not show many changes across the years However there were persistent gaps in performance In 2003 fourth grade females had an average score that was 7 points higher than fourth grade males and eighth grade females had an average score that was 11 points higher than eighth grade males The 2003 score gaps do not show a change when compared to the gaps in either 1992 or 2002 Gaps in Average Reading Scale Scores Across Years Comparing White and Black Students Student performance for fourth grade reading shows improvement for Whites Blacks and Asians from 1992 to 2003 However the average scores for Hispanics in 1992 and 2003 do not show a change On the other hand the percent of Hispanics increased from 7 to 17 percent over the same period Thus overall scores did not change for the fourth grade Despite the improvement in Black student performance at both the fourth and eighth grades White students scores were about 30 points higher than Black students scores This gap did not change significantly from 1992 to 2003 at either grade Gaps in Average Reading Scale Scores Across Years Comparing White and Hispanic Students At both the fourth and eighth grades White students scores were about 27 points higher than Hispanic students scores This gap did not change significantly from 1992 to 2003 at either grade Average Reading Scale Scores Across Years By Eligibility for Free Reduced Price School Lunch Looking at scores on the basis of eligibility for free reduced price school lunch is useful because it gives us a picture of the performance of students from lower income families as compared to students from families with average and above average incomes Students whose families have an income below 185 percent of the poverty line are eligible for free or reduced price school lunches Non eligible students come from families with average or above average incomes NCES first collected these data for the reading assessment in 1998 Students from lower income families have lower scores than students from higher income families In 2003 both eligible and non eligible fourth grade students had a higher average score than in 1998 Among eighth graders neither showed a change from 1998 while eligible students showed a decrease from 2002 Gaps between the scores for non eligible and eligible students show no change from 1998 for either grade In addition the fourth grade gap did not show a change from 2002 but the eighth grade gap did an increase from 22 to 25 points 1992 vs 2003 Average Reading Scale Scores for States and Jurisdictions Grade 4 Of the 42 states and jurisdictions that participated in both the 1992 and 2003 fourth grade reading assessments 13 showed increases in average scores 5 showed declines and 24 did not show a measurable difference 1998 vs 2003 Average Reading Scale Scores for States and Jurisdictions Grade 8 Eighth grade state level comparisons can only be made as far back as 1998 Of the 39 states and jurisdictions that participated in both 2003 and 1998 8 showed increases 7 showed decreases and 24 did not show a measurable difference Features of the nationsreportcard mathematics results2003 2003 NAEP Mathematics Assessment Content The mathematics assessment has five content strands Some of the questions require students to use such devices as protractors and calculators Like the reading assessment students answered a combination of multiple choice and written answer questions One sample multiple choice question asked of fourth graders The perimeter of a square is 36 inches What is the length of one side of the square And the answer is 9 inches Assessment Years This is the fifth national mathematics assessment since 1990 Mathematics like Reading is reported on a scale of 0 500 as well as by percentages of students at the various achievement levels National Mathematics Scale Score Results Across Years The fourth grade average score of 235 in 2003 was higher than in 1990 and in all other assessment years The same is true of the 2003 eighth grade average of 278 Mathematics Scale Score Percentiles Percentile scores for the fourth grade showed increases at all five levels For each percentile the 2003 performance score was at least as high as it was for students in the next higher percentile category in 1990 For example we see that in 2003 students at the 25th percentile had an average score of 216 comparable to the average score of 214 posted by students at the 50th percentile in 1990 At the eighth grade the 2003 average score for each percentile was higher than in 1990 or any other previous assessment but the increases were not quite comparable to those for the fourth grade For example in 2003 eighth grade students at the 10th percentile had an average score of 230 9 points below the average score of 239 recorded by students at the 25th percentile in 1990 Percentage Of Students By Mathematics Achievement Levels Achievement level percentages also showed improvement At the fourth grade the percentage of students at or above Basic increased from 50 percent in 1990 to 77 percent in 2003 while the percentage at or above Proficient increased from 13 percent to 32 percent At the eighth grade the increases are from 52 percent to 68 percent and from 15 percent to 29 percent Average Mathematics Scale Scores Across Years By Gender Scale scores in mathematics by gender show increased scores The differences between males and females though measurable were not large At the fourth grade the average male score was three points higher than the female average in 2003 and at the eighth grade one point higher Average Mathematics Scale Scores Across Years By Race Ethnicity White Students Scores for White students at both the fourth and eighth grades were higher in 2003 than in 1990 and any other previous assessment year This is true for Black and Hispanic students as well Average Mathematics Scale Scores Across Years By Race Ethnicity Black Students Scores for Black students also show increases in 2003 The average score for fourth grade Black students increased by 28 points from 1990 to 2003 and the average for eighth grade Black students increased by 15 points Average Mathematics Scale Scores Across Years By Race Ethnicity Hispanic Students Scores for Hispanic students showed improvements as well in 2003 The average score for Hispanic fourth graders increased by 22 points from 1990 to 2003 and the average for Hispanic eighth graders increased by 13 points Gaps in Average Mathematics Scale Scores for Whites and Blacks and Whites and Hispanics Comparing White and Black students the fourth grade gap though large is smaller in 2003 than in either 1990 or 2000 At the eighth grade the 2003 gap does not show a difference when compared to 1990 but is smaller than in 2000 Comparisons of White and Hispanic scores show fewer changes The fourth grade gap in 2003 shows no difference from 1990 but is smaller than in 2000 The eighth grade shows no changes 1992 vs 2003 Mathematics Average Scale Scores for States and Jurisdictions Grade 4 All 42 states and jurisdictions that participated in both the 1992 and 2003 assessments had higher scores in 2003 than in 1992 Comparing 2003 results to 2000 we would have the same basic picture every participating state and jurisdiction recorded an increase 1990 vs 2003 Mathematics Average Scale Scores for States and Jurisdictions Grade 8 The eighth grade map comparing 2003 with 1990 has the same picture as well Each of the 38 states and jurisdictions that participated in both assessments shows an increase Comparing 2003 scores with scores from the 2000 assessment would show that 28 of 42 states and jurisdictions recorded an increase and none recorded a decline Conclusion There is much more information included in these two Highlights In addition much more detailed information is available for these two assessments through the NAEP web site NCES would like to thank the states the students the teachers and the schools whose cooperation made these assessments the largest in NAEP s history Because of their efforts the NAEP reading and mathematics assessments have results for every state in the nation Complete results for The Nation s Report Card Reading and Mathematics 2003 nationsreportcard reading results2003 Reading and nationsreportcard mathematics
