the DEA employees and corporate guests who have contributed to the Survivors Benefit Fund making it possible for him to receive the financial assistance to pursue his dream of becoming a prosecuting attorney Enrique s very moving remarks recalled how at the young age of 11 his father asked him to promise not to become a DEA Agent because of the danger involved with the job Kiki explained how becoming a prosecuting attorney has allowed him to keep his promise to his father but maintain contact with members of the DEA family and serve society in an honorable way As Kiki reminded the audience his father Enrique Camarena Sr was the definition of patriotism honor and integrity One of the guests at the dinner was so moved by Enriques remarks that he called the following morning and donated an additional 5 000 00 to the DEA Survivors Benefit Fund The generosity shown by the guests was overwhelming and proceeds from the dinner auction and contributions are expected to provide the Survivors Benefit Fund with nearly 150 000 in financial support The DEA Survivors Benefit Fund Board of Directors would especially like to thank Peter and Elaine Schweitzer and Michael Browner for their tireless support and efforts on behalf of the DEA Survivors Benefit Fund since it s creation in 1997 Because of their efforts and the efforts of many more the Survivors Benefit Fund has been able to distribute over 750 000 in financial support to DEA employees and their families and erected memorials that assure that our heroes are Never to be Forgotten www dea gov
