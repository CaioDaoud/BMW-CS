describe the rationale behind and progress to date of a comprehensive study to examine the spinal fluid of Alzheimer s patients during the course of their illness compared to healthy patients The research study also involves an extended view of a special group of normal subjects perceived to be at risk for developing Alzheimer s disease The hope is to isolate specific biological traits which may aid in the early identification of the disease top Back to Top mfp logo Preparing for SARS or Smallpox or Whatever Comes Next Responding to Emerging Infectious Diseases and Bioterrorism Threats The world has recently seen an emergence or reemergence of infectious diseases such as smallpox SARS West Nile virus and monkeypox What is the public perception of these diseases How are they spread Are we prepared if they occur close to home How will hospital workers be protected bios03 henderson html Dr Henderson will cover these issues and how the Clinical Center has responded to new diseases in the past He will also address new technologies controlling the airborne transmission of disease top Back to Top mfp logo Sickle Cell Anemia Moving from Pain to Cure Sickle cell disease is one of the most common inherited blood disorders in the United States Scientists have learned a great deal about the medical condition during the past 30 years what causes it how it affects the patient and treatments that do or don t work Understanding the disease and its warning signs aids researchers working to unravel the mysteries of sickle cell bios03 gladwin html Dr Gladwin will cover those topics and related ongoing clinical research Current investigations include efforts to understand the role of lung complications in adults with sickle cell disease and evaluating the role of current and future therapies in sickle cell disease treatment top Back to Top mfp logo Stem Cell Transplantation Promise in Cancer Treatments and Blood Disorders Bone marrow transplantation has been in clinical use for more than 30 years The bone marrow contains stem cells that give rise to the blood components including white blood cells red blood cells and platelets Today bone marrow transplantation is more commonly referred to as stem cell transplantation as stem cells can be obtained from several other sources other than the bone marrow including the peripheral blood and umbilical cord blood Stem cell transplantation is commonly used for a variety of malignant disorders such as leukemias and lymphomas However it is also used for a number of other diseases such as immune deficiency states and non malignant blood disorders bios03 bishop html Dr Bishop will discuss current research efforts that focus on increasing the application of stem cell transplantation to a broader patient population by increasing the potential stem cell donor pool decreasing transplant related toxicities and investigating its use in diseases not commonly treated with stem cell transplantation top Back to Top mfp
