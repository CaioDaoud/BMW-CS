Service Traffic Management Conformance Test Tool This software kit is intended to provide a tool for ATM product developers and ATM test equipment designers who need to construct test facilities for standard conformance testing of ABR service rate control implementations The protocol that is the target of this effort is provided in the Available Bit Rate ABR rate control scheme specified in section 5 10 of the ATM Forum Traffic Management TM Specification V4 0 This implementation tool provides the user with an environment for executing all of the conformance test cases proposed by NIST to the ATM Forum for ABR rate control ATM Forum 97 0034 tools abrtest prd abrtest html ABR Testlogo tools abrtest prd atm sim html ATM HFC Simulator The provides a means for researchers and network planners to analyze the behavior of ATM networks and or HFC networks without the expense of building a real network The simulator is intended to be a planning tool for network operators and a protocol analysis tool for researchers For ATM networks the simulator implements the AAL ATM and physical layers for Hybrid Fiber coax networks the simulator implements IEEE 802 14 and Society of Cable TV Engineering SCTE Cable TV modem protocols The simulator includes simulated applications using TCP IP or native ATM interfaces and it contains a rich set of traffic models including self similar traffic and MPEG 2 compressed video streams tools abrtest prd atm sim html ATM Simulator tools abrtest prd aprops html ATM Network Routing Protocol PNNI Performance Simulator The PNNI Simulator allows
