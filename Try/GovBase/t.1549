growth The goal here is not to provide every possible link to every comet related home page I believe that the links given below are a good sampling of what is available In some cases I have linked to excellent lists of links You should be able to find whatever comet page you are looking for through these links The Central Bureau for Astronomical Telegrams CBAT For rapid notification of comet and other astronomical discoveries it is always best to go to the source http cfa www harvard edu cfa ps cbat html CBAT CBAT issues the IAU Circulars IAUCs and runs an on line computer service There is lots of information free of charge on comets and minor planets Other services are provided to subscribers only but information about the services can be obtained via this link You can also get information about the Minor Planet Center MPC If you are a serious comet observer this is your most important source of information The International Comet Quarterly ICQ and the Comet Handbook The
