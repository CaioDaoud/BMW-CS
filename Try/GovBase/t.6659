specialize in geologic mapping landslide hazards analysis geophysics terrain modeling and analysis paleontology and Geographic Information Systems GIS Through an understanding of the complex geology of the San Francisco Bay region the Project seeks to assess geologic hazards such as landslides earthquake causing fault zones and soil liquefaction due to ground shaking Visit the http sfgeo wr usgs

multibeam Rock Pinnacles on the Floor of SF Bay that Pose a Hazard to Navigation Multibeam Data in San Francisco Bay With spectacular imagery and perspective views of the SF Bayfloor learn about the hazards that big ships and barges face in navigating San Francisco Bay and what might be done to help This Web page series is based on the USGS Open File Report OFR Multibeam Data and Socio Economic Issues in West Central San Francisco Bay USGS OFR 98 139 The high resolution multibeam swath mapping system used here is a hull mounted sonar array that collects bathymetric soundings with a series of beams and records the absolute amount of sound reflected back to the array The data products are highly detailed bathymetric maps and backscatter images respectively A sample of the bathymetric data is shown to the left http walrus wr usgs gov elnino SMCO coast erosion 1982 83 El Ni o Coastal Erosion San Mateo County California Heavy surf and rains severely eroded beaches and fragile sea cliffs

have been conducting beach surveys and monitoring changes in coastal morphology since early October 1997 Up to 4 meters of vertical beach loss was measured on several Monterey Bay beaches between October and mid February and many beaches were completely submerged during high tides Historical structures that had been buried since 1983 such as wharf pilings old seawalls and trolley car trestles became emergent on several Monterey Bay beaches http wrgis wr usgs gov open file of97 745 San Francisco Bay Region Landslide Folio USGS has released a full slate of maps and interpretations useful to officials and the public for assessing potential landslide and debris flow hazards during the current El Ni o climatic conditions These maps were created by integrating information on topography landslides and rainfall thresholds together with data from the National Weather Service and the State Office of Emergency Services The data are available for the entire region as well as by county The San Francisco Bay Region Landslide Folio comprises six separate but related reports These reports as well as sample maps are now available http walrus wr usgs gov elnino landslides sfbay Potential San Francisco Bay Landslides During El Ni o USGS produced special landslide hazard maps of the San Francisco Bay Area for the California State Office of Emergency Services OES and the National Weather Service NWS in anticipation of the 1997 98 El Ni o Season The landslide maps identify areas where the greatest threat to life and property exists from the movement of deep seated landslides Check out

move or think you do confirmation is a click away A new rapid earthquake location service by USGS and UC Berkeley separates the quakes from the large trucks and produces a very preliminary magnitude and location of significant quakes in northern California Preliminary data will be updated as more information becomes available and seismologists on call are able to interpret the readings Links from here lead to lots of other new earthquake information provided by USGS http www abag ca gov bayarea eqmaps pickcity html ABAG USGS Earthquake Hazard Maps USGS geophysist John Boatwright is the co
