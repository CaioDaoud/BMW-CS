Laura Bush a former school teacher told members of the Senate last year that the development of early language and pre reading skills is not only extraordinarily critical to a child s reading ability and academic success throughout school as well as his or her occupational success throughout life The absence of this development has the potential to destroy self esteem confidence and motivation to learn In April of 2002 President Bush announced a new initiative to improve early childhood education for millions of America s youngest children The President s initiative aims to Strengthen Head Start to improve the quality of experiences for young children including training the nearly 50 000 Head Start teachers in the latest and best techniques Ensure that pre school programs are more closely coordinated with state K 12 education goals and Improve the information available to parents and caregivers about the best practices in early childhood development including an unprecedented 45 million research effort to identify effective early literacy programs and practices The Head Start program is scheduled for reauthorization in the 108th Congress and congressional Republicans want to use the opportunity to strengthen the program s academic components to improve results for young children Press Statements http 143 231 252 66 press press108 11nov headstart112503 htm House Senate
