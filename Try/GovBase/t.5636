Federal government has a long history of promoting conservation by recycling extending at least as far back as World War II with the War Production Board s call to Americans to save scrap metal The last three decades however have seen an increased attention to promoting energy conservation and recycling across America as well as within the Federal government Key Events In 1976 Congress passed and President Gerald Ford signed the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act Section 6002 requires agencies to develop affirmative procurement programs to purchase EPA designated recycled content products The Federal buy recycled program is intended to create and sustain markets for materials recycled in our home and office recycling programs as well as industrial by products that otherwise would be landfilled In 1991 President George Bush issued Executive Order 12780 Federal Agency Recycling and the Council on Federal Recycling and Procurement Policy This order created the Federal Recycling Coordinator designated by the EPA Administrator the Council on Federal Recycling and Procurement Policy and agency recycling coordinators within each of the major agencies all in order to increase the level of recycling and purchase of recycled content products President Bill Clinton s 1993 Executive Order 12873 Federal Acquisition Waste Prevention and Recycling created the position of the Federal Environmental Executive designated by the President as well as Agency Environmental Executives These positions were specifically intended to bolster support for recycling and the procurement of recycled content products This order also set the standard that all federal office paper is to contain at least 30 percent post consumer recycled content President Clinton named Fran McPoland as the first Federal Environmental Executive In 1998 President Clinton issued Executive Order 13101 Greening the Government Through Waste Prevention Recycling and Federal Acquisition which built on the prior orders and also created the White House Task Force on Waste Prevention and Recycling The Present OFEE s new mission statement is Promoting sustainable environmental stewardship
