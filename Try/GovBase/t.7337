http uscode house gov uscode cgi fastweb exe getdoc uscview t05t08 26 1 28 29 20 20AND 20 28 285 29 20ADJ 20USC 29 3ACITE 20AND 20 28USC 20w 2F10 20 28552 29 29 3ACITE 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 5 U S C 552 that provides access to federal agency records except to the extent that such records or portions thereof are protected from disclosure by any of the nine exemptions and three special law enforcement record exclusions in the act The FOIA is not a means by which to obtain answers to questions It applies only to requests for agency records and only records in existence at the time of the FOIA request foia htm Top Who may file a FOIA request Anyone can submit a FOIA request including U S citizens partnerships corporations associations state governments and foreign nationals or governments The statute excludes federal agencies from the definition of a person who can request records under the act Requests for records from fugitives from justice or from an agency acting on behalf of a fugitive also are not covered by the act foia htm Top How do I make a FOIA request to OSC Your request must be in writing Telephone calls will not be accepted or handled as FOIA requests You should address your letter to FOIA PA Officer Office of Special Counsel Legal Counsel and Policy Division 1730 M St N W Suite 201 Washington DC 20036 4505 Your letter and envelope should clearly be marked FOIA Request You may also send your request by facsimile to 202 653 5161 foia htm Top Are there records I can get without a FOIA request Yes You can obtain OSC annual reports publications press releases and forms directly through our Web site You can also request a copy of OSC regulations and the agency staff directory directly from OSC without filing a FOIA request foia htm Top How long will it take to process my FOIA request All federal agencies are expected by law to respond to a FOIA request within 20 business days stating whether the records requested or portions thereof will be released However many federal agencies including OSC have backlogs of FOIA requests OSC s FOIA Officer generally acknowledges requests as soon as they are received in the agency s Legal Counsel and Policy Division Requests are usually processed in order of their receipt OSC uses a multi track processing system for responding to FOIA requests Multi track processing is a system in which simple requests requiring relatively minimal review such as requests for copies of correspondence previously exchanged between the requestor and OSC or for minimal information that is easily retrievable are placed in one processing track More complex requests such as those requesting entire contents of files and requiring more substantive review are placed in another track Requests in each track are processed on a first in first out basis There are certain steps you can take to assist OSC in responding more quickly to your request Make sure you are as specific as possible in requesting the information you seek If your request is very broad e g you are asking for documents over a period of years etc you may want to reduce the scope of the request Referencing specific case and report numbers is also helpful in expediting a response to your request Whenever possible include the date title or name author or subject matter of the record you are requesting The more specific you are the more likely OSC will be able to locate the records you seek foia htm Top What types of information may be withheld from me OSC is an independent federal investigative and prosecutorial agency Its primary mission is to protect federal employees from prohibited personnel practices especially reprisal for whistleblowing As such the contents of OSC case files other than copies of materials exchanged between first party requesters and the OSC are generally subject to withholding under FOIA Most records or portions of records are withheld on the basis of three of the FOIA s nine exemptions Exemption b 2 which exempts from disclosure information related solely to the internal personnel rules and practices of an agency http uscode house gov uscode cgi fastweb exe getdoc uscview

includes information covered by the attorney work product and deliberative process privileges Martin v Office of Special Counsel 819 F 2d 1181 D C Cir 1987 The contents of OSC case files are frequently covered by either or both the attorney work product privilege and the deliberative process privilege Many materials in complaint files are attorney work product This is because when someone files a complaint with OSC alleging a possible violation of law information is compiled by staff for the use of our attorneys in anticipation of possible litigation to obtain correction disciplinary action for any violations Records made for that purpose continue to be protected regardless of the passage of time or status of the case OSC complaint files also contain memoranda notes and other documents prepared by complaint examiners investigators and attorneys reflecting their preliminary decision making on the allegations under review Such records are protected from disclosure under the deliberative process privilege of exemption b 5 Records in OSC files subject to withholding under exemption b 5 include complaints examiner notes summaries of interviews and recommendations investigator notes summaries of interviews investigative reports or summaries prosecution recommendations and tapes or transcripts of interviews Exemption b 7 protects information compiled for law enforcement purposes that could reasonably be expected to interfere with enforcement proceedings http uscode house gov uscode cgi fastweb exe getdoc uscview t05t08 26 1 28 29 20 20AND 20 28 285 29
