Losses from Fires Washington DC The United States Fire Administration USFA released a report today that outlines an agreement between the administration and national fire protection professionals advocating the use of fire suppression and sprinkler systems The report titled National Residential Fire Sprinkler Initiative outlines specific national strategies that might reduce the number of deaths due to home fires each year In particular the report draws attention to the aspect of localized fire suppression in high risk areas of the home and residential sprinklers in buildings supported by the federal government We know how important residential sprinkler systems are said U S Fire Administrator R David Paulison Every year more than 3 000 people lose their lives in home fires and most of those deaths are among the elderly the disabled the low income and the very young Sprinkler systems are one way to reduce that number and to save the lives of community residents served by the nation s fire service The specific national strategies resulting from this meeting are to Develop an aggressive strategy for advocating sprinklers in residential buildings influenced or supported by the federal government Advocate localized sprinkler systems as a means of fire suppression in high risk areas e g kitchens for retrofit applications Provide advocacy and informational support among stakeholders including state and local decision makers and Ensure that the USFA continues to support research and development in residential fire sprinkler technology Related to these strategies several tasks were identified by the group and will be considered for future programs including conducting additional national level meetings and forming two coalition groups of partners One would be a federal group to effect proposed changes in federally subsidized leased and owned residential units and the other an allied professional group to address the differences between sprinkler advocates and adversaries Download small PDF icon download jsp url downloads pdf nrfsi 03report pdf National Residential Fire Sprinkler Initiative PDF Format 345 Kb small Word icon download jsp url downloads
