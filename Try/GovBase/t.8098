GENETICS OF BEEF TENDERNESS The Biological Basis of Meat Tenderness and Potential Genetic Approaches for its Control and Prediction M Koohmaraie USDA ARS U S Meat Animal Research Center Clay Center NE 68933 Introduction Inconsistency in beef tenderness at the consumer level has been identified as one of the major problems facing the beef industry Solving this problem has been made one of the top concerns of the meat industry Some have argued that eating satisfaction results from desirable flavor juiciness and tenderness combined and thus argue that we should study all three components We recognize that palatability consists of these components and that it is a combination of these eating attributes that determines the degree of eating satisfaction However at the U S Meat Animal Research Center we have determined that our research efforts should be focused on meat tenderness because 1 consumers consider tenderness to be the single most important component of meat quality Miller 1992 2 consumers can discern between tenderness levels and are willing to pay a premium for tender meat Boleman et al 1995 3 the coefficient of variation for sensory tenderness is twice that of juiciness and flavor FIG01 html Figure 1 Koohmaraie et al 1994 Shackelford et al 1995 Wheeler et al 1995a and 4 Savell and Shackelford 1992 provided several lines of evidence indicating that beef subprimals and retail cuts are priced according to their expected tenderness The higher palatability of a tenderloin steak relative to a round steak is due to higher tenderness and not juiciness or flavor In fact among 10 major beef muscles tenderloin which is the most highly valued cut of beef was one of the least juicy and least flavorful cuts Shackelford et al 1995 Thus inadequate or inconsistent beef tenderness is the most likely cause of consumer dissatisfaction and improvement in tenderness would result in higher product value Inconsistency in meat tenderness is due to a combination of our inability to routinely produce tender meat and perhaps more importantly our inability to identify carcasses producing tough meat and classify them accordingly To solve this problem we must develop methodologies for tenderness based classification of beef The beef industry relies on the USDA quality grading system to segment carcasses into groups based on varying levels of expected meat palatability However numerous investigations of the relationship between marbling and beef palatability have shown that although there is a positive relationship between marbling degree and tenderness this relationship is weak at best reviewed by Parrish 1974 Wheeler et al 1994a reported that marbling explained about 5 of the variation in palatability traits and that there was both tough and tender meat within each marbling degree Thus there are far too many carcasses with tender meat that are discounted and far too many with tough meat that are not discounted under the current USDA quality grading system Wheeler et al 1994a Any new classification system should be based on meat tenderness itself or direct predictor s of tenderness Should it become necessary to use predictors of meat tenderness the predictor s should explain most of the observed variation in meat tenderness as opposed to the current system in which marbling explains only 5 of the variation in beef tenderness The objectives of this manuscript are to briefly discuss the biological basis for meat tenderness and to discuss potential genetic approaches for controlling and predicting the observed variation in meat tenderness The Biological Basis of Meat Tenderness Our years of observation have indicated that there is a rather large amount of variation in extent of tenderization shear force after 1 day of postmortem storage FIG02 html Figure 2 as an example which was the earliest time we had measured shear force We had indications that these differences were created during the first 24 hr postmortem Koohmaraie et al 1987 and suggested that all animals probably had the same tenderness level when slaughtered To test this hypothesis we conducted an experiment to determine the at death shear force value of lamb in the absence of muscle shortening Wheeler and Koohmaraie 1994 At the time of slaughter longissimus muscle has intermediate shear force In the next several hours i e rigor development there is a large decrease in sarcomere length from 2 24 to 1 69 m which is associated with a large from 5 07 to 8 66 kg increase in shear force i e toughness An opposite phenomenon i e tenderization also begins either at slaughter or shortly after slaughter which results from weakening of the myofibrils caused by proteolysis of proteins responsible for maintaining structural integrity of the myofibrils FIG03 html Figure 3 Wheeler and Koohmaraie 1994 Thus we demonstrated that there are minor inherent differences in meat tenderness at the time of slaughter and that indeed the observed differences in 1 day shear force are generated during the first 24 hr post slaughter Thus there are some animals that go through the tenderization process rapidly and could be consumed after 1 day whereas others could be consumed after 3 7 or 14 days and still others would not be acceptable even after extended postmortem storage FIG02 html Figure 2 I have suggested that differences in the rate and extent of postmortem tenderization are the cause of variation observed in meat tenderness after postmortem storage FIG02 html Figure 2 Koohmaraie 1992a b 1994 The development of a method of predicting meat tenderness requires a sound knowledge of the mechanisms that regulate meat tenderness Since the turn of the century mechanisms of postmortem meat tenderization have been the subject of many studies and many laboratories have contributed to our collective knowledge for review see Goll et al 1983 1991 Koohmaraie 1988 1992a b 1994 Koohmaraie et al 1994 Ouali 1990 1992 Robson et al 1991 Current evidence suggests that calpain mediated proteolysis of key myofibrillar proteins is responsible for improvement in meat tenderness during postmortem storage of carcasses or cuts of meat at refrigerated temperatures These proteins more than likely not all have been identified are involved in inter e g desmin and vinculin and intra myofibril linkages e g titin nebulin and possibly troponin T Although the list of the proteins involved could change over the years I believe that the principle will stand the test of time that is proteolysis of key myofibrillar proteins proteins whose function is to maintain structural integrity of myofibrils is responsible for postmortem tenderization As new proteins are discovered e g fulcin Terasaki et al 1995 their potential role in postmortem tenderization will systematically be determined If the differences in the rate and extent of proteolysis of these specific proteins account for differences in the rate and the extent of tenderization then the variation in the tenderness of meat at the consumer level could be controlled by controlling these events There is much evidence to support the above hypothesis i e differences in postmortem proteolysis are responsible for meat tenderization some of which includes 1 dietary administration of some beta adrenergic agonists to lamb and beef such as L644 969 and cimaterol for review see Koohmaraie et al 1991a reduces tenderization and proteolysis 2 infusion of carcasses with calcium chloride accelerates enhances both tenderization and proteolysis Koohmaraie et al 1988 and zinc chloride prevents postmortem proteolysis and tenderization Koohmaraie 1990 3 animals that do not go through postmortem proteolysis also do not go through tenderization Koohmaraie et al 1995a Taylor et al 1995 Some of our strategies on the development of methods to predict meat tenderness are based on these biochemical processes and are summarized elsewhere Koohmaraie et al 1994 1995d Genetic Approaches to Predicting Meat Tenderness Many scientists and producers have suggested that controlling the genetics of the slaughter cattle population would entirely solve the beef industry s tenderness problem I agree that genetics makes a significant contribution to the total variation in tenderness as tenderness varies among and within breeds FIG04 html Figure 4 Wheeler et al 1995a However analyses indicate that genetic and environmental factors make about an equal contribution to variation in tenderness The best estimates indicate that within a single breed genetics controls about 30 of the variation in beef tenderness This 30 represents the heritability additive gene effects of tenderness Koch et al 1982 within a breed Therefore within a breed 70 of the variation is explained by environmental and non additive gene effects Between breed variation is about equal to or less than variation within breeds Therefore among cattle of all breeds approximately 46 of the variation in tenderness is genetic and 54 is environmental Thus significant improvement in tenderness can be made by controlling those factors responsible for the environmental effects such as time on feed high energy diet stress carcass chilling postmortem aging time FIG02 html Figure 2 cooking method and end point temperature as well as through selection of breeds or genetic selection within breed Traditional animal breeding theory indicates that within a breed the most effective genetic selection is made through progeny testing Progeny testing would not be a practical method to improve tenderness due to the time and expense required to develop and evaluate progeny The rate of genetic improvement in a given trait is a function of the heritability of the trait the generation interval and the selection differential If we make the following assumptions use 13 sires hold inbreeding to less than 1 100 cow herd size heritability estimates of 0 30 for shear force and 0 42 for marbling the genetic correlation 0 25 between shear force and marbling Koch et al 1982 and the references therein standard deviation of 1 0 kg for shear force then it would take 12 0 years or 40 7 years to improve shear force by 1 0 kg by selection for shear force or for marbling respectively If we increase the size of the cow herd to 500 the above estimates would be 6 8 and 23 1 years respectively Obviously a significant change in the above parameters will affect these estimates There is evidence to suggest that significant improvement in shear force measurement can be made Koohmaraie et al 1995c Wheeler et al 1994b Wheeler et al 1995b to improve its accuracy which may change the heritability estimate for shear force and thus the time required to make improvement through selection No doubt focusing on the genetic components of meat tenderness through selection and progeny testing is a long term approach to the problem and we should focus our immediate attention on other factors i e time on feed stress postmortem aging time cooking method and end point temperature to reduce the variation in meat tenderness at the consumer level This does not mean and should not be interpreted to mean that the genetic contributions to tenderness are not important The major impact that genetics can have on meat tenderness is well documented For example it is well known that the mean shear force value and its standard deviation increases as the percentage of Bos indicus inheritance increases FIG05 html Figure 5 Crouse et al 1989 Another good example is the case of the callipyge phenotype in sheep The callipyge condition is a recently identified phenotype in lamb which has a major effect on carcass composition by increasing total muscle weight by approximately 30 However carrier lambs produce meat that has extremely high longissimus muscle shear force value 248 of control even after 21 days of postmortem storage FIG06 html Figure 6 Koohmaraie et al 1995a b Thus the application of molecular genetic approaches could hasten our ability to control the genetic aspects of meat tenderness The genetic contribution to tenderness or any other trait can be evaluated by using the candidate gene approach and or a whole genome approach With the current capabilities these two approaches are not mutually exclusive and thus can be pursued simultaneously Candidate gene approach The candidate gene approach takes advantage of the existing knowledge of the biochemical basis of meat tenderness As stated current data indicate that calpain mediated proteolysis of key myofibrillar proteins is responsible for postmortem tenderization thus differences in the potential proteolytic activity of the calpain system result in differences in the rate and extent of postmortem tenderization We have collected evidence indicating that within a species 24 hr rather than at death calpastatin activity is related to meat tenderness In beef for example calpastatin activity at 24 hr postmortem is highly related to beef tenderness after 14 days of postmortem storage for review see Koohmaraie et al 1995d Among all species at death calpastatin activity is highly related to meat tenderness Koohmaraie et al 1991b Ouali and Talment 1990 In some special circumstances at death calpastatin is also related to tenderness of meat within a species such as dietary administration of some beta adrenergic agonists such as L644 969 and cimaterol for review see Koohmaraie et al 1991a and expression of callipyge gene in lamb Koohmaraie et al 1995a b The estimates for the relationship between calpastatin activity and meat tenderness vary but up to 40 of the variation in beef tenderness is explained by calpastatin activity at 1 day postmortem Koohmaraie et al 1995d Such a high degree of association could be the justification for using calpastatin in a candidate gene approach for predicting meat tenderness The drawbacks to the candidate gene approach are twofold Undoubtedly more than one gene is involved in regulation of tenderness and this approach only allows for examination of one gene at a time Secondly the factors affecting the expression of the gene of interest e g calpastatin could be located on an entirely different chromosome thus such regulatory factors could not be identified in a candidate gene approach Genome mapping Perhaps the best approach for determining the genetic controls of beef tenderness and more importantly utilizing such information is to use the genome mapping approach Genetic maps are rapidly being constructed as a basis for identification of markers associated with Quantitative Trait Loci QTLs for use in Marker Assisted Selection MAS in cattle breeding programs About 1000 markers spaced evenly throughout the cattle genome have been identified sequenced and used to trace the inheritance of DNA segments from parent to offspring in cattle families designed for development of a linkage map Bishop et al 1994 A linkage map characterizing heterozygous well spaced markers enables efficient selection of markers for identification of QTLs segregating in cattle resource populations Resource populations are well defined large families of animals having traceable heritage through pedigree analysis and segregating alleles of genes affecting phenotypic characteristics of interest i e meat tenderness carcass retail yield etc These resource populations may be derived from within breed breed crosses or interspecies crosses However the type of resource population used or constructed will influence the level of heterozygosity within parental genomes Several hundred more markers must be available for parental screening for a within breed such as Angus or Hereford search of QTLs than for an interspecies cross such as Brahman x Angus search due to the lower level of marker heterozygosity in the purebred genome Depending on the objectives for use of the marker information resource populations must either be created in a research setting or identified in the field from cattle populations currently in production Strategies for identifying loci affecting economically important traits in the examples cited above have relied on the concept of whole genome linkage scanning FIG07 html Figure 7 Andersson et al 1994 This concept is contrary to the candidate gene approach in that it allows at the DNA level an assessment of genetic variation at multiple intervals simultaneously with phenotypic records across all regions of the genome flanked with markers Because of their ease of use high utility and high throughput microsatellites are the current marker of choice in whole genome linkage scanning Microsatellites allow rapid efficient dissection of a plant or animal genome into interval parts for determining their direct contribution to variation in quantitative and disease related traits A method of searching for markers involves the use of a large number of half sibs from interspecies backcrosses involving only a few sire families To discover what region s of the genome is contributing to meat tenderness phenotypic observations on tenderness i e shear force will be collected and associated with variation at the DNA level Once found markers for meat tenderness can be implemented in various MAS schemes However these tenderness associated markers may only be useful for MAS in the reference population in which they were identified In order for such information to be useful for other populations the region s of the genome that are contributing to variation in meat tenderness must be sequenced positional cloning to determine the identity of the gene in this region s This information can then be used for MAS in all populations Experiments are already underway at the MARC to identify markers for beef tenderness and other traits however it is important to recognize that even with the genes regulating tenderness at hand not all the variation in meat tenderness can be controlled The reason is that tenderness is a trait that is highly affected by factors other than additive genetics For example a steak could be very tough or tender depending on the time postmortem it was cooked degree of doneness etc For this reason a comprehensive approach is needed to consistently provide consumers with an acceptable product The approach would include the use of the best genetics along with sound management during growth slaughter and processing I believe that even after all these factors are controlled there could be a significant percentage of animals that would still produce tough meat These are the carcasses that do not tenderize with postmortem storage We must develop methodologies to identify these carcasses and then process them differently Our approaches toward controlling meat tenderness variation and development of an objective method for predicting meat tenderness are described in detail elsewhere Koohmaraie et al 1994 1995d
