SVS Site Requirements svs icons gradient blue ico 930 At any particular time the Scientific Visualization Studio SVS is involved in providing visualization products systems and expertise to various NASA projects and missions Our current activities include but are not limited to the following Earth Science Enterprise ESE Informal Education Computational Technologies CT Program Earth and Space Science Project Global Learning and Observations to Benefit the Environment GLOBE Earth Today Digital Earth Missions like The Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission TRMM The Mars Orbiting Laser Altimeter

are created at NTSC video resolution and frame rate 720 pixels wide by 480 pixels high by 29 97 frames per second However video pixels are not square but are taller than they are wide so the animations are meant to be viewed at a 4 to 3 aspect or about 640 pixels wide by 480 pixels high Most animations are not yet available on this site in their full video resolution We are currently evaluating technical alternatives for the electronic distribution of full resolution video The SVS does not fulfill requests for copies of the tapes in our library On some of our animation pages there is a direct link to a video distribution service from which tapes including some of our animations may be ordered General information on this service can be found http pao gsfc nasa gov indepth gtv ordering html here Preview Animations Each animation page contains the entire animation in reduced resolution MPEG 1 format Why MPEG 1 We needed to use a format with common viewers available for UNIX Macintosh and Windows systems This format had to have a high level of compression and still have enough resolution to show the animation clearly MPEG 1 satisfies these requirements There are two types of MPEG 1 formats used Many animations are digitized from the original video tapes at a resolution of 352 pixels wide by 240 pixels high by 29 97 frames per second Once again these pixels are not square and the animations should be viewed at a 4 to 3 aspect or 320 pixels wide by 240 pixels high A compliant MPEG viewer should handle this aspect change transparently Some of our more recent animations are digitized from the original animation frames and use square pixels at a resolution of 320 pixels wide by 240 pixels high by 29 97 frames per second Here are links to some of the more common MPEG 1 viewers we know about redirects www apple com quicktime exitnotice html QuickTime Windows Macintosh redirects www sgi com tech faq audio bundled html movieplayer exitnotice html Movieplayer SGI redirects www microsoft com windows windowsmedia download default asp exitnotice html Windows Media Player Windows Macintosh Some animation pages also have QuickTime preview versions which can be viewed with the QuickTime viewer referenced here High Definition Animations Some of our animations are also included in a high definition MPEG 2 format As a rule these animations are either 1920 x 1080 x 30 frames sec or 1280 x 720 x 30 frames sec and cannot be played without specialized hardware decoders These animations are provided for specialized uses such as museum displays or live presentations Here are links to several of the decoders for these formats redirects www visualcircuits com prod serv HD cfm exitnotice html Visual Circuits HDfocus redirects www electrosonic com high res asp exitnotice html Electrosonic HD Video Server Images Our animation pages usually display one or more small images in JPEG format that illustrate the content of the animation Larger images are called print resolution images and are provided in TIFF format for downloading Print resolution stills often have a size of 2560 pixels wide by 1920 pixels high which is about 8 5 inches by 6 5 inches when printed at 300 dots per inch Warning There is a generic problem with some TIFF files in that they can get reversed top to bottom if the display software is not completely compliant with TIFF specifications If you want to use a TIFF image from our site please check that the image is being displayed correctly in your application possibly by checking it with the smaller JPEG version of the image on our website Story Pages Our site also contains story pages pages created to support NASA media releases which included material created in the SVS Usually these pages link directly to the animation pages supporting the story End Content Area End Content Area
