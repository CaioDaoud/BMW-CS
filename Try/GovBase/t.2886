Brokers E Newsletter Agents Brokers Advisory Committees In July 2001 Commissioner Mike Kreidler appointed a cross section of agents and brokers throughout the state to serve on an Agents and Brokers Advisory Committee There are now two advisory boards one comprised of agents and brokers specializing in property and casualty and the other of agents and brokers engaged in marketing life and disability products Both committees usually meet on a semi annual basis However the combined Agents and Brokers Advisory Committees met jointly on Sept 8 2003 in Tumwater Once the minutes are approved they will be posted below The Commissioner elected to hold a joint meeting for several reasons Many insurance issues cut across the traditional L D and P C lines Example medical liability insurance and its impact on access to health care through networks and other delivery systems A chance to discuss together the committee structures and membership The OIC has received numerous requests from producers around the state seeking to serve on the committees and we wanted to discuss with current committee members how we can best restructure the committees to continue the participation of representatives of important stakeholder groups as well as accommodate interested producers from around the state Items to consider included committee sizes composition position rotation and staggered terms We wanted the members of both committees to hear precisely the same message about the agency s current plans for possible legislation during the next session Agenda items included a discussion on liability insurance markets and legislative responses and licensing initiatives and process improvements Property and Casualty Committee Roster P C Reps Betty Baker Bellevue Robert D Bush CPCU
