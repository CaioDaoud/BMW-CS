resource management and climate change A sound monitoring and assessment capability is essential to provide knowledge of system integrity under varying degrees of environmental stress Resource management is improved by a thorough knowledge of the health of the ecosystem and the rates at which various attributes are changing Understanding ecological processes requires long term study Only through monitoring of physical chemical and biological processes can patterns and periodicity of rare events begin to emerge and unacceptable changes in the environment be detected Monitoring at multiple spatial and temporal scales is an essential component of GLERL s overall research program res Backgrnds lmback html more general background information on GLERL Integrated Long term

products relevant to the coastal environment Satellite and in situ data and products are received and or developed at eight regional CoastWatch nodes throughout the coastal United States and Great Lakes and are distributed via the Internet to Federal state and local agencies and academic institutions for environmental monitoring management and supporting research CoastWatch directly supports
