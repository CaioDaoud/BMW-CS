The U S Congress and the NASA Administrator have emphasized the need to transfer NASA developed technology and expertise to U S industry to increase U S industrial competitiveness create jobs and improve the balance of trade Emphasis is being placed both on transfer of technology for mission application with the aerospace industry and for dual use applications with non aerospace industries As part of the Space Act of 1958 NASA is tasked with transferring its technology the knowledge and other ideas gained while performing research and development in support of space flight to the private sector including industry academia research organizations and private entrepreneurs Q Will MSFC conduct research to help a company solve technical problems or improve products A If MSFC has technology available that would be useful to the company employees would be pleased to discuss its applications to the company s need Under a Space Act Agreement a joint development effort could be conducted if MSFC has interest in the research Q What services are available to assist companies with technology transfer A MSFC has partnered with http www rti org technology Research Triangle Institute RTI for the purpose of facilitating communication between MSFC inventors and companies In addition NASA established a http nctn hq nasa gov Commercial Technology Network NCTN to assist companies interested in commercializing NASA technologies This network includes the Regional Technology Transfer Centers and the National Technology Transfer Center Available Technologies Q Where can I find information on new NASA technologies A NASA publishes formal technical reports describing research work conducted at NASA facilities In addition there are several online sites to access information about transferable technology http www nasasolutions com http www nasasolutions com http www nasatech com NASA Tech Briefs http technology nasa gov NASA Techfinder http nctn hq nasa gov Commercial Technology Network Q Whom do I contact to receive further information on a particular MSFC technology A Contact the contact html Technology Transfer Program Q Is there a listing of MSFC patents and patent applications that are available for licensing A Yes Some information is available availpat html online and a full listing is available from http techtran msfc nasa gov working patent html Patent Counsel Space Act Agreements Q How is a Space Act Agreement different from a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement A They are essentially the same The National Aeronautics and Space Act of 1958 authorizes NASA to work cooperatively with industry The Technology Innovation Act authorized other government research organizations which did not have similar provisions in their charters to use CRADAs NASA continues to use the Space Act authority because it provides more flexibility than the Innovation Act Q Can costs and or resources be shared under a Space Act Agreement A Yes In certain cases there is the potential for MSFC to leverage resources All resources are negotiated by MSFC Q Who receives patent rights to technologies developed under a Space Act Agreement A The company will receive the rights if all of the inventors are employed by the company MSFC will receive the rights if only NASA employees invent the item A jointly owned patent will result if both company and NASA employees invent the item In any event patent rights will be specified in the Space Act Agreement and negotiated in accordance with applicable law s Small Business Programs Small Business Innovative Research Small Business Technology Transfer SBIR STTR Q Do you have to have won a Phase I award in order to be considered for Phase II of a project A Yes you must have a phase I contract in order to submit a phase II proposal and be eligible for an award Q When can a company have contact with the technical points of contact at NASA A A company can have contact with technical personnel at NASA regarding the technical content of the topics subtopics at anytime EXCEPT during the solicitation period The time of the open solicitation is a black out period Q Are foreign based firms eligible for SBIR awards A No To be eligible for award of SBIR funding agreements a small business concern has to meet the following qualifications be independently owned and operated principal place of business is located in the United States at least 51 percent owned or in the case of a publicly owned business at least 51 of its voting stock is owned by United States citizens lawfully admitted permanent resident aliens Q May a portion of an SBIR award be subcontracted A For Phase I a minimum of two thirds of the research and or analytical effort must be performed by the proposing firm and for Phase II a minimum of one half of the research and or analytical effort must be performed by the proposing firm Q If we develop technology and decide NOT to exercise our rights to a patent is that technology then published and if so how and to whom A A contractor has the first option to elect to retain title to a subject invention and pursue patent protection To the extent authorized by 35 U S C 205 the Government will not disclose publish the invention to the public for a reasonable time in order for a patent application to be filed by the contractor Time periods are specified in the contract If the contractor does not elect to retain title the Government has the option to pursue patent protection Any publication of the invention before a patent application has been filed will establish a statutory bar to patenting requiring the filing of a patent application before the one year statutory time period has expired If neither the contractor nor the Government is interested in pursuing patent protection either party may pursue publication NASA routinely publishes new innovations in NASA TechBriefs as well as making them electronically available over the Internet For more information see FAR 52 227 11 Patent Rights Retention by the Contractor Short Form as Modified by NASA FAR Supplement 18 52 227 11 Q If an innovation is created under an SBIR the small company owns the intellectual property What rights does the government have to the intellectual property Can they give the technology to and have someone else build it for them or build the device themselves and not pay royalties Has this ever happened and how do we guard against it A With respect to any subject invention an SBIR contractor has the first option to retain title and file for patent protection The Federal Government shall have a nonexclusive nontransferable irrevocable paid up license to practice or have practiced for or on behalf of the United States the subject invention throughout the world A subject invention means any invention of the contractor conceived or first actually reduced to practice in the performance of work under the contract Thus the Federal Government has the right to build the subject invention itself or have a contractor build it for them and not pay royalties to the SBIR contractor These rights are established by statute For more information see FAR 52 227 11 Patent Rights Retention by the Contractor Short Form as Modified by NASA FAR Supplement 18 52 227 11 Q Can the SBIR pay for the patent costs A Contractors must pay their own patent costs for subject inventions in which they retain title Patent Licenses Q Can MSFC grant exclusivity for a particular technology A Exclusive rights to a technology can be licensed depending on how many companies are interested and on the company s license application Other factors taken into account are the company s commercialization plan and a demonstrated ability to successfully complete a commercialization effort Q What if another company is interested in the same technology that my company wants to commercialize A There are a number of possible licensing agreements nonexclusive co exclusive exclusive exclusive in a particular field of use or geographic region and various combinations of these MSFC requires interested companies to submit a commercialization plan for the particular technology MSFC uses these plans to determine which licensing arrangement will best ensure successful commercialization of the technology Q How long does the patent licensing process take What will it cost in up front money A The process takes about 3 to 4 months after receipt of the license application and commercialization plan This includes a mandatory waiting period of 2 months for exclusive licenses during which time a member of the public can file a written objection Down payments generally are set according to the value of the technology and are negotiable Q What percentage in royalties does MSFC require under a licensing agreement A The percentage in royalties to be paid to MSFC in a licensing agreement is negotiable and varies according to the type of license issued i e exclusive or nonexclusive and a number of other factors Privacy Issues Q Are discussions with MSFC personnel kept confidential What about the Freedom of Information Act FOIA A MSFC
