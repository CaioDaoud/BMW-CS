LLNL s mission to be a premier applied science national security laboratory Our primary mission is to ensure that the nation s nuclear weapons remain safe secure and reliable and to prevent the spread and use of weapons of mass destruction worldwide The mission of the CMS directorate is to enable the Laboratory to accomplish its primary objectives through excellence in the chemical and materials sciences Our vision is to be seen as the premier provider of scientific leadership that meets and anticipates the needs of the Laboratory while at the same time being recognized as a national leader in the chemical and materials sciences Our outstanding workforce is organized in divisions that support the following overarching themes Materials properties and performance under extreme conditions

Rubia As Associate Director for the Chemistry and Materials Science Directorate I would like to welcome you to our home on the Internet The site features our scientific and technical accomplishments In our Featured Science to the right we introduce highlights of some of the most exciting projects we are currently working on while more in depth information showing the breadth and depth of the science we do can be found under Research Areas and under About CMS by organization Tomas Diaz de la Rubia CMS Associate Director Featured Science Metal Nanoparticle Formation in Ordered Carbons Figure 1 Prior to carbonization this metal loaded gel shows the opalescence caused by diffracted light within the ordered void structure Periodic macroporous solids are currently being investigated for a range of applications including catalysis separations photonic crystals and nanoelectronics A common method for preparing three dimensionally 3D ordered macroporous solids uses close packed arrays of monodisperse spheres as templates In this approach the interstitial regions of these colloidal crystals are infused with a reaction solution of the material that will eventually comprise the replicate structure Once the composite has formed the template is then removed either chemically or thermally yielding the macroporous replicate solid with periodic voids in the 0 1 1 m size range A variety of macroporous materials have been prepared by this method including silica metal oxides metals carbon and polymers A promising extension of the template approach toward ordered porous materials of higher complexity is the development of methods that allows one to tailor composition and porosity of the wall structure defining the macropores Such an advance will be extremely important in the design of new ordered macroporous materials for catalysis separations and sensor applications http www cms llnl gov s t metal nanoparticle html More about this topic http www cms llnl
