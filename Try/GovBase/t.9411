period 1850 1950 mercury was mined and refined at several major deposits in California s Coast Ranges and the resulting quicksilver was used extensively in gold processing operations throughout California A large amount of mercury was used in gold processing estimated at 26 000 000 pounds and a large proportion of it several million pounds was lost to the environment Consumption of mercury contaminated fish is a possible risk to human health and to ecosystems Ongoing studies are designed to assess the levels of mercury contamination and bioaccumulation associated with historical gold and mercury mines in several watersheds in northern California Mercury hot spots are being identified for possible remediation in the http ca water usgs gov mercury bear yuba Bear Yuba watersheds and the http ca water usgs gov mercury trinity Trinity River watershed in cooperation with Federal land management agencies Bureau of Land Management and USDA Forest Service http www nasites com pam yuba Reservoirs downstream of historical mining activities are being characterized with regard to mercury contamination levels in biota water and sediment USGS scientists are working closely with other federal state and local agencies to determine whether reductions in mercury loads will be an effective way to reduce mercury concentrations in fish in the Sacramento River watershed and the Bay Delta issues 6 html Aquifer Storage and Recovery Aquifer storage and recovery ASR is a water resources management technique for actively storing water underground for recovery and use when needed Conjunctive use and artificial recharge are closely related management practices and the terms are sometimes used interchangeably Conjunctive use is a combination of practices to make the best use of surface water during wet periods and ground water during dry periods but does not necessarily imply active water storage practices used in ASR Artificial recharge AR is actively moving water into ground water systems AR can be seen as the storage part of aquifer storage and recovery issues 3 html California Ground Water The Water Resources Division of the U S Geological Survey in cooperation with Federal State and local water agencies obtains a large amount of data pertaining to the ground water resources of California each water year These data constitute a valuable data base for developing an improved understanding of the water resources of the State Beginning with the 1985 water year and continuing through 1993 these data were published in a report series entitled Water Resources Data for California Volume 5 Ground Water Data Prior to the introduction of this series historical ground water information was published in U S Geological Survey Water Supply Papers issues 4 html Salt Water Intrusion Saltwater intrusion the invasion of fresh water by saltwater from the sea or from marine deposits due to ground water withdrawal threatens ground water supplies in many areas along the California coast A variety of hydraulic and geochemical techniques may be applied to determine the sources and mechanical causes of the saltwater intrusion Once the causes are determined changes in spatial distribution and quantity of ground water pumpage along with surface water deliveries for artificial recharge are likely to be required to control intrusion Current studies are applying solute transport and hydraulic optimization modeling techniques to evaluate management options for controlling seawater intrusion in multiaquifer systems issues 5 html Drinking Water Disinfection By products Drinking water is disinfected to kill or inactivate microorganisms bacteria protozoa viruses and other pathogens that cause serious diseases and death including cholera typhoid fever dysentery and hepatitis A While the health benefits of disinfecting public drinking water are indisputable disinfection processes do produce by products that can have their own long term health effects For this reason disinfection by products DBPs and their sources are studied by the U S Geological Survey and other organizations and drinking water concentrations are regulated by the U S Environmental Protection Agency issues 7 html Methyl Tertiary Butyl Ether MTBE Methyl tertiary butyl ether MTBE is used as a gasoline additive for several purposes It has been added in relatively low concentrations to increase octane ratings in premium grade fuels since the late 1970 s Beginning in the early 1990 s MTBE has been added in much http www epa gov swerust1 mtbe mtbefs2 pdf higher concentrations up to 15 percent to enhance gasoline combustion and reduce tailpipe emissions Gasoline producers are required to add a fuel oxygenate chemicals that aid combustion by increasing available oxygen to California http www arb ca gov cbg pub pub htm Phase II Reformulated Gasoline to reduce air pollution especially carbon monoxide MTBE is the most http www epa gov swerust1 mtbe mtbefs3 pdf common fuel oxygenate used in more than 80 percent of oxygenated fuels MTBE is credited with contributing to significant http www epa gov OST drinking mtbe html reductions in carbon monoxide and ozone levels in many of these areas issues 8 html Surface Water The U S Geological Survey USGS stream gaging program provides streamflow data for a variety of purposes that range from current needs such as flood forecasting to future or long term needs such as detection of changes in streamflow due to human activities or global warming The development of data on the flow of the Nation s rivers mirrors the development of the country issues 9 html Water Quality QW in California Unlike some of the other topical categories which address specific processes water quality is a broad term for conditions that render water unfit for some use Although most commonly applied to contamination of water by dissolved or suspended chemical constituents the term also includes physical degradation for example due to changes in temperature and the amount of suspended sediment Water quality degradation in California is caused by a wide variety of processes some naturally occurring and some man induced The State Water Resources Control Board Water Quality Assessment concludes that agriculture is the largest source of water quality degradation of rivers streams and ground water in California Other major sources are silviculture leaking underground storage tanks urban runoff septic and sewage treatment systems mining and industry The three most predominant pollutants responsible for impairment of rivers and streams are pesticides sediment and pathogens and for ground water are salinity nutrients and pesticides horizontal rule http firstgov gov FirstGov Your First Click to the
