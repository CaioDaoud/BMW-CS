Link tools tool main cfm tools tool main cfm Downloads Tools Copyright 2003 California Arts Council All Rights Reserved California Resale Royalties Act The California Resale Royalty Act Civil Code section 986 entitles artists upon the resale of their works of art to a royalty payment under certain circumstances However in part because many artists are unaware of their rights and in part because some artists are afraid to assert their rights enormous sums of money due to artists have gone uncollected This California law is unique in the United States although a well established legal right in many other countries of the world The California Resale Royalty Act provides that with a few exceptions if a work of art is resold for 1 000 or more and that price exceeds the price the seller paid for that work of art the seller must pay the artist 5 percent of that resale price Although some sellers either out of ignorance or intransigence have failed to pay resale royalties which were owed to artists countless artists have successfully collected resale royalties ranging from 50 to several thousand dollars For example in 1981 when Ghiradelli Square in San Francisco was sold artist Ruth Asawa was paid a 5 000 resale royalty That sum represented 5 percent of the appraised value of the fountain she created some years earlier which had been sold along with the rest of Ghiradelli Square Another interesting case involved Sacramento artist Jack Nielsen His sculpture was part of an office complex whose owner went bankrupt When the real estate including his sculpture was sold in foreclosure Nielsen sued claiming that although the office complex had declined in value the sculpture he created had appreciated from 30 000 to 125 000 and he was entitled to a resale royalty He won To qualify for a resale royalty the work of art sold must have been a painting sculpture drawing or an original work of art in glass Either the seller must be a California resident or the resale must have taken place in California In addition the artist must either be an American citizen or if not have been a California resident for the past three years Although it does not matter when the work of art was created its resale must have occurred either during the life of the artist or within 20 years thereafter In the latter case the resale royalty would be claimed by the artist s estate Certain sales by an art dealer will not generate a resale royalty Under this law it is the seller s obligation to locate the artist and pay the royalty due If the seller is unable to locate the artist within 90 days after the sale the seller is required to pay the royalty due to the artist to the California Arts Council where it will be held for the artist for seven years If the artist fails to claim the money due within that time the money reverts to the California Arts Council for use in its Art in Public Buildings Program It is impossible to determine precisely how many royalties have been paid and how many have not been paid Nevertheless it is clear that compliance will improve as more and more sellers learn when they must pay this resale royalty as more artists understand this law and become willing to assert their rights Artists should always maintain current records of the location of their works of art This will be invaluable when artists wish to assemble their art for the retrospective It may also help artists learn of resales of any of their art It should also be useful for artists to know that the California Resale Royalty Act entitles an artist to recover reasonable attorney s fees if a successful lawsuit is brought to recover the resale royalty Most often a letter from a lawyer advising the seller of the law s application is enough to assure payment of the resale royalty If the artist does not have a good lawyer the artist is invited to contact the California Lawyers for the Arts CLA a statewide nonprofit organization which among other things can provide a referral to a lawyer For more information contact the San Francisco office of CLA at 415 775 7200 CLA also has offices in Santa Monica 310 998 5590 and Sacramento 916 442 6210 This right of artists to share in the appreciated value of their works when resold is important both in principle and in dollars Artists are encouraged to assert their rights
