cfm Seminars Meetings minutes Meeting Minutes http apps nwfsc noaa gov Link to salmon data management team image is team emblem Mission Purpose To provide NWFSC scientists and technical staff working with spatial data the opportunity to share data ideas and to allow better collaboration To provide a forum for technical and applied research seminars to educate users about new techniques methods and applications of spatial analyses To provide a forum for the NWFSC s http apps nwfsc noaa gov Spatial Data Management Team SDM to regularly meet with new and existing Center users to discuss GIS software licensing data needs and technical questions To provide technical support for Center staff in determining appropriate methods of analyzing spatial data Background The nature of our work here at the NWFSC has a strong spatial component because of the scope and diversity of scientific research being conducted on freshwater and marine fishes as well as other GIS map showing land cover classification and stream network used to estimate percentage of stream reaches with functioning riparian zone landcover by Lunetta et al 1997 organisms A spatial component is inherent in all biological data and GIS is the bridge that allows the link between biological information and the environment This bridge allows us to evaluate a multitude of co occurring complex ecological features in a spatial model which allows us to visualize these features as well as developing hypotheses and conducting analyses GIS also allows users to visually represent this information for distribution to others in papers meetings and presentations Who Are We We currently have 30 users on the User s Group mailing list and the group is comprised of individuals currently notified about SDM Team GIS license and software issues The list is primarily comprised of NWFSC employees with some AFSC individuals The meeting group is completely open to any and all who are interested Our user base spans a range of expertise and research interests including GIS map showing anthropogenic barriers to fish migration on the Molalla River Oregon Barriers were used as hydrologic pour points and to estimate upstream watershed characteristics modeling of hydrologic features prediction of potential fish habitat assessment of geomorphic landscape attributes analysis of land use and estuarine changes benthic marine habitat mapping Seminars Meetings Seminar topics focus on scale related topics in ecology terrestrial and aquatic change detection hydrology geomorphology remote sensing marine terrestrial freshwater spatial tools spatial database development data structures user interfaces and programming applications in GIS sdmview cfm View of SDM Users Site Meetings are currently held on a monthly basis Date varies due to availability of speakers Depending on the pertinence of the topic email notification of upcoming meetings will be sent to the Users lists and in some cases all Center staff
